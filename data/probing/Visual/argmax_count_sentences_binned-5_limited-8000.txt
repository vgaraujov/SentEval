tr	3	But it was not here .
tr	4	The Bible would be staying here .
tr	1	It 's a long hike . "
tr	0	A very bad idea .
tr	0	And he wasn 't fat .
tr	0	Noah was just a big guy .
tr	2	Could you overdose on Raid ?
tr	4	She felt like a fake .
tr	3	At least a little .
tr	0	He also wasn 't a bad shot .
tr	1	This was his team .
tr	1	This was life in Pakistan .
tr	2	" Oh come on you guys !
tr	2	Alejo fought a sour expression .
tr	1	Stalin was grinning , amused .
tr	1	This was getting ridiculous .
tr	2	" I 'll tell you .
tr	4	Even without Ruben , it was enough .
tr	2	" It 's a good choice .
tr	0	And thanks for the empanada . "
tr	2	How 's it going Noah ? "
tr	1	" Uh , sure .
tr	0	I was feeling a little awkward . "
tr	3	All right , that 's it !
tr	0	This is really awkward .
tr	1	We 're , uh , really sorry .
tr	2	Rudolf had stood and was apologizing .
tr	1	" It can happen to anyone .
tr	3	This wasn 't going to be pretty .
tr	1	Ok , yes it was .
tr	1	" I won 't tell anyone .
tr	1	Alejo frowned at the stuff suspiciously .
tr	1	" It 's just not possible .
tr	0	Allah has no son .
tr	2	I 'll have to tell them . "
tr	2	Or something , I don 't know .
tr	0	The Americans had apologized .
tr	4	" For the first time ever .
tr	1	It 's still ours .
tr	0	But why should he even do that ?
tr	0	And he was a really good sniper .
tr	4	The training had been excellent .
tr	0	Pakistanis had them beat .
tr	2	Now , on to his babies .
tr	3	That left the money .
tr	0	Gabriel gasped in Pashto .
tr	0	They had followed him from the bank !
tr	4	You 've been a fool , Gabriel .
tr	0	" Hold him ! "
tr	0	What 's with the chess game ?
tr	2	I 'm not dead .
tr	2	" Don 't move .
tr	2	Was Alejo looking about to cry ?
tr	2	" Someone found you .
tr	2	Your life belongs to him now . "
tr	4	What if he messed up ?
tr	0	Allah had saved him by a miracle .
tr	0	Now he had to pay Allah back .
tr	3	But it was more than that .
tr	3	At least it felt that way .
tr	3	It 's getting late . "
tr	2	Decided they just couldn 't do it .
tr	2	And it had to be something good ?
tr	2	" I know , " Gabriel nodded .
tr	2	But I should be dead . "
tr	1	" I 'm starving . "
tr	2	" Hey , good morning ! "
tr	0	" Come on and have breakfast !
tr	0	" Thanks for breakfast . "
tr	1	I saw him . "
tr	2	" Do you know why ? "
tr	1	Can you hurry this up ? "
tr	2	How did you know ?
tr	2	" I 'll call you back . "
tr	0	And why shouldn 't he ?
tr	0	But I have an idea .
tr	2	" Of course , " Alejo said .
tr	3	" It 's getting late . "
tr	4	" Aren 't the falls awesome ? "
tr	2	" Yep , " Eduardo said .
tr	0	This was tropical paradise .
tr	1	" Tu , mujer ! "
tr	2	" You , woman ! "
tr	0	" Hey , guys ! "
tr	1	she said in English , waving .
tr	0	" Yeah , " Noah said .
tr	2	" Go up front ! "
tr	3	" Is that you ? "
tr	1	she said , unsteadily .
tr	4	" Yeah , it 's me . "
tr	3	" I 'm getting out ! "
tr	2	I 'll go ? "
tr	0	" Noah , just go away ! "
tr	1	She 's really serious .
tr	2	I 'll catch you later . "
tr	1	" Alright , sure .
tr	2	Do you have room ? "
tr	2	" We have lots of room .
tr	0	" How much ? "
tr	4	" What time does it leave ? "
tr	4	he realized he should have asked first .
tr	1	It 's leaving right now . "
tr	0	" Are you mad ? "
tr	2	Not very comfortable clothes for traveling .
tr	3	She 's not talking to me .
tr	3	Things that had happened that first year .
tr	2	Had she really done all this ?
tr	3	But it was all true .
tr	2	" And God forgave you . "
tr	0	His grip on her hands tightened .
tr	0	And he was staring at her .
tr	0	Noah was touching her ?
tr	2	How could you ? "
tr	2	You actually love me ? "
tr	1	And then it was gone .
tr	0	Not one of Salazar 's staff .
tr	2	" Your bus has been bombed ? "
tr	0	Alejo snapped , pushing William back hard .
tr	1	Wasn 't supposed to happen . "
tr	0	" Always such a gentleman .
tr	1	She 's a witness .
tr	0	Only Salazar and his staff .
tr	3	We 'll start tomorrow at six .
tr	1	Last session before it 's over . "
tr	2	" Good work everyone .
tr	1	She 's a witness . "
tr	2	Everything 's going to work out . "
tr	0	" What are you guys talking about ?
tr	0	" What 's your name ? "
tr	0	He married a Quechua lady .
tr	1	" Cuts from broken glass ? "
tr	1	And this girl in front of him .
tr	2	And then look for his family .
tr	4	11 coffee SHE MUST BE SHOCK .
tr	3	That couldn 't be right .
tr	1	And now you 're a witness . "
tr	0	What are you waiting for ? "
tr	1	She was so thirsty .
tr	1	She was just fine .
tr	3	Don 't try to escape .
tr	0	And Paulo switched off the camping lamp .
tr	2	How could you do that ?
tr	0	In a Bolivian language . "
tr	2	" You got me . "
tr	1	Or a couple earrings . "
tr	2	Tobin and Tobias could get one too .
tr	4	Before they killed her .
tr	0	Was it almost early morning ?
tr	1	These guys are Muslims .
tr	4	His face confirmed everything .
tr	1	Or a Muslim terrorist ?
tr	1	How is my sister ? "
tr	0	But she was also afraid .
tr	1	" Are you a terrorist ? "
tr	0	I really hate Alejandro .
tr	0	This was a nightmare .
tr	3	The ones that are left I trust .
tr	0	What choice did she have ?
tr	1	She was his prisoner , right ?
tr	2	So far so good .
tr	0	" Uh , hi . "
tr	0	" My name is Gabriel Shara . "
tr	1	" We read your passport .
tr	0	But I hardly have any cuts .
tr	4	Animated conversation drew nearer outside the tent .
tr	1	This could not be happening .
tr	0	She hated him for it .
tr	2	he finally said coolly .
tr	2	" How could you do this ?
tr	2	How could you want to kill him ?
tr	3	Get me through this part ?
tr	4	Her eyes were beginning to swell .
tr	2	Oh God , I 'm so sorry .
tr	1	Everything is spinning around so fast .
tr	1	" My friends are very smart .
tr	2	" You broke my nose ! "
tr	0	The thought made her frown .
tr	2	" So , who are you ? "
tr	0	" You have a handler ?
tr	2	" But you have a Bible .
tr	1	Alejo turned towards her sharply .
tr	1	We 're not terrorists . "
tr	2	Alejo was still frowning darkly .
tr	2	What are we going to do ? "
tr	0	" Ya , " Alejo said .
tr	1	" I can fly it . "
tr	3	I won 't tell the Khan .
tr	1	Alejo tried his most convincing smile .
tr	1	" My sister still uses that ?
tr	1	Some of us still use it . "
tr	1	I knew it ! "
tr	0	That girl was always on Facebook .
tr	1	I am here with your brother .
tr	4	" Well meet them there . "
tr	1	This is a lot of bling .
tr	0	Franco Salazar must be dead .
tr	0	He had thought this out .
tr	1	I am a murderer .
tr	2	And who are you now ?
tr	2	Do you even know ?
tr	1	They 're terrorists ! "
tr	2	For a second no one could speak .
tr	3	What is going to happen to them ?
tr	2	He was almost looking forward to it .
tr	2	Alejo nearly shot out of his chair .
tr	2	" Thank God you did ? "
tr	3	I just can 't .
tr	0	" Maybe someday we can talk .
tr	0	His mother was right .
tr	2	" I already did .
tr	2	" Of course they do , Alejandro .
tr	0	And maybe I am .
tr	2	You sound so cold .
tr	2	" Why did you do it ? "
tr	1	My group is made up of Muslims .
tr	0	That 's a place ? "
tr	1	I can 't fix it . "
tr	2	How could you do this ? "
tr	1	Alejo 's eyes radiated hurt and horror .
tr	2	No , of course not . "
tr	2	" They probably forgot .
tr	2	Alejo was still telling his story .
tr	1	I am a murderer .
tr	0	" Franco Salazar ? "
tr	3	" I just heard last night .
tr	2	Come back to Bolivia someday ?
tr	2	No , you go on .
tr	2	You don 't know them .
tr	0	I think you should stay here . "
tr	0	" Alright , " she managed .
tr	2	Oh , this was not good .
tr	1	" Si , amigo ? "
tr	3	It was all just too much .
tr	3	That last sentence was muttered .
tr	3	It had to hurt .
tr	1	As if she would .
tr	1	" I guess so ... Dad .
tr	2	About both of you . "
tr	0	From Noah 's church .
tr	2	Can you do it ? "
tr	0	It was her last chance .
tr	2	" You 're still alive .
tr	3	Why did it really matter ?
tr	0	Eduardo was actually grinning .
tr	0	What are you waiting for ? '
tr	4	He knew several great girls .
tr	0	Noah was just plain scared of commitment !
tr	2	" His mom and dad . "
tr	2	Who could eat now ?
tr	0	" Are you Noah 's parents ? "
tr	1	I was his girlfriend . "
tr	0	He was alive for nearly two days !
tr	4	She had nearly forgotten about his existence .
tr	4	He should be miserable .
tr	2	" My thermal imaging goggles . "
tr	1	Gabriel 's voice was light .
tr	3	What 's gotten into you guys ? "
tr	2	You know what you 've done . "
tr	0	Now he 's mad as a hornet .
tr	3	" You can 't do that . "
tr	0	" You 're an apostate ? "
tr	1	Now no one was in sight .
tr	2	Alejo couldn 't help himself .
tr	0	" And the American ? "
tr	1	His strong voice carried across the garden .
tr	3	It wasn 't what God wanted .
tr	0	Ah , Alejo ! "
tr	2	I took you in ? "
tr	2	About my work ? "
tr	2	Allah will forgive you . "
tr	0	" He 's an apostate , Ishmael .
tr	0	He can 't come back . "
tr	1	" Is that necessary ? "
tr	0	Are you a Christian ? "
tr	1	But she was shaking .
tr	2	How could he be so stupid ?
tr	2	" It 's our job .
tr	2	He 's still alive .
tr	2	" He 's still alive ! "
tr	3	Take him to the hospital .
tr	2	You 've got to run , ok ?
tr	4	He shouldn 't be alive .
tr	2	But he 's still alive .
tr	0	Caf Amara , vestiges of another dimension .
tr	2	" You don 't know ? "
tr	2	" Of course you know !
tr	2	We prayed for you so much .
tr	4	Her knees trembled beneath her .
tr	0	" He was shot in the head .
tr	1	" Oh , that is serious ! "
tr	1	I loved this city .
tr	2	From the direction of Alejo 's room .
tr	1	I 'm sorry . "
tr	3	I don 't have to watch this .
tr	0	And stayed that way .
tr	2	" It 's still the swelling .
tr	1	Staring at the ceiling and seeing nothing .
tr	2	Tomorrow couldn 't come fast enough .
tr	2	His mom would be so proud .
tr	3	But that was just the problem .
tr	2	There was so much to do .
tr	0	Manuel knew what today meant .
tr	0	And Allah knew all about it .
tr	0	After all , this was good-bye .
tr	2	Of course he wasn 't ok .
tr	3	I still can 't see though .
tr	1	What was she supposed to say ?
tr	2	He did not sound happy .
tr	1	This isn 't the same bus .
tr	4	Where are you ? "
tr	1	" I 'm in the bus . "
tr	3	The doctor said it might .
tr	2	I could see it all !
tr	4	Yeah , I remember that .
tr	4	Please come back . "
tr	2	" We 'll go to Lima .
tr	2	God is calling for you .
tr	0	He gave him back his sight .
tr	2	And He wants you to go .
tr	2	Did you tell Dr. Ortega ? "
tr	2	He nodded at her and winked .
tr	2	" I 'll go . "
tr	0	No trace of a scar .
tr	2	" No one will recognize you . "
tr	1	Grab anything you need . "
tr	2	" A very good question . "
tr	0	You already met Sandal and Tabor . "
tr	4	Rupert 's eyes crinkled slightly again .
tr	0	Alejo did not appear at all fazed .
tr	0	With Tabor and Sandal .
tr	0	It was as clear as day .
tr	1	Am I right ? "
tr	2	" How did you know ? "
tr	0	Aymara for star . "
tr	3	I think you both understand that . "
tr	1	" Gabriel , you idiot !
tr	1	My life is a mess .
tr	1	" Your brother works at the embassy .
tr	1	" I guess I did .
tr	0	So much had changed .
tr	4	Rupert really did make strong coffee .
tr	4	" You saved her life . "
tr	1	" Umm , I don 't ?
tr	1	" I 'm sorry .
tr	3	It 's pretty simple .
tr	0	Rupert waved one hairy hand at him .
tr	1	" She was . "
tr	4	Rupert seemed much too delighted .
tr	4	Rupert 's eyes glowed .
tr	1	" I love it . "
tr	4	Please , forgive me . "
tr	3	" But I can 't ? "
tr	1	It was one thing to forgive him .
tr	3	Trusting him was quite another .
tr	0	One day at a time .
tr	3	And it had to start somewhere .
tr	0	The number wasn 't hers , though .
tr	3	I just stood there .
tr	0	" And Ishmael ? "
tr	3	Yes , that 's right .
tr	3	Is that creepy , or what ? "
tr	2	Alejo hoped this was a good sign .
tr	1	My fingers are cramping . "
tr	1	And a non-Catholic one .
tr	4	Where were those kinds of books here ?
tr	1	Stalin blinked in surprise .
tr	4	" Ok , quite a few .
tr	1	I 'm sorry . "
tr	2	" You have to come now . "
tr	0	Noah hadn 't made it .
tr	0	A sharp crack sounded in the foliage .
tr	0	This was a ranch , after all .
tr	3	That was ok , wasn 't it ?
tr	2	" Holy cow ! "
tr	2	" Holy cow ! "
tr	0	It was making her crazy .
tr	1	Like , fight with you ?
tr	1	" Get off of me ! "
tr	3	But that was her last move .
tr	0	A sharp crack sounded in the clearing .
tr	1	This could not be happening .
tr	2	" Don 't shoot ! "
tr	1	" Get off ! "
tr	0	It was really a beautiful day .
tr	0	By mid-morning , that had all changed .
tr	2	Or so we thought .
tr	0	Halfway across the traverse , Isaac stopped .
tr	2	Grow some balls and move .
tr	0	Isaac had not been swept away .
tr	0	Isaac was gone again .
tr	4	A sick feeling swept over me .
tr	1	This was really going to suck .
tr	2	I shouted out over the howling winds .
tr	3	It 's that simple .
tr	1	It was no use .
tr	0	That Diamond was literally covered in snow .
tr	2	" Oh my God ! "
tr	4	I remember saying to myself .
tr	1	" Is this it ?
tr	3	I felt a tug ... then another .
tr	2	For a moment , it was over .
tr	4	Isaac shouted over the wind .
tr	2	" So , what do you think ?
tr	0	Isaac asked , grinning ear to ear .
tr	0	" It 's a cake walk !
tr	1	Your turn dude ! "
tr	2	Then Mom could stay home too . "
tr	2	" Not for a long time .
tr	3	Trae blurted out in quick reaction .
tr	3	" Just a minute , Trae .
tr	1	" Du n no .
tr	1	" Lena , get moving NOW ! "
tr	2	" I 'll block you .
tr	2	GO , NOW ! "
tr	4	The valley below became awake .
tr	2	I love you . "
tr	1	Just be careful of your fingers though .
tr	3	Wouldn 't it be faster ? "
tr	2	" Yes , doctor .
tr	1	Dr. Warner replied urgently .
tr	4	" She needs volume NOW .
tr	4	Desperation could be heard as he spoke .
tr	2	" Belly 's full of blood .
tr	0	" Careful ; watch the trauma .
tr	4	Anyone know the caliber of bullet ? "
tr	1	" I 'm on it .
tr	1	Dr. Warner asked rhetorically .
tr	3	Just then , the cardiac monitor sounded .
tr	3	" Charge to twenty .
tr	0	Dr. Warner frantically called again .
tr	1	Instantly , the doors sprung open .
tr	1	Dr. Warner , stop ! "
tr	3	He just wanted to forget .
tr	0	" Hey , you .
tr	2	Suddenly it dawned on him .
tr	1	How is this possible ? "
tr	3	At first , David hesitated .
tr	0	" What the hell ? "
tr	2	" Whoa , son !
tr	3	" Outfit , lad .
tr	2	Who 's your commanding officer ? "
tr	0	" This way , lad .
tr	1	Are you gray or blue ? "
tr	1	" Hmm , skilled practitioner you say ?
tr	2	Are you a doctor ? "
tr	0	" Harvard you say ?
tr	2	David responded in kind .
tr	1	Is this accord satisfactory ? "
tr	1	Dr. Morgan questioned with concern .
tr	3	" Doctor , I must protest .
tr	4	" Repair the veins and arteries ?
tr	1	Is this possible ? "
tr	2	" Ok , son .
tr	2	Dr. Morgan looked on in total fascination .
tr	1	Taller , for sure .
tr	2	No one complained that I took cuts .
tr	2	I followed the winding hallway .
tr	1	I wanted anything blue , not pink .
tr	2	Lots of pink among the girls .
tr	1	Everyone was running away from the building .
tr	4	The spotlights were scanning everywhere .
tr	3	Straight down a slippery tube .
tr	2	Who could know my name ?
tr	0	" A hard case ? "
tr	4	Well , that sort of made sense .
tr	3	" That 's Jim ! "
tr	3	At least I didn 't .
tr	0	" What 's in your bag ? "
tr	1	Did I hear right ?
tr	1	Didn 't you pick it up ? "
tr	2	Who are you ? "
tr	2	Open it , would you ? "
tr	0	I could rock climb .
tr	2	Oops , I had to hurry .
tr	1	Yes , convenient , I know .
tr	1	" Now listen . "
tr	4	Had they been whispering too loudly ?
tr	0	She thought of March .
tr	2	Not potato chips , chocolate chips .
tr	1	" Your father 's grandfather . "
tr	3	" That 's stupid . "
tr	1	" Mr. Stark ? "
tr	0	And what do I call him ?
tr	2	" He didn 't say . "
tr	2	That would be good .
tr	3	It 's so pretty . "
tr	0	" We are at the hard part .
tr	0	" Half an inch , huh ?
tr	1	" After your ancestors , I guess .
tr	0	She looked again at the small windows .
tr	4	But where would someone hide now ?
tr	4	She was definitely being spied on .
tr	1	Or just Great for short .
tr	2	The room was cozy but cramped .
tr	0	It 's already made .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	3	It 's pretty cool . "
tr	3	Kevin was pointing to the left .
tr	3	What 's behind that last door ?
tr	0	" Yeah , right .
tr	1	My parents don 't even know . "
tr	2	" Well ... okay . "
tr	0	" Scary , huh ? "
tr	1	" It 's practically invisible . "
tr	1	It was so soft .
tr	3	Missy went down the attic ladder first .
tr	4	They were going to spend the night .
tr	2	And I really like your lodge .
tr	3	But that 's okay .
tr	2	This will be really fun . "
tr	2	I 'll show you your room .
tr	1	" Hi , Kevin .
tr	0	What 'd you make ? "
tr	1	" Sounds cool , " Missy smiled .
tr	2	But you 'll like them all .
tr	4	There 's a schedule right there . "
tr	2	" Look really close . "
tr	3	What 's the trick ?
tr	4	Had he seen the elevator ?
tr	4	Missy 's great-grandfather owned Big Pine Lodge .
tr	0	A car was coming .
tr	3	I don 't trust them .
tr	2	" Oh , no ! "
tr	2	No telling what they 'll do . "
tr	2	Should I go get dad ? "
tr	1	She just shrugged her shoulders .
tr	1	" Guess it 's something bad . "
tr	2	" Me , too . "
tr	2	" You row a boat .
tr	1	I think I heard something . "
tr	1	She said nothing as she climbed down .
tr	3	At first it was darker still .
tr	2	I 'll lead . "
tr	3	Lonnie thought about that for a while .
tr	3	They walked without talking .
tr	0	" What are you ?
tr	1	Missy and Kevin stayed absolutely still .
tr	3	That ought to stop the boys .
tr	2	" We almost got you ! "
tr	4	" You have the key ? "
tr	1	Kevin was still whispering .
tr	0	" What the heck is this ? "
tr	3	They won 't talk to him . "
tr	1	My brother snores . "
tr	0	" How mean what guys are ? "
tr	0	" Oh , yeah .
tr	3	Let 's go check it out . "
tr	4	" Let 's see the stables . "
tr	1	Missy had her duties , too .
tr	2	We 'll pick some wildflowers .
tr	3	He started pushing up on the trapdoor .
tr	0	They high-fived each other and laughed hysterically .
tr	0	Dave with dark hair . "
tr	4	" You didn 't beach the canoe .
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	0	" Was that a gun ? "
tr	2	Ricky looked at Lonnie .
tr	1	Lonnie picked up a riding crop .
tr	2	" Who do you want to ride ?
tr	1	Missy always had dibs on Misty .
tr	3	" That 's weird . "
tr	4	I feel like being nice . "
tr	2	Lonnie nodded his head .
tr	1	" He 's just small . "
tr	1	" Surprised to see us ? "
tr	0	" That was hilarious ! "
tr	4	" Come here , Jackson .
tr	3	Get off that horse . "
tr	0	Their mother was pushing them onward now .
tr	1	" I 'm Missy Stark .
tr	1	" Let 's finish your ride . "
tr	0	Yeah , right , Missy thought .
tr	4	" Where have you two been ? "
tr	1	" Whatever , " Missy said .
tr	2	" You think of something . "
tr	3	Just a little sand in their sheets .
tr	2	They 'll be itching all night . "
tr	1	Lonnie huffed and spit on the ground .
tr	0	She was always so friendly and happy .
tr	1	" Hi , Mrs. Jackson .
tr	1	I love it . "
tr	3	They can hand that to you .
tr	1	Ricky asked his brother .
tr	3	" What 's the matter ? "
tr	0	Angela started to laugh .
tr	3	What could they be up to ?
tr	0	A rock , maybe .
tr	2	" We should have our own . "
tr	0	" What 's he doing ? "
tr	3	" That 's what I thought .
tr	1	It was kinda funny , though . "
tr	2	Ricky came out and crossed the room .
tr	2	" Who do you think , dummy ?
tr	2	Ricky looked at Lonnie .
tr	0	" What 's your idea ?
tr	0	Catch them at an embarrassing moment ? "
tr	0	Am I a bear or what ? "
tr	2	" Well , hello , boys . "
tr	0	How could he explain this ?
tr	2	" Of course ! "
tr	2	Grandma thought he would buy books .
tr	2	Oh , no , girls .
tr	1	Tommy was momentarily stunned .
tr	4	Both sisters answered at the same time .
tr	1	" It 's hers .
tr	1	His name is Boots . "
tr	2	Noodle did chase Boots .
tr	0	He pinched himself and it hurt .
tr	3	It was just over that hill .
tr	2	Suddenly a voice stopped him cold .
tr	2	" What did you do ? "
tr	4	They 're almost dead !
tr	2	Tommy got up and nodded .
tr	2	" There you go , boy .
tr	4	He smelled the top .
tr	2	" How rude , boy !
tr	0	What kind of help ?
tr	2	So what could I do for you ?
tr	1	How did she climb up so fast ?
tr	4	Time was all screwed up here .
tr	3	They felt like giant mosquito bites .
tr	3	Tommy didn 't have the slightest idea .
tr	0	Why would he do that ?
tr	0	He thought he knew .
tr	1	The dungeon couldn 't have grown .
tr	1	" I 'm Tommy .
tr	1	I 'm in the dungeon . "
tr	2	What did you do ? "
tr	3	" Then I want to meet you .
tr	1	In an instant the dungeon went black .
tr	1	The furniture was plentiful and luxurious .
tr	2	You 're out of the dungeon .
tr	0	Tommy had short , short hair .
tr	1	For an instant Tommy was confused .
tr	0	What 's your name ? "
tr	1	Is it magic ? "
tr	2	At school , " Tommy answered .
tr	2	Tommy took one and put it on .
tr	2	Usually we all had them with us .
tr	2	No cells phones at school !
tr	2	" It 's not poop . "
tr	1	" Is this Bigfoot ? "
tr	3	" No ants , " Austin stated .
tr	1	I said in a hoarse whisper .
tr	2	Longer legs , you know .
tr	2	So I stopped , too .
tr	3	" But what about the monster ? "
tr	2	I was cool , though .
tr	0	" Callie , band aid . "
tr	3	Nothing gets to that girl .
tr	1	I wasn 't falling for it .
tr	0	I made a face .
tr	1	I picked a direction .
tr	2	Way to not be cool .
tr	0	There it was again .
tr	3	" The Bigfoot , " Austin breathed .
tr	3	That 's what we did .
tr	4	I might have been , too .
tr	3	Okay , back to the hysteria thing .
tr	0	So , it was Natalie .
tr	1	" Sydney tripped in it .
tr	3	That got me nervous .
tr	0	Maybe the creature was tracking Natalie .
tr	2	You know , a victim alone .
tr	1	Her internal compass was still broken .
tr	2	I 'm not thinking clearly at all .
tr	4	The nightmares often keep him up .
tr	2	I could almost forget my own name .
tr	1	Gabe shifts in his sleep .
tr	0	And right now I wish he had .
tr	1	Monster hands reaching out .
tr	1	This is me coming alive .
tr	2	Tears flowing for Nabokov and Tolstoy .
tr	0	His hand brought the island to life .
tr	0	All are warm , honest and hardworking .
tr	2	It 's all very foolish .
tr	1	I will find my orphan girl .
tr	1	His lips find mine .
tr	3	but I don 't think so .
tr	4	" We are leaving now . "
tr	1	Something is coming off him .
tr	1	I start to slide across the cobblestones .
tr	3	We lift up into the sky .
tr	4	Chapter 3 We fly .
tr	2	I pull my legs into my chest .
tr	2	His voice comes from above .
tr	0	A wail crawls up my throat .
tr	1	" Did you kill him ?
tr	1	Did you kill him ? "
tr	0	The shoes walk away .
tr	0	I am not brave .
tr	1	I wipe my nose again .
tr	4	I never even heard a sound .
tr	0	I realize that Ryan isn 't dead .
tr	2	The man looks down at me .
tr	0	A dog yips far away .
tr	3	Taste of tears in my mouth .
tr	1	His voice sounds hoarse .
tr	1	Big and golden-brown like honey .
tr	1	A song is humming softly .
tr	0	He turns his head up .
tr	3	Who 's telling the story ?
tr	2	" You two ! "
tr	1	His muscles bulged beneath his shirt .
tr	3	The fight was totally epic .
tr	3	You ever think of that ?
tr	3	It was meat confetti .
tr	3	It was pretty sick .
tr	1	She was their long lost sister .
tr	2	The door wasn 't locked .
tr	3	We didn 't get a kill shot .
tr	0	Grand had Gabe pinned to the wall .
tr	4	I knew what had to be done .
tr	0	He was already emotionally attached .
tr	4	We didn 't have time to argue .
tr	3	... No , that 's it .
tr	2	Great , gaping hunger .
tr	1	I am shivering , still sweating .
tr	0	After a moment it opens again .
tr	1	He is so close .
tr	1	The car is moving .
tr	0	We had him . "
tr	3	He turns to look at the driver .
tr	1	" I 'm fine .
tr	3	Just twisted it a little .
tr	3	Ditch the guns too .
tr	0	Damn shame , though . "
tr	3	Not that you care .
tr	1	Anyone can get Glocks . "
tr	1	I can 't stop shivering .
tr	3	The fire is starting to separate .
tr	4	He can 't be .
tr	1	He grabs my shoulders and pulls .
tr	1	Pant legs intrude into my visual field .
tr	2	She only got one shot .
tr	2	" His blood . "
tr	2	" You done ? "
tr	1	" I mean no !
tr	0	She can fight with us .
tr	4	He pulls in a deep breath .
tr	1	She is Grand 's daughter .
tr	3	Just get out of my way . "
tr	1	Gabe spreads his arms .
tr	3	" Is that what this is ? "
tr	4	We 're family . "
tr	4	" We have to keep moving .
tr	0	Grand will want her back .
tr	2	He 'll track us . "
tr	1	I am still holding mine .
tr	1	A gun sticks out of his waistband .
tr	1	" Am I going to die ? "
tr	0	They are a warm brown like caramel .
tr	0	Gabe is speaking again .
tr	3	The last part is a mutter .
tr	2	The door opens and closes .
tr	2	I am too busy dying to care .
tr	0	Thin scarlet threads through his energy .
tr	2	I 'll let you know . "
tr	3	" Shit , " he mutters .
tr	1	I could grab him .
tr	2	I feel an explosion of cooling ecstasy .
tr	3	He is not distracted .
tr	1	" The cuffs , " I moan .
tr	0	Gabe laughs and shakes his head .
tr	2	Lots of people have pointy chins .
tr	2	" I have something for you . "
tr	3	I just can 't .
tr	3	The shirt is too large .
tr	0	" What am I ?
tr	3	What did that man do to me ?
tr	1	Gabe sits up and scratches his cap .
tr	0	Gabe looks away into the distance .
tr	4	I checked for a pulse .
tr	4	Not me , monster me is here .
tr	0	Gabe looks at me then away quickly .
tr	3	" That 's what they call themselves .
tr	2	" It 'll sound crazy . "
tr	4	He created the angels .
tr	1	He was a scientist . "
tr	3	The opposite , actually . "
tr	0	Pretty damned brazen actually . "
tr	4	Maybe even human flight . "
tr	2	You just don 't know me . "
tr	1	I 'm sorry Ryan .
tr	1	It 's really inefficient .
tr	1	Guy was a distinguished university professor .
tr	0	That sounds familiar . "
tr	0	" Oh yeah . "
tr	1	" He was assassinated .
tr	2	" Okay , stop . "
tr	1	Gabe sighs and squints into the sun .
tr	1	I usually drink it every morning .
tr	2	What they found was Dr. Cook .
tr	1	" I said move ! "
tr	1	" Shut up . "
tr	1	" Her wrists are all torn up .
tr	0	Gabe 's aura rears up .
tr	1	She 's not ! "
tr	3	" Forget it . "
tr	1	Somehow this is funny .
tr	1	" Gloves , " I say .
tr	2	" I 'll wear gloves .
tr	1	Warm lips filled with electricity .
tr	2	What they found was Dr. Cook .
tr	3	Not until it was too late . "
tr	2	" Not to you . "
tr	0	Gabe clears his throat .
tr	0	That man 's name was Canton Fox .
tr	0	Gabe 's eyes go far away .
tr	1	His words are soft .
tr	1	" Gabe , this is serious .
tr	3	She 's got an acupuncturist appointment .
tr	2	" A lot of people sigh . "
tr	2	" Come on . "
tr	0	Wild , huh ? "
tr	2	He fell out of a boat .
tr	1	It all suddenly seems so vast .
tr	1	No more puppies . "
tr	2	" How 's this going to work ?
tr	0	Maya will be a bridesmaid .
tr	1	So this is Missouri .
tr	2	I hold up my gloved hands .
tr	2	Your incredible hospitality knows no bounds . "
tr	2	A soft knock on the door .
tr	1	I don 't answer .
tr	2	I open the door .
tr	3	My thirst seems to have no limit .
tr	1	It is more maddening then filling .
tr	0	Blasted poor bastards with radiation .
tr	0	" And that sucks , okay .
tr	1	Grand had too many connections .
tr	4	Not even the worst ones .
tr	0	How afraid she was . "
tr	0	" What was her name ? "
tr	1	And I kept writing .
tr	2	" Mom loved you .
tr	0	Afraid that you would be an angel .
tr	0	I can only manage a whisper .
tr	3	" It 's getting late . "
tr	0	He gathers up the trash .
tr	0	I look back at Gabe .
tr	1	I dip my hand into the bowl .
tr	4	A compromise is reached .
tr	3	The lights go out .
tr	2	Gabe falls asleep quickly .
tr	4	He seems so remorseless in the daylight .
tr	1	My mind is numb and empty .
tr	2	About being my brothers .
tr	0	This is probably a bad idea .
tr	1	I am giddy with fear .
tr	2	" Don 't move . "
tr	0	I want to break his calm .
tr	1	A second is an achingly long time .
tr	1	" Do it , " he says .
tr	2	" Don 't follow me . "
tr	0	" Maya wait ! "
tr	2	Grand will come for you .
tr	1	He 'll turn you into an angel .
tr	2	You 'll kill people .
tr	2	" I want to go home . "
tr	2	, " I look at Gabe helplessly .
tr	4	Gabe never lets go of my eyes .
tr	0	" Maya , take my hand . "
tr	1	" I ... I can 't . "
tr	1	This is pain burning toward implosion .
tr	2	I won 't let you fall .
tr	2	From now on we trust each other .
tr	2	They both look to me .
tr	1	" Okay , " I whisper .
tr	1	It hisses as I approach .
tr	0	As not okay as can be imagined .
tr	1	This is the loss of everything .
tr	3	It 's the typical father-daughter trope .
tr	0	You wanted a daughter ?
tr	2	Well , you got one !
tr	3	I keep forgetting not to think .
tr	1	He crosses his arms behind his head .
tr	2	No one bothers you .
tr	0	" Maya , quick ! "
tr	1	It 's in my bag . "
tr	1	No TV , no newspapers .
tr	2	You boys back in town , eh ?
tr	2	He watches out for you .
tr	1	Not a mean bone in his body .
tr	2	I almost choke on my spit .
tr	0	" Always lies and that big smile .
tr	1	" Lies , " Gabe says .
tr	4	The purple shades grow dark as wine .
tr	4	Whenever you have time .
tr	0	" Okay , " Francesca says .
tr	4	I watch her energy too .
tr	1	Still humming bird wings .
tr	4	" Nice to meet you Maya . "
tr	0	Twice a day . "
tr	1	We turn into a long driveway .
tr	0	" Oh yeah , " Gabe sighs .
tr	4	" Home sweet home . "
tr	3	I want to stay in the car .
tr	1	This is so awkward .
tr	2	Gabe looks to his brother .
tr	1	Let 's just go upstairs . "
tr	2	You 've got your own bathroom .
tr	1	Slim , round shoulders .
tr	0	He turns and walks away .
tr	0	He looks so much like his father .
tr	3	But I don 't cry .
tr	3	That part really is true .
tr	3	Something catches my attention .
tr	1	Wind kissing my face .
tr	0	Monster Maya is Werewolf Maya .
tr	0	His fluid gait reveals a natural athleticism .
tr	0	" Changed my shirt though .
tr	1	He 's like boss of the squirrels .
tr	2	It 's cool . "
tr	1	Same upturned nose and long neck .
tr	1	Rachel must be in class right now .
tr	1	Not being a monster .
tr	2	" But someone did , or something .
tr	4	He nods to the computer screen .
tr	4	Every cell exploding in my veins .
tr	1	Bones shattering like glass .
tr	0	" And heart attacks ? "
tr	1	It 's what they feed off of .
tr	0	But Ryan had such a strong heart .
tr	3	" This map is totally interactive .
tr	2	" Not too easy . "
tr	0	Even Superman had a day job .
tr	0	" Can 't say I blame her .
tr	1	Gabe shrugs like this is obvious .
tr	2	Gabe doesn 't know his favorite color .
tr	2	You should come with .
tr	3	I try to laugh .
tr	2	So many moments open for attack .
tr	1	I pretend like nothing 's wrong .
tr	1	Horribly , terribly , irreparably wrong .
tr	4	I ask to break the silence .
tr	1	" Gun shows . "
tr	0	" God bless ... paranoid Libertarians . "
tr	2	" How can that possibly work ? "
tr	2	He does think it 's cool .
tr	2	Little boy lost in his comic books .
tr	2	No baggage on it . "
tr	1	Shame unfurls in my chest .
tr	3	Not at me or the pictures .
tr	2	No logging into old email accounts .
tr	1	No social media things . "
tr	1	He pauses to lick his lips .
tr	0	I still hate him though .
tr	3	well , it doesn 't matter .
tr	1	I finally break in .
tr	2	Henry holds her hand looking uncomfortable .
tr	4	The tears are dripping off my face .
tr	1	Ryan in a coffin .
tr	0	My hands are shaking .
tr	2	I need to post a confession .
tr	2	It struggles , clawing through my skin .
tr	2	Poor Ryan who loved a monster girl .
tr	0	I push away my nausea .
tr	3	Martha Stewart to the max .
tr	3	It catches in my throat .
tr	1	Pale pink streaks hash across his back .
tr	1	X 's and S 's .
tr	1	The mirror is cracked .
tr	4	My eyes flee away .
tr	2	No books except for one .
tr	1	His head drops ever-so-slightly .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry .
tr	3	I thought ... " I stop .
tr	3	" Everything about it .
tr	1	Refused to carry a gun .
tr	1	" Mom and Tammy and me .
tr	2	" What about school ? "
tr	2	Our mom was a college professor .
tr	1	Gabe smiles again his sad smile .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry . "
tr	1	Discarded shell casings wink in the sun .
tr	1	Fraternal , of course .
tr	0	That was six years ago .
tr	2	Grand was too strong .
tr	2	Could smell you coming a mile away .
tr	3	But Tammy thought this was our chance .
tr	0	I knew it was a trap .
tr	0	Even if it was a trap . "
tr	3	Their phones went straight to voicemail .
tr	2	The towel was soaked in blood .
tr	1	Even skinnier than he is now .
tr	0	All that blood , " Gabe croaks .
tr	0	It was a trap .
tr	3	" Just let him go ? "
tr	2	He didn 't know she was dead .
tr	4	He used to read all the time .
tr	4	All that 's left is vengeance . "
tr	1	Gabe stops and shakes his head .
tr	0	His body quakes with laughter .
tr	1	" It wasn 't funny ! "
tr	0	Or another way to pick at scabs .
tr	2	Things should not come out .
tr	1	Not giving up like Juliette .
tr	3	But I don 't .
tr	1	I stay at his shoulder .
tr	1	Darkness stirred up and tasting sweet .
tr	1	I surprise myself -- I slow down .
tr	1	" You sure ? "
tr	1	" My mother ? "
tr	0	His face is thoughtful .
tr	1	" Of course she was .
tr	1	I lie more than I should .
tr	3	When did she start training them ?
tr	3	What kind of love is that ?
tr	3	I know better than to answer .
tr	1	Pixie Girl is stupid girl .
tr	4	We wanted to save people .
tr	1	Gabe turns his head in my direction .
tr	2	" And how did I turn out ?
tr	1	Anything like you imagined ? "
tr	2	" Kind of a sore point . "
tr	0	" Thanks Gabe . "
tr	1	Is it Grand ? "
tr	2	Looks like an angel .
tr	1	Gabe pauses , swallows .
tr	2	" Good , because I 'm coming .
tr	3	I want to fight . "
tr	3	I get it , " Gabe retorts .
tr	3	I 'm not sure what to expect .
tr	2	" How do you make money ? "
tr	4	He keeps his eyes on the road .
tr	2	" Oh come on .
tr	4	I study those elf eyes .
tr	4	Even those people who hate everything . "
tr	1	It was his kid 's birthday .
tr	0	I shove the hat on my head .
tr	2	" Did you kill the angel ? "
tr	0	" The hell with you both ! "
tr	2	Don 't doubt my mad skills . "
tr	1	" It 's dangerous . "
tr	2	" Border Patrol goes plainclothes ? "
tr	0	He looks back at me , winks .
tr	0	All the playful greens fade away .
tr	2	We stop in front of a door .
tr	0	His words echo again through my mind .
tr	2	My old life is still out there .
tr	2	I try to play Zombie Hordes .
tr	4	There are no lessons learned .
tr	2	The boys don 't come back .
tr	2	One less angel to worry about .
tr	0	I look at Ryan 's face .
tr	1	The door handle turning .
tr	4	" Where 's Gabe ? "
tr	1	" Clipped his wings . "
tr	1	" Killed him , " I say .
tr	2	The Murano smells like blood .
tr	1	" Shut up . "
tr	0	Why do you hate happiness ? "
tr	1	" You guys suck .
tr	0	Gabe lays his head against the window .
tr	2	" Oh Troy ! "
tr	2	" Oh , how wonderful .
tr	1	Gabe puts on his best grin .
tr	3	Well , isn 't that something . "
tr	1	" Who is it ? "
tr	3	" Get out the way . "
tr	2	" We 'll take it slow . "
tr	1	I loosen my fists .
tr	3	Stone lions guard the path .
tr	2	" That booze hound ? "
tr	1	" She 's worthless .
tr	3	And it 's stepmother . "
tr	1	His eyes blink rapidly .
tr	1	I discard the hat and sunglasses .
tr	1	Lo blinks and blinks again .
tr	2	" Oh , no way .
tr	0	He lets out a high-pitched laugh .
tr	4	" You guys are in deep shit .
tr	4	He pulls open a drawer .
tr	1	I 'll be right outside . "
tr	2	Colors puddle on the floor .
tr	1	" I 'm trying .
tr	0	He backs away quickly .
tr	3	I strain to catch the words .
tr	1	She 's strong , " Lo says .
tr	2	You said she only got one shot ?
tr	1	Has she shown any abilities ? "
tr	0	" Angels are human .
tr	2	" How 's it looking ? "
tr	0	That was his whole philosophy in life .
tr	3	Respect goes to the last man standing .
tr	0	I had a very pleasant childhood . "
tr	2	" No you 're not . "
tr	2	Lo looks at me .
tr	0	He thought I was weak .
tr	0	Lo 's voice cracks .
tr	0	Him and all the others . "
tr	1	" Redmond , Washington . "
tr	2	I hate nurses and lollipops and linoleum .
tr	2	Gabe looks up from his laptop .
tr	1	Wan na switch soon ? "
tr	2	" We can grab some food . "
tr	4	" Bags are the best . "
tr	3	I 'll take that one . "
tr	0	She can fight with us . "
tr	0	Gabe clutches the headrest with both hands .
tr	0	look that he was already wearing .
tr	0	" Why not , huh ? "
tr	2	" Why can 't we win ? "
tr	3	I want to kill them both .
tr	2	I yell out for no reason .
tr	4	Like the ocean . "
tr	2	One more monumental apology .
tr	3	I just can 't .
tr	2	I could show the world .
tr	0	" But ... " I manage .
tr	4	" Our parents weighed all the options .
tr	1	It 's only us . "
tr	1	His hands clench into fists .
tr	3	" But that was pretty awesome . "
tr	1	I hum to myself .
tr	1	" Do you really trust her ? "
tr	3	That ain 't much . "
tr	0	A pack of underwear .
tr	0	He already has his laptop out .
tr	0	I already have grandma underwear . "
tr	0	I wave the package at him .
tr	2	We got two bodies .
tr	0	Called it a heart attack .
tr	1	" Bingo , Yahtzee and Connect Four .
tr	3	It 's not a question .
tr	0	Heart attacks all around so far .
tr	1	Gabe turns in his chair and shrugs .
tr	0	" What 's the history here ? "
tr	3	Could just be some heart attacks . "
tr	4	Them 's the rules .
tr	2	You get a look at those bodies .
tr	1	Radiation is confirmation . "
tr	0	" Yeah , " I say again .
tr	2	" You too Maya . "
tr	3	It sounds like a threat .
tr	1	" Bless your precious hearts . "
tr	1	Lots of missing dogs .
tr	3	I step over a twisted root .
tr	1	Gabe and his smiles .
tr	0	Maya and her sighs .
tr	4	" Not ever ? "
tr	1	Ferns reach out and brush my socks .
tr	0	Much like Chuck Norris . "
tr	2	It 's cool . "
tr	2	I do not ponder Chuck Norris .
tr	1	A convenient bloody handprint ?
tr	2	As alone as the hunger will allow .
tr	4	Maybe not a complete monster after all .
tr	2	" I found something too . "
tr	3	" Take this . "
tr	1	I ask , suspicion mounting .
tr	0	" These are pajamas ! "
tr	3	" What about the boys ' section ?
tr	1	" This isn 't funny ! "
tr	2	The lotion burns and reeks of alcohol .
tr	3	I get to stink . "
tr	0	He shakes his head .
tr	3	" Sorry about that .
tr	2	The words don 't come .
tr	2	" About how you found me .
tr	0	" You 've said that already . "
tr	0	It was safer that way .
tr	1	This was big time .
tr	3	" That 's different .
tr	0	" What did she tell him ? "
tr	1	We had nothing , until ... . "
tr	3	" That wasn 't me . "
tr	0	All wearing tank tops .
tr	3	I still have that picture .
tr	0	Gabe laughs a small laugh .
tr	2	You look like Mom .
tr	2	Purple blushes all around him .
tr	2	Mom got that look too .
tr	0	" You had a life .
tr	0	Occasionally his paranoia does pay off . "
tr	1	Gabe 's face is growing suspicious .
tr	4	" We should have done more . "
tr	3	" Shit , " Gabe mutters .
tr	1	" First , it 's raining .
tr	2	" But -- " Gabe begins .
tr	0	They have flashlights and whistles .
tr	2	" How do you do that ? "
tr	1	" No talking . "
tr	2	He doesn 't look up .
tr	2	I 'm too nervous to be quiet .
tr	2	And it 's cold .
tr	3	" You don 't trust me .
tr	1	" End of discussion Maya . "
tr	0	" Maya , no ! "
tr	1	Only it isn 't Ryan .
tr	2	Dead , dead , dead .
tr	2	I hear the sound of footsteps approaching .
tr	4	" You here ? "
tr	1	His flashlight sweeps across the ground .
tr	3	It hits the body and stops .
tr	2	Holy hells , bells , gazelles .
tr	0	" What ... what are you ? "
tr	1	I turn and run .
tr	1	But I hadn 't known before .
tr	1	Gabe 's voice loses its strength .
tr	2	" Alright , " I blubber back .
tr	4	Let us keep you safe . "
tr	1	" Thanks , " he says hoarsely .
tr	2	" Oh , okay . "
tr	0	He had to . "
tr	0	" Aw man , " Gabe says .
tr	1	I wait for him to continue .
tr	0	" What idea ? "
tr	1	Gabe tucks his face into his pillow .
tr	1	His voice is muffled .
tr	0	" Was I in a lake ? "
tr	1	Grand 's fingers trailing down my back .
tr	1	Finding what they will find .
tr	0	" Oh , hey .
tr	1	A muffled " fuck . "
tr	1	" Shut up . "
tr	2	" You 're on Facebook !
tr	1	" I have a girlfriend . "
tr	4	Then there are the nymph twins .
tr	0	" Ah , Francesca .
tr	1	I laugh , but it sounds forced .
tr	1	" Wind resistance , " he says .
tr	3	Just love those little guys .
tr	0	I want a montage . "
tr	0	" Wild huh ? "
tr	1	Did I kill you ? "
tr	2	" Oh , wonderful !
tr	0	" Oh , right .
tr	4	Did she take them all ? "
tr	2	His voice is smooth and low .
tr	2	You understand ... Good , good .
tr	1	Anything you can tell me .
tr	2	You 're doing good .
tr	2	And finally , " I will .
tr	2	And God bless you too . "
tr	2	Hispanic woman , drove an old Corolla .
tr	1	That 's changing now .
tr	1	An Indian reservation in Nevada .
tr	1	Let 's say 150 - 180 pounds .
tr	3	" Stop it . "
tr	0	Said she had a farm .
tr	1	" It 's almost sun down .
tr	2	" Of course I do .
tr	3	Point and pull the trigger . "
tr	0	Gabe clears his throat .
tr	3	We 're trying to protect you . "
tr	1	This isn 't a good life . "
tr	2	" Still mad ? "
tr	0	" We are Maya . "
tr	0	" Maya , I know .
tr	1	Ryan in a coffin .
tr	3	Don 't let that happen .
tr	0	Please , Maya . "
tr	0	That means he 's family now . "
tr	0	" Okay , Gabe .
tr	1	I 'm pissed at him right now .
tr	1	" I think she likes you . "
tr	2	" Are you two done ? "
tr	2	Well , mostly to Gabe .
tr	1	A girl could get curious .
tr	0	I draw a halo over the wings .
tr	3	It 's large , but not ostentatious .
tr	1	I hear their voices whispering .
tr	1	" This is his office .
tr	0	" He 's human . "
tr	1	" Who is it ? "
tr	4	Who 's been infected ? "
tr	1	Incredible isn 't it ?
tr	1	" Who is it ? "
tr	2	" It 's still a jungle .
tr	3	" Yes , and that is unfortunate .
tr	4	Then again , people die every day .
tr	0	A crazy laugh itches in my throat .
tr	1	He spreads his hands on the desk .
tr	3	" It went out the window .
tr	4	" You keep strange company . "
tr	1	" I 'm fine . "
tr	0	" He 's human . "
tr	0	" Take Maya with you .
tr	1	Nothing snaps inside of me .
tr	2	Poor little angel girl .
tr	0	Ryan always accused me of being overdramatic .
tr	4	My new memory serves me well .
tr	1	The rain is a faint mist .
tr	2	" Hey , " I call .
tr	2	" Not for me . "
tr	2	I look up at her .
tr	3	I just want to talk . " '
tr	3	" I do want to talk . "
tr	0	" I killed Amanda .
tr	2	I told her not to come over .
tr	0	Amanda came over anyway .
tr	2	I 'll just keep killing . "
tr	2	" You can control it . "
tr	1	" No , I tried . "
tr	3	Her hands fold into tight fists .
tr	1	The girl gives me an appraising look .
tr	2	" No you don 't .
tr	2	You 're muddled . "
tr	4	She 's fed recently .
tr	1	Gray like smoke , " she says .
tr	3	" That 's not true . "
tr	1	My voice sounds weak , unconvincing .
tr	1	" We 're stronger and smarter .
tr	0	Ask me anything about the Civil War .
tr	1	" There 's also this . "
tr	2	Flip open a book .
tr	1	Toss a tennis ball across the room .
tr	1	Pick up heavier things . "
tr	4	" The killing gets easier too . "
tr	0	Amber takes a step forward .
tr	3	There was a cop tonight .
tr	0	He probably had a family .
tr	0	I think about Amanda all day .
tr	3	I don 't know about that .
tr	1	I 'm terrified and giggly .
tr	3	I try to snatch a breath .
tr	3	This time the night blinks out .
tr	2	Almost out of air .
tr	1	My hands drop away from her wrist .
tr	0	A hiss and the rain starts again .
tr	4	The fingers on my neck relax .
tr	3	Thoughts percolating but unfinished .
tr	2	A voice calls below .
tr	1	" Is it raining again ? "
tr	1	" I think it 's hers .
tr	2	Did you hit your head ? "
tr	2	" Of course not .
tr	1	Doesn 't he think this is funny ?
tr	3	I take note of this slight shift .
tr	2	" What now ? "
tr	1	" I bury her . "
tr	3	" Don 't worry about that .
tr	3	I try to swallow then stop trying .
tr	4	" You were unarmed .
tr	0	It was a long time ago . "
tr	2	" How could he know ? "
tr	0	You had something valuable to trade .
tr	3	About the birthmark . "
tr	2	Defend what you did ! "
tr	1	I 'm not angry .
tr	1	Can 't understand anything about him .
tr	4	He wrestles it down again .
tr	2	I open the door of the SUV .
tr	0	" Thank you , " he whispers .
tr	2	" I 'll teach you . "
tr	1	Burdens enough for us all .
tr	1	My brothers return together three hours later .
tr	1	" I guess . "
tr	2	Gabe walks to our door .
tr	1	I 'm twitching harder now .
tr	2	" Why do you do it ? "
tr	1	Gabe turns his head in my direction .
tr	0	All the angels are back to normal .
tr	1	You didn 't even know him . "
tr	3	I can 't let that happen .
tr	1	His voice is rising .
tr	3	It didn 't take long . "
tr	3	Sitting at the desk .
tr	1	Tapping , tapping , tapping my fingers .
tr	1	Concentrate on him and his vanilla scents .
tr	4	I need to write something .
tr	3	But tonight I need distraction .
tr	2	I 'm so close to breaking .
tr	4	Keep holding myself back .
tr	1	I 'm not evil .
tr	1	He smells like soap and shampoo .
tr	0	" Maya , take my hand . "
tr	2	I won 't let you fall . "
tr	4	This means there 's hope .
tr	4	There 's no time for rest .
tr	2	" How far out ? "
tr	1	He turns and unzips .
tr	1	I can 't squelch my surprise .
tr	1	My brothers arm up .
tr	2	Too fucking bad for him .
tr	1	In the barn . "
tr	1	" Shit , " Gabe whispers .
tr	3	The two men stroll toward the barn .
tr	1	My skin breaks out in goose bumps .
tr	1	It 's fine . "
tr	2	" How ' bout you hero boy ?
tr	1	You wan na save your new friends ?
tr	1	Step on up . "
tr	3	But it isn 't just their bodies .
tr	0	" A farm , " he says .
tr	0	" It 's a human farm . "
tr	0	Nathaniel is actually wearing a black cape .
tr	3	Not all of them are incredibly attractive .
tr	2	I look down at my cell phone .
tr	0	Nathaniel waves a pale hand in disgust .
tr	0	He waves a hand .
tr	0	It is the Macarena .
tr	1	He stares at it , obviously confused .
tr	3	Two things hit me .
tr	1	It is pitch-black night outside .
tr	0	" Are you all packed ? "
tr	1	' Ts gon na be fun . "
tr	1	I 'm coming with you . "
tr	3	How about that weather ? "
tr	1	This is everything I own .
tr	4	Want some coffee too , Helen ?
tr	1	Taylor was all business now .
tr	1	" We will be in unfamiliar terrain .
tr	1	Ms. Spade this goes especially for you .
tr	2	After that you are on your own .
tr	2	Good luck to all of us . "
tr	0	Any activity in the area ? "
tr	2	Good luck , John ! "
tr	0	Chapter 2 : War , What War ?
tr	2	Contact DHS for more information . "
tr	1	I 've had it .
tr	4	Use the satellite phones for all communications .
tr	4	Seconds later the alarms went off . "
tr	2	" You can call off the dogs .
tr	0	He hung up without another word .
tr	2	The dominoes fell slowly .
tr	1	Faith is a wonderful thing .
tr	3	Now she had their attention .
tr	0	What a feeling to be flying again .
tr	0	' Who would have thought ?
tr	2	Taylor did not mind .
tr	2	" I 'll be d. ... ! "
tr	1	I was sick to my stomach .
tr	2	Life was good for right now .
tr	3	" What is the most important thing ?
tr	3	I would not trust her .
tr	2	Lilly Ann asked the girl .
tr	2	Lilly Ann asked very seriously .
tr	1	" It is a bit complicated .
tr	2	Lilly Ann replied lightly .
tr	2	Lilly Ann simply asked .
tr	4	Wonder what they use for fuel . "
tr	3	Taylor chased Hunt up the street laughing .
tr	1	" Here it is again .
tr	2	Now Taylor heard it too .
tr	1	" That 's impossible ! "
tr	3	they started to stutter at once .
tr	2	" Hold on to your mama ! "
tr	2	" Who saved room for desert ? "
tr	1	Lilly Ann surprised her guests .
tr	2	" I 'll burst ! "
tr	0	" What are we having ? "
tr	3	Chapter 5 : Bounty !
tr	1	Terribly selfish , isn 't it ? "
tr	1	Frank wanted to know .
tr	2	he asked out of curiosity .
tr	2	" Lilly Ann ? "
tr	1	His optimism was intoxicating .
tr	1	Now Lilly Ann was getting excited .
tr	1	There was no warning .
tr	1	( unknown author ) . "
tr	3	He just could not stop to talk .
tr	0	Jack and Joe Jack were artists .
tr	2	It was a big one too .
tr	4	Where am I ? "
tr	1	This is my house . "
tr	4	Yep , all there .
tr	2	I 'll leave you two alone .
tr	1	Taylor frowned at her .
tr	1	Are my friends all right ?
tr	0	Panic began to spread through his thoughts .
tr	3	Not much to it really . "
tr	2	he asked Lilly Ann .
tr	2	she ran out of the room .
tr	3	" That 's it ! "
tr	2	Lilly Ann followed his example .
tr	2	was all Taylor could get out .
tr	1	" Town reporter ? "
tr	3	With that she ran out the door .
tr	1	" This is so funny ! "
tr	2	Lilly Ann pulled the chair closer .
tr	1	This is how the universe works .
tr	1	This always goes both ways . "
tr	0	What about my plane crash ?
tr	3	" But what about my legs ? "
tr	3	Let 's think silly together .
tr	3	Isn 't that great ? "
tr	2	I would be lying to myself . "
tr	3	That 's what they do .
tr	2	" Who did all these drawings ? "
tr	2	Is that for Lilly Ann F. ? "
tr	1	' I love grass .
tr	2	I love the hills .
tr	1	And on and on he goes .
tr	2	I really learned a lot from him .
tr	2	How did you find them ?
tr	1	Now let 's play something fun . "
tr	0	What are we playing ? "
tr	1	Can I go next ? "
tr	1	And on and on we 'd go .
tr	2	The room was quiet for a moment .
tr	3	No one but Taylor , that is .
tr	4	The little house grew quiet .
tr	0	She put her hands firmly on them .
tr	4	Can you feel them ? "
tr	2	" You are one of us now .
tr	2	And so he tried and it worked .
tr	2	She got up from the floor ceremoniously .
tr	2	Are you coming ? "
tr	2	And so they did .
tr	3	Isn 't this neat ? "
tr	3	At least she was consistent about that .
tr	1	" Is this a school ? "
tr	0	His name was Abraham . "
tr	0	There was no doubt Abraham spoke .
tr	1	Sounds silly , doesn 't it ?
tr	3	Nothing that you want is upstream . "
tr	1	The activity around him was electrifying .
tr	3	" But what about other things ? "
tr	1	" And this works ? "
tr	2	Taylor smiled and nodded his head .
tr	2	" More of what ? "
tr	1	Simple , isn 't it ? "
tr	3	Taylor didn 't know what to believe .
tr	2	or ' What do you mean ? '
tr	2	Taylor replied on many occasions .
tr	3	All three burst out into laughter .
tr	2	Then you both lose out .
tr	1	Lilly Ann continued to ask .
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	2	Sounds like a lot of fun . "
tr	3	" What 's wrong with that ? "
tr	3	Isn 't that normal ? "
tr	2	So , you choose again .
tr	2	Are you Geronimo ? "
tr	2	Lilly Ann got her game rolling .
tr	0	" Ask what ? "
tr	2	" Who told ? "
tr	3	Taylor promptly walked straight in .
tr	1	" Wan na know ? "
tr	0	" Orange , " she said finally .
tr	1	" Sorry I missed you .
tr	2	Lilly Ann pulled on Taylor 's arm .
tr	3	It doesn 't get better that this .
tr	4	" I 've seen that . "
tr	2	Lilly Ann was curious .
tr	3	Taylor was getting a little worried .
tr	0	Taylor was afraid of the answer .
tr	3	Tom was not quite sure .
tr	0	" A sign for what ? "
tr	1	I like it . "
tr	2	" You really like it ? "
tr	3	" Tried to tell me what ? "
tr	3	It was just the way things were .
tr	3	What did you put in there ? "
tr	0	, " Fritz chuckled .
tr	2	" How 'd you know ? "
tr	0	He laughed and shook his head .
tr	1	Willie teased with his broad boyish grin .
tr	0	" What was that all about ? "
tr	2	Come on , let 's go . "
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	3	Next time it 's my turn . "
tr	3	Isn 't that exciting ? "
tr	1	Taylor did not give in so easily .
tr	1	Wan na join us ?
tr	0	You are healthy and strong .
tr	1	You have a wonderful family surrounding you .
tr	0	They both laughed knowingly .
tr	0	I was fully aware of it .
tr	3	Isn 't that beautiful ? "
tr	0	" Thought , huh ? "
tr	0	How far can you reach ?
tr	1	It 's delicious . "
tr	3	That sort of stuff . "
tr	1	Lilly Ann asked innocently .
tr	0	Four days later the captain was back .
tr	1	' I can build this . '
tr	2	Do you work in metal too ? "
tr	1	she smiled at him warmly .
tr	2	Lilly Ann was curious .
tr	2	" Behold the Condor . "
tr	3	It didn 't look pretty .
tr	2	And so they did .
tr	2	She flew for good .
tr	0	She 's a good airplane . "
tr	2	It 's so good . "
tr	1	Sounds simple enough , right ? "
tr	2	Would it still be simple ?
tr	1	It 's in the pudding .
tr	2	" Did she ? "
tr	1	" Guess what ? "
tr	3	Taylor tried to change the subject .
tr	4	You 've talked with her before . "
tr	2	Lilly Ann was skeptical .
tr	2	I got by good enough . "
tr	2	Taylor nodded his head .
tr	0	Always a great help . "
tr	3	Taylor didn 't know what to think .
tr	3	He just could not help it .
tr	2	Thank you for your support .
tr	2	He had stopped dead in his tracks .
tr	0	, then I had an idea .
tr	3	Then the interview started to go downhill .
tr	0	Natasha was obviously up and about .
tr	1	' Point taken ' I said .
tr	1	They went a funny colour .
tr	2	' How do you know that ? '
tr	0	A ' boat ' is a submarine .
tr	2	Do you agree to this ? '
tr	4	' Whatever happened to the suit ? '
tr	0	Oh yes , HRH .
tr	3	It took her ten days .
tr	0	' They play cards Graham ' .
tr	0	( Farnborough alternates annually with Paris ) .
tr	0	The war had now escalated .
tr	4	There was complete and utter silence .
tr	0	' Have I made a mistake ? '
tr	0	Then I had an idea .
tr	0	That 's an odd name . '
tr	1	Now about those remaining twenty winks ?
tr	2	' Do you like oils ?
tr	1	( messy ) , watercolours ?
tr	1	( runny ) , etching ?
tr	1	( later dear ) , reproductions ?
tr	0	What 's a void ? )
tr	2	' Will you ... . '
tr	2	Can something like Wall really happen ?
tr	3	Time you got over that cunt .
tr	4	Her struggling increased as I moved closer .
tr	4	" Where are they ? "
tr	1	I cut her off .
tr	1	She said , " Sure . "
tr	2	It sounded good but just too utopian .
tr	4	Connie came up with one that worked .
tr	2	'll mean a lot to me . "
tr	1	I apologize I had it all wrong .
tr	2	You look like you got butterflies . "
tr	2	He chuckled , " Just kidding .
tr	1	Our gun was still firing .
tr	1	Jim we still got communications ? "
tr	2	Don 't forget your the CO. .
tr	4	Now are there any questions ?
tr	3	Dan I 'll start with you . "
tr	1	I said , " Certainly Linda .
tr	1	Have any questions or concerns ?
tr	2	I 'll tell you why .
tr	1	I called my first crisis meeting .
tr	1	" Yes Sir . "
tr	1	Next morning I sent for Herb .
tr	4	Have a cup of coffee instead . "
tr	2	One young man stood up .
tr	1	Connie piped up , " Two . "
tr	2	" One of your girls . "
tr	1	Dennis quickly went to work .
tr	1	I asked Dennis how things had gone .
tr	1	I said , " I agree . "
tr	2	Do you feel comfortable doing this ? "
tr	1	I said , " Certainly Herb . "
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	4	Then her eyes closed .
tr	1	I was in limbo waiting for news .
tr	1	" Linda what is it ? "
tr	3	We sat in the cockpit .
tr	2	I 'll level with you .
tr	0	As usual Allan had the last word .
tr	1	Connie was first to speak .
tr	0	Can she really do that ?
tr	1	Tolerance has many definitions and meanings .
tr	2	Stop promoting ethanol made from food crops .
tr	3	OK , great but what niche ?
tr	4	She is neither malevolent nor benevolent .
tr	3	but that was over twenty years ago .
tr	0	particularly Gema ... ... .
tr	2	He is too proud ... ... . .
tr	0	Gema always leading the way ... . .
tr	0	a normal day ... . .
tr	4	The visitors continued their quiet orderly advance .
tr	1	said Jennings standing up .
tr	0	What an enigma she was .
tr	2	Mason thought about George Mudd .
tr	0	Wan na cuppa ? "
tr	2	Mason took a sip of his tea .
tr	1	Usual stuff ... . .
tr	2	Mason took another sip of his tea .
tr	2	We 'll establish an alternative LZ .
tr	0	by the way ... . .
tr	3	I 'll get to it later .
tr	2	She looked up more composed now .
tr	1	He sat at his desk .
tr	1	or is it ? "
tr	1	" Morning Dickie ... .
tr	3	Gurney started to laugh .
tr	2	Bye for now . "
tr	3	" So what 's the verdict ? "
tr	3	retorted the Captain sounding irritated .
tr	2	" Well sir ... .
tr	2	then take a real good look around .
tr	2	Sound OK to you sir ? "
tr	2	" You know ... .
tr	3	but not on the beach . "
tr	1	no sign ... . .
tr	1	The jungle is my friend and companion .
tr	0	He was at least a head taller .
tr	1	" I think we found it sir .
tr	2	You should know how I feel .
tr	3	no more than that . "
tr	3	but that was it .
tr	0	Wilkinson came back from the cockpit .
tr	2	shouted Mudd over the din .
tr	4	The sudden jerk of arrested movement .
tr	2	" All done ... . .
tr	3	two getting some kip ... . .
tr	2	two on two off ? "
tr	1	no fucking snoring ! "
tr	2	stretched out on his poncho ... . .
tr	0	then again ... ... brass ... .
tr	1	Harry had already returned .
tr	0	" Holy shit ! "
tr	4	The house didn 't answer .
tr	4	" Where the hell 's Gema ?
tr	1	she 's usually home by now . "
tr	2	So he 'd looked for work .
tr	1	" Dickie ... . .
tr	2	Wendy was starting to look worried .
tr	3	They could trust him with their lives .
tr	2	Gema nodded her understanding .
tr	0	Gema smiled at the military jargon .
tr	1	This will be hard going now .
tr	2	still dark brown and oily .
tr	4	The jungle had done its job .
tr	2	" I 'm looking for a grave .
tr	3	this might be my parents . "
tr	0	" Ada yang tahu .
tr	4	She 'd only just made it here .
tr	3	Too quickly it was time to leave .
tr	1	This golf course was his home course .
tr	1	just around the corner really ... ... .
tr	4	" Hey George ... .
tr	2	" What you whispering about Trooper ? "
tr	1	So how 's the business George ?
tr	4	George mulled this over for a minute .
tr	1	" You know you 're right Harry .
tr	2	People not knowing what to say .
tr	1	Shopping list on the fridge .
tr	3	it 's just there ... . .
tr	4	Here he was in his element .
tr	1	Harry interrupted his daydreaming .
tr	2	Course he shouldn 't complain .
tr	4	He drew contentedly on his cigar .
tr	1	Run for Heart . "
tr	3	what 's that ? "
tr	1	When is it ? "
tr	3	Is that from the golf club ? "
tr	0	" You playing ? "
tr	2	" So who 's playing who ? "
tr	1	Ron Gurney walked in .
tr	2	So where are you from Tony ? "
tr	4	asked George , curious .
tr	4	" Where you from George ? '
tr	2	" Visitors have the honor Tony . "
tr	1	just a couple of minutes .
tr	4	She asked for guidance .
tr	0	In the shower she thought about him .
tr	0	He was a wise man .
tr	4	The miles clicked off steadily ... . .
tr	2	" Can you handle four more ? "
tr	0	" What the hell for ? "
tr	0	" How appropriate , " he thought .
tr	4	The smartly dressed gentleman keyed his mike .
tr	4	~ ~ ~ Chapter 10 The Reunion .
tr	0	" What are your chaps wearing ? "
tr	0	She 'd cut her hair short ... .
tr	4	couple of laugh lines round her eyes .
tr	1	Her skin was still unblemished .
tr	0	You ready yet ? "
tr	2	All those years of doubt ... ... .
tr	1	of not knowing and they knew .
tr	1	Not perhaps ... . .
tr	2	Control ... ... control .
tr	1	The crowd swirled around her .
tr	2	" Is everyone playing golf tomorrow ? "
tr	4	The noise level increased ... . .
tr	4	He 'd seen him before .
tr	2	Avi nodded his head .
tr	1	I will give you a price .
tr	2	asked the Commander and David 's boss .
tr	3	OK let 's get on with it .
tr	0	What more can a man want ? "
tr	2	" How come ? "
tr	2	" What now ? "
tr	0	" Who is he though ? "
tr	3	" That 's Sergeant to you constable .
tr	2	She waved David down the hill .
tr	4	She turned back to the bunker .
tr	4	" How did he get here ? "
tr	1	As for identification , nothing yet .
tr	1	She 's pretty shook up .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	0	I was in Malaya and Borneo .
tr	3	My contacts are pretty good .
tr	4	He looked at the items .
tr	1	Purely coincidental was the consensus of opinion .
tr	0	By the way ... ... .
tr	1	As for Jennings I 've no idea .
tr	4	Jennie looked round the tastefully decorated room .
tr	4	He looked at her seriously .
tr	4	" There is ? "
tr	3	that 's what it does . "
tr	2	" How did you find Mudd ? "
tr	1	McElroy works for George Mudd in Brunei .
tr	2	He was like a Colonel Blimp .
tr	3	but we got it eventually .
tr	1	Another connection ... ... . .
tr	3	* It started to rain .
tr	4	as though she were somewhere else .
tr	4	she said seemingly alarmed .
tr	0	it was a spectacular room .
tr	4	Can you get out here ?
tr	1	The different jurisdictions work on their own .
tr	3	His thoughts turned to Gema .
tr	0	It was almost dark .
tr	0	he thought to himself .
tr	2	the God of War of the Iban .
tr	4	" Hear me my Father .
tr	2	He is tough and obviously very focused .
tr	2	" Do you shoot ? "
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	1	" No business today . "
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	0	" Want the same Frank ? "
tr	3	You going to stay the night here ?
tr	0	" OK Frank ... . .
tr	4	Make sure he gets all the information .
tr	1	I 'm sure this is different . "
tr	4	I already knew you were qualified . "
tr	4	Jennie looked a little peeved .
tr	2	" Don 't blame David Jen .
tr	2	" Kick your shoes off ... . .
tr	0	too damn big anyway .
tr	1	His mobile vibrated in his pocket .
tr	0	she was familiar now .
tr	1	He smiled grimly his face turning hard .
tr	1	like I said a traditionalist .
tr	1	She 's smart and she 's tough .
tr	3	bit of a mystery that ... ... .
tr	3	Even took it to the UN .
tr	3	Waste of bloody time that .
tr	2	" So who are you ? "
tr	0	" What about Mrs. Mason ? "
tr	1	" No Miss ... .
tr	3	She was quite emphatic about it .
tr	1	eight for sure I think .
tr	2	Good enough crowd for dinner . "
tr	2	* It was bloody cold .
tr	2	the old control tower .
tr	2	all closed for the night .
tr	2	half an hour to go .
tr	2	Everybody should be in position by now .
tr	4	The entire exercise took seven minutes !
tr	4	The Commander was reading the inventory report .
tr	4	now there 's a coincidence ! "
tr	2	someone to chat to .
tr	1	Not so this evening .
tr	1	No neighbors or anything .
tr	0	milk and sugar ? "
tr	3	The room now was getting quite warm .
tr	1	" Has he passed out ?
tr	2	" Good show ... .
tr	2	His mind twisted and turned .
tr	1	Patience was his only friend just now .
tr	1	he no longer felt anything .
tr	2	" You following protocol ? "
tr	4	The Commander chipped in .
tr	1	The problem is in London and Ireland .
tr	3	just the six of them . "
tr	2	You and David should do the interview .
tr	1	wait for my command . "
tr	4	three of us . "
tr	0	how naughty ... ... ... .
tr	4	so what have we got here ? "
tr	2	" Oh boy ... .
tr	1	still in their packing grease .
tr	2	obviously payment for the guns .
tr	2	we 'll keep on looking though .
tr	0	a refuge ... ... a cave almost .
tr	0	" What are you laughing at ? "
tr	1	just help yourself to drinks . "
tr	1	He won 't say anything .
tr	2	no matter for how long .
tr	1	and I mean anything .
tr	2	and of course he has you now .
tr	0	The day was drawing to a close .
tr	0	He passed Robbie a small package .
tr	4	George ripped the paper off .
tr	0	" A trap machine !
tr	0	what a wonderful idea . "
tr	1	he says it 's urgent . "
tr	2	" What do you think Robbie ? "
tr	2	" Mine too ... ... .
tr	2	lots to do today .
tr	2	you look great this morning .
tr	3	I trust them both implicitly . "
tr	4	" Well I never ... ... .
tr	3	Mother and daughter walked into the study .
tr	1	or rather her mother 's heritage .
tr	4	" Yes but they 're cold .
tr	2	" Robbie ... . .
tr	1	" Jimmy ... ... .
tr	2	no way of telling really .
tr	0	It 's a woman ... ... .
tr	3	" Sure got that itchy feeling . "
tr	2	again on the golf course . "
tr	3	Got ta get one ... ... .
tr	1	it 's terrific . "
tr	3	got ta get one . "
tr	2	He looked at Tony .
tr	3	Other than that everything is fine . "
tr	4	lot easier when she 's here !
tr	0	No that was more of a jangle .
tr	1	He was dressed in his dress blues .
tr	2	Hours spent on the golf course .
tr	4	His thoughts were broken by Jennie .
tr	3	How empty must the future look ?
tr	2	we should hear something soon . "
tr	3	" Terry was attacked in the woods .
tr	4	never heard a bloody thing .
tr	2	We know zip ! "
tr	3	The ticket was bought by you . "
tr	4	" Robbie McElroy please . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry Miss Mason .
tr	4	You seem quieter now ... ... . .
tr	4	It was summer there ... ... .
tr	1	" Ask your questions then . "
tr	0	" Jennings was also in Sarawak .
tr	4	" Where 's Wendy ? "
tr	2	" Do you know Tony Wei ? "
tr	2	David stood up and stretched his back .
tr	1	His phone vibrated in his pocket .
tr	4	he asked the uniform .
tr	2	Two slowly moving fans moved the air .
tr	0	She was still a beautiful woman .
tr	2	I 'll tell you about it later .
tr	1	" I could do with something different .
tr	2	We 'll stay in the lowlands .
tr	0	Gema Mason was from that village .
tr	0	Anyone have any ideas ?
tr	1	Anyone want another drink ?
tr	2	Good put him on . "
tr	1	She 's still in Bandar he thinks .
tr	3	Her mind went back to the photo .
tr	0	He was a wise man !
tr	4	" Identify yourselves please . "
tr	2	Nod your head if you understand . "
tr	1	Happy to be alive I think .
tr	0	It was already getting dark .
tr	4	The house is isolated and quiet .
tr	2	Nod your head if you understand . "
tr	2	Tony nodded his head .
tr	1	It will explain everything .
tr	1	Jesus ... what 's going on ? "
tr	2	" Yea we could do that Rob .
tr	2	They set off the following morning .
tr	1	His arm hung useless at his side .
tr	2	The motivation for this book .
tr	0	My children I love you guys .
tr	0	I never saw such a big man .
tr	0	An impossible dream for any hardened sailor .
tr	1	Cisco sighed and closed his eyes .
tr	0	A sway he hardly noticed anymore .
tr	1	He is within his rights of course .
tr	0	I am just a sailor .
tr	1	I can offer her nothing .
tr	1	But I do miss him .
tr	1	I saw some of the slaves today .
tr	0	Her name is Kayla .
tr	0	I am a married woman .
tr	1	She spoke with Cisco .
tr	3	I cannot take that .
tr	0	The Captain was not pleased .
tr	2	For the love of a sailor .
tr	3	But I could not talk to her .
tr	3	The Captain worked Cisco almost to death .
tr	2	How could Faro do this to me ?
tr	3	Tired , thirsty and lonely .
tr	2	It is all my fault .
tr	3	That was all there was to it .
tr	3	It was short but worth it .
tr	1	I simply had to see him .
tr	3	How could they treat him like that ?
tr	0	What a beautiful name .
tr	4	Every eye was on us .
tr	0	I saw Kayla again , briefly .
tr	0	The captain flogged Cisco like an animal .
tr	2	He had to be unconscious .
tr	3	But at least Cisco is better .
tr	1	I know I love him .
tr	1	Cisco is willing to learn .
tr	0	I can hardly wait .
tr	4	What can be so terrible ?
tr	0	" Are you well , Captain ? "
tr	1	I am use to hardships .
tr	2	Don 't worry about me . "
tr	1	" Jean what is going on ?
tr	2	The captain is wounded , look ! "
tr	0	" What about Pedro and pirates ? "
tr	1	Consider this a business transaction .
tr	1	His life is in your hands .
tr	2	" We leave tomorrow morning at six .
tr	4	Be there or bear the consequences . "
tr	2	" How dare you ? "
tr	4	And he left her standing there .
tr	3	But after yesterday it was true .
tr	3	The greatest gift of all .
tr	4	You bless the pure in heart .
tr	1	This is all thanks to Cisco .
tr	0	They would always stay in my mind .
tr	0	Again she was filled with outrage .
tr	2	I will give them hell .
tr	2	For now I will play along .
tr	1	I will go and get him ! "
tr	3	He had to tend to the farm .
tr	1	I will be fine .
tr	2	I will be all right .
tr	1	She said with much conviction .
tr	2	" No , mother . "
tr	4	She allowed them to run freely .
tr	0	She is my joy , my delight .
tr	2	I will love her always .
tr	3	People scrambled to get to it first .
tr	0	He was a cruel man .
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	3	" That is correct .
tr	2	Did you change your mind ? "
tr	0	She could physically harm him by now .
tr	0	" You are a bastard ! "
tr	4	Pierre , his second-in-command , asked .
tr	0	She is a real wildcat .
tr	1	My first impressions of her were correct .
tr	2	What a wonderful , brilliant child .
tr	0	What a fool I was .
tr	2	he asked without looking up .
tr	0	He had to hand it to her .
tr	0	Ahh , the thorns , he smiled .
tr	3	She would not accept this .
tr	1	Tears of frustration ran down her cheeks .
tr	2	She was looking forlorn .
tr	0	" Yes , thank you . "
tr	3	Not a very pretty picture .
tr	3	But that cost her dearly .
tr	2	And when opportunity knocked he took it .
tr	1	Darkness filled the starry night sky .
tr	1	I miss him awfully .
tr	1	I miss both my parents . "
tr	3	Thanks for the story . "
tr	0	I am a father now .
tr	0	How fortunate and happy I am .
tr	0	May I walk around ? "
tr	1	Thanks for warning us . "
tr	2	" Good , then .
tr	1	" How did I miss one ? "
tr	0	" Yes , Captain . "
tr	3	Roberto gritted his teeth .
tr	4	Pierre let him be .
tr	4	It did not make sense .
tr	4	" We are entering dangerous waters .
tr	0	He knew that much .
tr	1	His men were his responsibility .
tr	3	" And the storm ? "
tr	2	Who will go with us ? "
tr	1	No point in arguing .
tr	4	Yes , he knew Falcon .
tr	0	He was as bad as they came .
tr	2	No one had moved .
tr	2	It does not add up . "
tr	1	and Pierre raised a brow .
tr	1	So many blessings to be grateful for .
tr	1	The medicine woman confirmed my suspicions today .
tr	0	What a beautiful , handsome boy .
tr	1	Cisco is teaching him everything he knows .
tr	1	Cisco fills my days with happiness .
tr	2	His body demanded attention .
tr	3	Her head wanted to split in two .
tr	1	" No , dammit !
tr	2	She could do nothing for him .
tr	0	But she was a woman .
tr	1	This could simply not happen .
tr	2	" How do you know this ? "
tr	2	" They are looking for someone .
tr	1	Was their captain out of his mind ?
tr	3	" Get started . "
tr	4	The law of the sea requires this .
tr	0	" Captain , wait .
tr	1	Pierre interrupted , touching his arm .
tr	2	Roberto , you cannot flog this woman !
tr	3	At first he did not want to .
tr	1	Faro has paid for his sins .
tr	0	What kind of a man was he ?
tr	1	No anger , no humiliation .
tr	2	She could not hate Roberto .
tr	4	She felt at home .
tr	2	His features looked sullen but still blank .
tr	1	" My brother will understand .
tr	1	Roberto grinned , his anger forgotten .
tr	4	She is beautiful when angry .
tr	3	" Not much to tell .
tr	0	It was a long time ago .
tr	4	This can never be . "
tr	1	Pushing him aside , she stood up .
tr	0	What was that all about ?
tr	0	It was unheard of .
tr	0	" Yes , thank you .
tr	0	This they had to hear .
tr	1	She shrugged her shoulders casually .
tr	2	" Now wait , Roberto .
tr	0	That sounds like a great plan . "
tr	2	Her logic was too simple for him .
tr	4	" Yes , clear . "
tr	0	" Yeah right . "
tr	2	So many things could go wrong .
tr	0	Thoughts rushed through him .
tr	2	She is not married to you .
tr	1	He squirmed in his chair .
tr	0	She was hiding behind the bravado .
tr	0	he thought his face in a scowl .
tr	0	Each man knew what to do .
tr	1	Please hurry , Roberto .
tr	0	She chuckled with delight .
tr	0	" Thank you Captain . "
tr	3	It is of the utmost importance . "
tr	0	" Thank you , Captain .
tr	2	Roberto looked at her with curiosity .
tr	0	" Yeah right . "
tr	2	So many things could go wrong .
tr	4	One he had never encountered before .
tr	0	Thoughts rushed through him .
tr	2	She is not married to you .
tr	1	He squirmed in his chair .
tr	0	She was hiding behind the bravado .
tr	0	he thought his face in a scowl .
tr	0	Each man knew what to do .
tr	1	Please hurry , Roberto .
tr	0	She chuckled with delight .
tr	0	" Thank you Captain . "
tr	3	It is of the utmost importance . "
tr	0	" Thank you , Captain .
tr	2	Roberto looked at her with curiosity .
tr	4	She intrigued him more and more .
tr	1	He would laugh about it .
tr	1	The image imprinted in her mind .
tr	2	He meant to travel alone on foot .
tr	1	the men asked in confusion .
tr	1	" It is all right .
tr	1	She flinched , still unconscious .
tr	0	" It is manageable .
tr	2	" How do you feel ? "
tr	4	How will I ever repay you ? "
tr	1	How was this possible ?
tr	1	Roberto rushed over to her .
tr	0	This was not a dream .
tr	2	" I love you . "
tr	4	She felt safe in his presence .
tr	4	Leave me alone ! "
tr	1	she screamed , struggling in his hold .
tr	1	His voice was stern and cold .
tr	0	He was arrogant and defiant .
tr	0	" Bastard , lock him up ! "
tr	2	" I will always protect you . "
tr	0	She gasped with delight and shock .
tr	0	Did she hear right ?
tr	0	She had hardly slept last night .
tr	2	You are too precious to me .
tr	3	But this was important to her .
tr	1	She looked at him in dismay .
tr	2	" How , Roberto ? "
tr	1	" Does this means yes ? "
tr	0	" You already talked to him ? "
tr	0	" Your captain cannot save you .
tr	4	You are mine , " he seethed .
tr	0	She pushed him away .
tr	4	Finally he placed her underneath the covers .
tr	2	I do not blame you . "
tr	1	" Nothing can happen to me .
tr	3	That was all that mattered .
tr	0	" Yes , Captain . "
tr	0	" Yes , Captain . "
tr	2	Dark colours covered the bed and windows .
tr	0	No papers lay around .
tr	1	I don 't want to change anything .
tr	2	Your love for books astounds me . "
tr	0	She chuckled with a blush .
tr	0	" I was so afraid . "
tr	3	" What happen to your sister ? "
tr	0	He smiled , his thoughts far away .
tr	2	" How old were you ? "
tr	2	I would love to hear more . "
tr	2	Roberto himself had problems of his own .
tr	4	The ship creaked dangerously but kept together .
tr	4	They were in pitiful shape .
tr	4	She knew she loved him .
tr	4	She struggled to remove his wet boots .
tr	4	It made her skin tingle with pleasure .
tr	2	It was too long . "
tr	0	" How much ... ? "
tr	2	" I love you ! "
tr	1	There was no end and no beginning .
tr	2	" Do you enjoy it ? "
tr	2	But how , my love ? "
tr	0	There are no laws and no morals .
tr	1	Say only what is necessary . "
tr	2	" Yes Roberto of course . "
tr	0	" Yes , Captain . "
tr	4	She looked at him and he smiled .
tr	0	a bald-headed man asked with a grin .
tr	1	Wine sloshed against his boots .
tr	2	" Well , tell , man !
tr	1	Is she anything like Pedro said ? "
tr	3	But that did he not disclose .
tr	1	Are you hiding something ? "
tr	2	" How is Pedro ? "
tr	3	" The little sneak got away .
tr	0	" When did this happen ? "
tr	1	He slapped Tiny on his small shoulders .
tr	0	But he said nothing , as always .
tr	0	The plan was under way .
tr	2	Soon , Falcon , both thought .
tr	4	She paced their cabin nervously .
tr	0	That much she knew .
tr	2	It did not add up .
tr	2	His love of good books was evident .
tr	4	Her tender loving pirate .
tr	3	The scars proved that .
tr	0	She was pale and worn out .
tr	4	The Falcon , she guessed .
tr	4	He was extremely rough .
tr	3	Ah , but you are pretty . "
tr	0	" A handful ! "
tr	1	he said , looking at his men .
tr	0	It hurt and she flinched .
tr	1	he said with a smirk of defiance .
tr	2	" I am going to enjoy you .
tr	0	a pirate called out .
tr	0	" Take her away ! "
tr	1	" I wanted a virgin .
tr	1	" You pirate scum ! "
tr	2	The roof was shingled with dark wood .
tr	3	During the night they both woke simultaneously .
tr	2	They stood up and dressed .
tr	4	She had no need for that dress .
tr	0	He took her hand .
tr	1	The girl stopped crying , sniffing .
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	4	He cupped her cheeks again .
tr	2	I will kill you . "
tr	1	Another man screamed , running into Roberto .
tr	3	" Take them to the tavern . "
tr	2	Soft sobs came from Nora .
tr	2	You thought I would not know ? "
tr	0	He slapped him hard .
tr	2	" Playing daddy ! "
tr	0	Again a roar of laughter .
tr	4	Pride filled her heart .
tr	1	" Shut up ! "
tr	4	" You are safe , Pedro ! "
tr	1	" Yes sister . "
tr	2	" I love you . "
tr	2	" I love you too . "
tr	2	Just look at you ! "
tr	0	" You are not a pirate ? "
tr	2	" No my Rosa .
tr	4	He liked the man .
tr	0	He touched her lightly on the shoulder .
tr	4	he asked with concern .
tr	2	" Who are you , Señor ? "
tr	1	I am tired . "
tr	1	" I am so surprised .
tr	2	I do not know .
tr	2	" Would you like to sit down ?
tr	1	The Falcon was also impressed with him .
tr	2	" I missed you , too . "
tr	2	You do your father proud . "
tr	2	It does us all good . "
tr	2	" Did Roberto not tell you ? "
tr	2	He was proud of this woman .
tr	3	That is how we met .
tr	0	A blush appeared on Nora 's face .
tr	0	It is a long way back .
tr	1	" I am officially giving my resignation .
tr	1	I am finished with this life .
tr	4	They both came down with the fever .
tr	1	I am sorry , Roberto .
tr	0	" Thanks , Captain . "
tr	1	He wrapped his wife in his arms .
tr	1	This was his life and his family .
tr	2	Could he really live without his Rosa ?
tr	1	" It is nothing . "
tr	3	He tried to shrug it away .
tr	3	" Do you really think that ? "
tr	2	" My mother will adore you .
tr	4	Pierre squeezed his shoulder once again .
tr	4	He welcomed her body into his arms .
tr	1	" My sister ! "
tr	1	Cisco stopped his son .
tr	2	" Papa , I love Roberto . "
tr	1	Then you can explain this . "
tr	4	Roberto flinched under the piercing gaze .
tr	1	Cisco raised himself to his full height .
tr	1	His wife followed him .
tr	1	" Thanks , Señor . "
tr	1	This is a work of fiction .
tr	2	Still , he felt impelled to try .
tr	3	Finan turned back to the letters .
tr	4	For a time both men were silent .
tr	1	The timing is safer .
tr	1	Finan choked in indignation .
tr	2	" No , my lord .
tr	2	" For us both . "
tr	0	Rafe laughed heartily at that .
tr	1	" Yes , sir . "
tr	2	" I do understand , Rafe .
tr	1	She was suffering a great many misgivings .
tr	1	What possible use is that ? "
tr	4	Chapter Three " Adele ? "
tr	2	What 's wrong ? "
tr	2	" Tomorrow morning , child . "
tr	3	It mattered naught to her .
tr	1	" She is ready , sir ! "
tr	0	Had she even had much choice ?
tr	2	" Are you comfortable ? "
tr	1	" Can I call you Finn ?
tr	1	' Tis more friendly than Finan . "
tr	4	Rafe could have cursed in his vexation .
tr	1	" Perhaps she was mistaken ? "
tr	2	Of course he was not !
tr	1	Rafe grappled mightily within himself .
tr	1	Is it far from here ? "
tr	2	" You foolish girl ! "
tr	1	" Is it bad ? "
tr	2	" Will you be alright ? "
tr	2	" How long ? "
tr	2	" Why , what is wrong ? "
tr	4	What if she screamed ?
tr	2	Do you understand , Adele ?
tr	0	And it was as simple as that .
tr	4	Adele 's voice held an authoritative note .
tr	0	" What signal ? "
tr	0	Had he guessed at her thoughts ?
tr	1	" It is ? "
tr	1	Rafe continued looking at her blankly .
tr	0	" And your marksmanship ? "
tr	1	" What is it , Finn ?
tr	3	" Eda , stop it . "
tr	2	" What will we do ? "
tr	2	" How do you mean ? "
tr	1	This admission took Adele somewhat by surprise .
tr	1	Did I miss him ? "
tr	2	" I dare say he did .
tr	4	Where is he anyway ?
tr	1	He is not ill is he ? "
tr	1	Yet Finan could not .
tr	2	" How long do you stay ? "
tr	3	" That is not true ! "
tr	0	Finan smiled again and shook his head .
tr	2	The cold blooded turncoat !
tr	1	No sitting on the fence .
tr	1	Unfortunately , he had none .
tr	4	Again he looked sheepish .
tr	0	He broke off abruptly again .
tr	2	" You look tired . "
tr	0	Adele cast a quick glance at Rafe .
tr	4	He closed his eyes .
tr	2	What was he going to do ?
tr	0	What an awful mess !
tr	2	What was he going to do ?
tr	4	Adele 's voice was filled with concern .
tr	2	" I am well . "
tr	3	" Who taught you to whistle ? "
tr	1	------ " Lord Rafe ?
tr	1	" Lord Rafe ! "
tr	1	" Lord ... Rafe ! "
tr	3	" Get out ! "
tr	1	" I said out ! "
tr	2	So much for diplomacy .
tr	2	" Hello , Finan lad .
tr	1	asked Finan by no means taken in .
tr	2	" Now go . "
tr	1	asked Finan pretending ignorance .
tr	0	He shook his head .
tr	1	Is something amiss ? "
tr	1	" This is his best ? "
tr	4	Her fingers were icy and still damp .
tr	4	" Are you feeling any warmer ? "
tr	2	" He told you so ? "
tr	0	Rafe was silent and irritably so .
tr	0	Adele shot an anxious glance at Eda .
tr	4	Adele 's smile was a little forced .
tr	2	How was he to answer ?
tr	4	" Was it ... before ? "
tr	4	" I was once betrothed . "
tr	2	Did she ... ? "
tr	1	" Such assurance ! "
tr	4	Adele was thoughtful for some time .
tr	0	asked Eda with a shrug .
tr	4	They never gave chase to us .
tr	0	And who the he ... ? "
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	1	A frown creased her brow .
tr	2	" It would not be wrong ? "
tr	2	" Are you comfortable ? "
tr	0	" And you , my lady . "
tr	4	Then Rand released him .
tr	2	" The warrior you fool ! "
tr	2	Bron looked across to the cave .
tr	2	Both looked back to the warrior .
tr	0	" Finan , are you awake ? "
tr	4	" Where is the wood kept ? "
tr	0	" You have had another dream . "
tr	4	Chapter Twelve " Brogan ? "
tr	3	" ' Tis naught . "
tr	1	" Is it morning already ? "
tr	2	" Why do you defend him ? "
tr	4	Adele turned questioning eyes back to Rafe .
tr	1	" What is it , Finn ? "
tr	1	" Understand this , Finan . "
tr	4	So why did she still feel regret ?
tr	2	" Who are you ? "
tr	2	" Go on . "
tr	1	His voice was filled with merriment .
tr	0	" Ride as hard as you can .
tr	2	Follow the old Roman road .
tr	3	" It bolted . "
tr	1	" I shirk nothing !
tr	0	" I was aware . "
tr	0	He slapped the arm of his chair .
tr	1	" ' Tis a family tradition .
tr	4	He knew about Adele .
tr	2	Bron pointed off into the forest .
tr	1	" The warrior ? "
tr	2	He pointed again to the forest floor .
tr	1	Rand returned to Bron 's side .
tr	0	And why deny him a horse ? "
tr	2	Bron looked vaguely affronted .
tr	1	returned Lord Rand with a grin .
tr	2	Rand leaned forwards in his saddle .
tr	2	I will follow Lady Adele . "
tr	0	How had this happened ?
tr	2	More importantly how would it end ?
tr	2	He would know what to do surely ?
tr	0	Eda wiped her tears away angrily .
tr	4	Adele watched Eda nod her head regretfully .
tr	0	" Eda , can you hear ? "
tr	4	replied Adele , giggling in relief .
tr	3	It was too silent , too still .
tr	1	Finan tensed and turned quickly .
tr	3	" Not just yet . "
tr	2	" You will be well ? "
tr	2	Finan 's voice was hollow .
tr	1	" Lord Rafe ! "
tr	2	" I do not know .
tr	4	" I came for Adele . "
tr	4	Rafe 's eyes never left Rand .
tr	4	" Eda is here I see . "
tr	2	Rafe took another look at Rand .
tr	3	The truth was not so comfortable .
tr	0	" What do you want , Rand ?
tr	1	" To end this foolishness . "
tr	0	He looked again at Rafe .
tr	4	" Some friend ! "
tr	0	Finan 's voice was calm .
tr	2	" Do you really doubt it ? "
tr	3	" Then what is this about ?
tr	0	What do you want , Rand ? "
tr	2	" Why do you wish for peace ?
tr	2	" How could I forget it ? "
tr	4	" You were there !
tr	2	You forsook us ! "
tr	0	" Then who ? "
tr	1	Rand wrinkled his brow .
tr	3	" What is that ? "
tr	0	Rafe shook his head .
tr	1	Rafe turned to Rand .
tr	4	He left the tent in silence .
tr	1	Both men turned in surprise to Finan .
tr	1	" Lord Rafe ! "
tr	4	" You mean that she cried ? "
tr	1	" Lord Rafe , " corrected Rafe .
tr	0	" Then perhaps the child misheard . "
tr	0	" What ails you ? "
tr	0	Rafe shook his head .
tr	1	" Such enmity will not disappear overnight .
tr	1	" You cannot reason with Kent ! "
tr	3	" ' Tis settled then . "
tr	1	" What is it , Ine ?
tr	0	" He rules with his brothers ? "
tr	1	Her only concern had been for Finn .
tr	2	" Would not you ? "
tr	2	The soldier nodded and left .
tr	3	" Is aught the matter ? "
tr	1	That was when Finan knew .
tr	1	Finan raised his voice .
tr	1	" Finan , who did this ? "
tr	2	You cannot hold them alone ! "
tr	4	Oh , there you are . "
tr	0	" How is he ? "
tr	0	The soldier shook his head .
tr	2	" He will live ? "
tr	1	" Yes , sir . "
tr	3	That was how the betrothal came about .
tr	0	What did he think ? "
tr	1	" You mistake my meaning .
tr	0	" Are you awake , Master ? "
tr	2	" Did he ? "
tr	0	Rand shook his head .
tr	3	" Then whose fault is it ?
tr	1	Drogo shrugged his shoulders .
tr	2	Drogo shook his head .
tr	1	" It is time . "
tr	1	" I suppose , " Rand sighed .
tr	0	Again it was Eda that answered .
tr	1	" Your pardon , Finn ? "
tr	1	" Just do as I say . "
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	1	" Finan has been hurt . "
tr	1	" Adele , is something amiss ? "
tr	0	Eda was by turns alarmed and angry .
tr	0	Finally she shook her head .
tr	0	" Because I am so unhappy . "
tr	1	" No change . "
tr	0	" I was talking about you . "
tr	2	" Where do you go ? "
tr	3	" ' Tis not that .
tr	1	" Your ingenuity knows no bounds . "
tr	1	His irritation was somewhat diminished .
tr	4	Rafe could hardly believe it .
tr	0	" Thank you , my lady . "
tr	2	" Great goodness , for so long !
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	2	" It is enough for now . "
tr	0	Eda pulled a face of mock disapproval .
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	4	It made no sense .
tr	0	He should have known .
tr	3	It had been hard to stop .
tr	0	That knowledge would always haunt him .
tr	4	It had been his penance .
tr	4	Adele lifted her eyes to him hesitantly .
tr	4	Adele continued to regard him steadily .
tr	4	Pride had set these events in motion .
tr	4	" I have seen your daughters . "
tr	3	" Does it matter ? "
tr	1	" And it was not successful ? "
tr	2	" I already did . "
tr	1	" You could always run . "
tr	1	Who cares for Lord Rafe ? "
tr	4	He must never know ! "
tr	4	" Please , you must help me .
tr	2	" How do you feel ? "
tr	2	" So long ! "
tr	1	Finan 's tone was surprised .
tr	2	" How could you ? "
tr	1	Finan digested this information in silence .
tr	1	Finan 's brow wrinkled in concentration .
tr	1	Rand shrugged his shoulders .
tr	0	Finan shook his head .
tr	0	" At least there was a reason .
tr	0	" What are you ... ?
tr	2	" Good morning , my lord . "
tr	1	His tone was disbelieving .
tr	1	" Thank you , Finan . "
tr	2	" What do you do here ?
tr	1	His voice was soft .
tr	3	Not as things stood between them .
tr	2	No wonder he looked so appalled .
tr	0	Why did he not say something ?
tr	0	It was Rand again .
tr	0	" Was that Adele ?
tr	4	asked Rand , lifting one eyebrow .
tr	3	" It matters not . "
tr	2	" An old friend of yours . "
tr	0	Brogan had such a son .
tr	0	What had he sired ?
tr	2	asked Lord Brogan suddenly .
tr	1	" My men ? "
tr	1	It is , of course , unnecessary .
tr	2	Brogan nodded sagely and smiled within himself .
tr	2	Blood always bred to form .
tr	1	Rafe grinned towards his friend .
tr	4	" What does he do here ? "
tr	1	" Who is it ? "
tr	1	Prepare for what ? "
tr	2	Rafe felt physically sick .
tr	4	" Enough , " intervened Rafe .
tr	0	" A trap ? "
tr	2	Whom do I have to forgive ? "
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	0	Would she hate him ?
tr	1	Or would she turn him away forever ?
tr	2	Do you not wish to know ?
tr	2	Why do you forgive me ? "
tr	2	" Good morrow , Lady Adele . "
tr	2	" Very well , my lord . "
tr	0	Adele gazed at him blankly .
tr	3	" That is true . "
tr	4	Her eyes darkened slightly .
tr	1	Rafe started at her words .
tr	0	The thought spread warmth through his soul .
tr	3	" It matters greatly . "
tr	2	" I care for you also . "
tr	1	" Will you do it again ? "
tr	1	Rafe pulled himself back from his musings .
tr	1	Rafe blinked down at her in astonishment .
tr	1	growled Finan in parting .
tr	0	Rafe caught Adele 's hand .
tr	2	" You will be careful ? "
tr	0	assured Finan after a moment .
tr	1	Why was his confidence not shaken ?
tr	1	" Lord Rafe . "
tr	2	" What did you ever do ? "
tr	4	The rescue had been timely indeed .
tr	4	" Well you are the only one .
tr	0	His only thought was for her lands !
tr	0	He had learnt much from them .
tr	2	" I do not know ! "
tr	2	Rafe shook him vigorously .
tr	1	I swear I did no more ! "
tr	3	" Then that is that . "
tr	2	" Will he be all right ? "
tr	2	" How dare you ? "
tr	2	" Be still ! "
tr	3	Rand looked startled at the question .
tr	2	" I do not know . "
tr	0	He shook his head .
tr	2	For a moment Rand felt almost euphoric .
tr	2	Lord Brogan thought for a moment .
tr	1	Lord Brogan glanced around the tent .
tr	1	" Is his wound very serious ? "
tr	2	" ' Tis all a little complicated .
tr	2	" Or did they say dagger ? "
tr	0	" What ails the lad ?
tr	2	Lord Brogan looked the youth over .
tr	4	To Rand Lord Brogan seemed no different .
tr	4	" I see . "
tr	1	What is amiss with Finan ? "
tr	1	" Yes sir ? "
tr	1	Lord Brogan raised his eyebrows .
tr	1	" ' Tis much darker now . "
tr	4	Adele nodded , eagerly leaning forward .
tr	2	asked Lord Brogan softly .
tr	2	Rafe nodded toward Lord Brogan .
tr	0	Rafe shook his head .
tr	0	Lord Brogan sighed , shaking his head .
tr	2	I worry only for you . "
tr	0	Rafe shook his head .
tr	1	" Despite your constant assurances otherwise ? "
tr	4	" Ever , " corrected Rafe .
tr	0	What are you ... ? "
tr	2	Malcolm smiled , flashing his dimples .
tr	1	My imagination went wild .
tr	2	" Soon , " Malcolm said .
tr	0	I heard the unzipping of a backpack .
tr	1	Malcolm looped his fingers in mine .
tr	1	" What 's the confession ? "
tr	4	His cheeks turned pink .
tr	1	I put a finger to my lips .
tr	1	" No cider while on trial . "
tr	1	No indulging until proven innocent . "
tr	1	I spied the cloth napkins .
tr	1	He complied with a silly grin .
tr	2	I stomped my foot and shouted .
tr	1	I said in a quieter voice .
tr	2	" What 're you going to do ?
tr	2	Malcolm spoke in a husky voice .
tr	2	I felt only slightly bad .
tr	1	Just like I left him .
tr	4	I 'd turned away for three seconds !
tr	2	Like a bullet wound .
tr	4	But I never heard a gunshot .
tr	0	He was a waiter .
tr	1	I quickly covered it up .
tr	3	And what if they were still watching ?
tr	0	With a gun aimed at us ?
tr	3	" It 's not that bad . "
tr	4	His eyes blinked open briefly .
tr	1	He felt his arm , wincing .
tr	3	" Not that bad ?
tr	2	And it had to be soon .
tr	2	Only one thing to do .
tr	1	" I like you . "
tr	1	A twisted laugh escaped his lips .
tr	4	" Let me get help . "
tr	0	This was a warning ?
tr	0	Eating too many chocolat au pains ?
tr	0	His words puffed out with each breath .
tr	3	To bring my dates .
tr	3	Their dads like that . "
tr	1	Most people rushed past us .
tr	3	That 's what I needed to do .
tr	1	" Merci , " I said .
tr	1	I couldn 't get him involved .
tr	0	Or was he after Malcolm ?
tr	3	He might not have gotten shot .
tr	0	Why did he get shot ?
tr	2	My head pounded and my heart ached .
tr	3	Not put him on trial .
tr	0	What had I said ?
tr	2	I had to tell Dad .
tr	4	I entered the kitchen .
tr	1	" It 's serious . "
tr	1	Something kinda happened last night . "
tr	0	Warmth spread through my chest .
tr	1	Why did I blow it ?
tr	2	" Well , okay .
tr	0	" Oh , right .
tr	1	No sign of anything .
tr	2	Four " You look pale . "
tr	2	Dad sounded like he cared .
tr	0	" Can we talk later ? "
tr	2	We 'll talk later then . "
tr	3	Stay with the crowds . "
tr	2	" Maybe tomorrow . "
tr	1	My priority was finding Malcolm .
tr	2	No sign of Malcolm .
tr	1	I walked right into a big somebody .
tr	1	Cinnamon dusted his shoulders .
tr	1	And touring ancient castles ? "
tr	3	That is different . "
tr	1	" I cannot stand it anymore . "
tr	3	With the cute waiter ? "
tr	0	I already asked . "
tr	4	I remembered his fine-looking bare chest .
tr	2	" We 've got to go .
tr	3	That 's what I loved about her .
tr	1	I 'm an idiot . "
tr	0	" Oh , Savvy .
tr	1	" Almost sure . "
tr	4	The cops were already gone .
tr	1	" You sure about all this ? "
tr	4	" Yeah , I 'm sure . "
tr	4	" What if something terrible happened ? "
tr	3	" I doubt that . "
tr	2	" You can do it ! "
tr	2	They all nodded hello .
tr	3	" It is about to start . "
tr	0	That was all I cared about .
tr	0	Aimee and I played informants .
tr	1	I blew it a kiss .
tr	3	Something to talk to Dad about .
tr	1	I 'm pretty forgiving . "
tr	3	" What stunt ? "
tr	1	The guard raced forward .
tr	2	" You had food ?
tr	1	" You 'd better hurry . "
tr	1	Tourists passed me in a blur .
tr	2	I stopped and turned around .
tr	1	I whipped open my bag .
tr	2	I 'd probably lost her for good .
tr	2	Then I could look for Mom .
tr	4	Her voice was just above a whisper .
tr	2	I nodded at her .
tr	2	Can you do this for me ? "
tr	4	" Where are you staying ?
tr	2	You must follow my directions .
tr	4	Act like a teenager .
tr	1	Her words rushed out .
tr	1	" I promise . "
tr	3	What had gotten into her ?
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	4	" I can 't believe you ! "
tr	1	I 'm sorry . "
tr	4	He put his face inches from mine .
tr	0	He whipped his head toward her .
tr	1	" I am sorry .
tr	2	Not good at all .
tr	0	And what could I say ?
tr	2	" Oo , I am so sorry .
tr	3	" This was not your fault .
tr	0	" You made a mistake .
tr	4	I tucked her hair behind her ears .
tr	2	No telling what he 'll do . "
tr	1	" I will be fine .
tr	3	I knew better than to say anything .
tr	2	" Oo , scary . "
tr	2	Cliff Peyton had called my dad .
tr	3	But something was totally off with him .
tr	3	" Not yet . "
tr	4	He was extremely volatile . "
tr	1	" I 'm fine .
tr	1	I 'm stuck in traffic .
tr	2	" You can 't fool me .
tr	3	I 'm about to kick your butt .
tr	4	I 'd recognize that voice anywhere .
tr	0	" Told ya , " Frankie said .
tr	1	Frankie struggled against his ropes .
tr	1	I 'm sure of it . "
tr	4	She 'd better be okay .
tr	2	I choked down a nervous laugh .
tr	1	I read it . "
tr	1	I 'm sorry . "
tr	0	I decided on a personal approach .
tr	3	" Got it ? "
tr	2	" Don 't you touch her ! "
tr	4	She ruined everything . "
tr	2	We 'll talk later about refunds . "
tr	2	Time to go home .
tr	2	My bedroom door was open .
tr	1	I spun around to confuse any intruder .
tr	2	What would someone want from us ?
tr	0	My measly piggy bank ?
tr	0	Or maybe a package !
tr	1	I brought it inside .
tr	3	Now that told me something .
tr	2	Voices floated in from outside .
tr	1	Anything else you want to know ? "
tr	4	Maps of Paris covered the table .
tr	4	" Where 's Aimee ? "
tr	2	Ten " Dad ? "
tr	3	I tried not to think about Aimee .
tr	2	Gray nodded to me .
tr	2	Not a good sign .
tr	3	I decided to start first .
tr	2	" No , really .
tr	2	I told him to shadow you ! "
tr	4	We 've broken the contract . "
tr	2	" I 'll apologize .
tr	3	The words tasted bitter on my tongue .
tr	0	The apology was only a habit .
tr	0	" Are you that unhappy ? "
tr	2	I know you slack off at times .
tr	0	Oh , the shame !
tr	4	Dad moved to the brown leather loveseat .
tr	4	He rubbed his temples .
tr	2	You can 't fire her too .
tr	4	I held the paper .
tr	2	Not for one second .
tr	3	" What about Peyton ? "
tr	2	Dad waved his hand .
tr	4	We 'd be spies .
tr	4	Why wouldn 't he believe me ?
tr	1	His stress level was rising .
tr	4	" Yeah , sure . "
tr	2	Dad rubbed the scruff on his jaw .
tr	4	My arm jerked with the revelation .
tr	3	But this wasn 't about me .
tr	0	It was about Aimee .
tr	0	What was he talking about ?
tr	4	What else had he noticed ?
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	0	I managed to swallow .
tr	4	" Why are you here ? "
tr	2	He stood and took a step closer .
tr	4	" The note explains everything . "
tr	1	And with Aimee missing ?
tr	3	" Don 't answer that . "
tr	3	I start training today .
tr	1	" Sorry about your friend . "
tr	1	" I 'm going to check inside .
tr	1	I missed my friends and my mom .
tr	0	This Extravaganza was it .
tr	3	Malcolm interrupted my thoughts .
tr	1	" I was thinking about Aimee . "
tr	2	" Not really . "
tr	2	" How 'd you get home ? "
tr	1	" Er , right . "
tr	0	Malcolm grabbed his backpack .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	1	" What 's she saying ? "
tr	2	Marie stopped in front of us .
tr	1	" What was I thinking ?
tr	2	It has been far too long . "
tr	1	She kissed both his cheeks .
tr	1	" I was visiting next door .
tr	0	It is your lucky day .
tr	1	I will be right back . "
tr	0	He rubbed his shin .
tr	1	I licked my dry lips .
tr	4	Is Aimee here ? "
tr	4	Marie lowered her eyebrows .
tr	1	" I 've got it , pumpkin .
tr	2	Be right back . "
tr	2	Except for a pair of hiking boots .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry . "
tr	2	" What now ? "
tr	1	I had a mission .
tr	0	He also carried a small black backpack .
tr	1	I motioned him inside .
tr	3	Because it 's totally hot .
tr	2	Dang , he looked good in black .
tr	2	" What now ? "
tr	2	I shook it off .
tr	2	How to pick a lock . "
tr	0	Malcolm glanced back at the door .
tr	0	Malcolm crouched close by .
tr	2	" Okay , move over .
tr	1	I wasn 't sure .
tr	4	Maybe he 'd gotten fired or divorced .
tr	2	" Your dad ! "
tr	3	" Maybe he cut it short .
tr	1	" Hurry up , " I whispered .
tr	4	I need more time . "
tr	4	I remembered the Extravaganza I entered .
tr	4	Something on the advertisement mentioned prize money .
tr	1	I can sell off some assets . "
tr	1	Like our house in Pennsylvania ?
tr	0	" Watch and learn . "
tr	1	" I might 've found something . "
tr	3	" That could be for anything . "
tr	2	Could we go to jail for this ?
tr	2	" Hey , how you doing ? "
tr	4	The Eiffel Tower ? "
tr	2	" How could I forget ? "
tr	4	" You ruined everything ! "
tr	3	Peyton , right ? "
tr	2	Not my actions , not my words .
tr	2	" Good one . "
tr	0	I whipped away from Malcolm 's grasp .
tr	1	I pointed a finger at him .
tr	2	" I know you do . "
tr	2	I followed Malcolm 's lead .
tr	3	" That 's right , coward .
tr	2	Enjoy your last days of freedom ! "
tr	0	Probably a vase or lamp .
tr	1	" Yep , " I said .
tr	1	" Thanks for the professional analysis . "
tr	4	He needed an answer .
tr	1	He traced his thumb across my lips .
tr	0	He smiled a warm and cocky grin .
tr	0	" Why yes , I do . "
tr	1	All combinations of ingredients failed epically .
tr	0	What was it really all about ?
tr	1	It was so useless .
tr	0	I waved at my face .
tr	2	I nodded like the dutiful daughter .
tr	1	I bit my lip , then spoke .
tr	1	" Sure , right . "
tr	2	I forgot you were stopping by . "
tr	2	I forgot to tell you . "
tr	4	Malcolm stepped closer to me .
tr	2	Your dad agreed . "
tr	2	" There go all my plans .
tr	2	You might as well go home . "
tr	2	I could be relaxed about this too .
tr	4	" Get dressed . "
tr	1	I blew air through my lips .
tr	4	He tried to hide a muffled snicker .
tr	0	I stopped and pulled my arm away .
tr	1	" I 'm fine .
tr	2	" Let 's go , Hilda . "
tr	2	Kind of like my mom and dad .
tr	3	Except they 're not that old yet .
tr	1	I picked up my pace .
tr	4	Eighteen Malcolm grabbed my hand .
tr	4	Let 's enjoy the day . "
tr	4	Dark shapes moved in between the trees .
tr	1	Sound like him ? "
tr	3	It couldn 't be .
tr	4	I needed to be alone .
tr	0	He held out his hand .
tr	2	" Did we enjoy our honeymoon ? "
tr	3	It was much more than that .
tr	1	Birds burst from the trees like fireworks .
tr	2	Don 't look back . "
tr	1	" I 'll be right behind .
tr	3	Another shot shattered the air .
tr	2	My whole body shook .
tr	2	Who would shoot at us ?
tr	2	I didn 't dare move .
tr	0	" Who -- " " Shh .
tr	1	The wind moving in the branches .
tr	1	Malcolm 's breath on my neck .
tr	3	Footsteps on the gravel path .
tr	2	Who could it be ?
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	0	And all that money .
tr	2	About your mom ? "
tr	4	" You 're the best ! "
tr	1	Where are your provisions ?
tr	2	" Good cover . "
tr	1	I bit my lip .
tr	0	" Black crickets . "
tr	0	" A year away from home ? "
tr	3	I knew something about that .
tr	2	Your dad loves you .
tr	2	I can tell . "
tr	1	I shivered in its shadow .
tr	2	I had reached that dead end .
tr	1	Next Monday , then ? "
tr	2	I knocked on the door .
tr	2	Not one hint of spice or warmth .
tr	3	Was it that loud last time ?
tr	3	I turned to the closet .
tr	4	Maybe I should hide in the closet ?
tr	2	I couldn 't hold on much longer .
tr	4	The intruder seemed to have vanished .
tr	2	I didn 't dare move .
tr	4	" No one lives here . "
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	0	" What about Marie and Aimee ?
tr	3	And then it hit me .
tr	0	And that was never a good sign .
tr	2	But no sign of Mom .
tr	2	" You , little girl . "
tr	2	I stopped and turned .
tr	0	A creepy chill crawled across my back .
tr	1	" I applaud your efforts , girl .
tr	3	The layout was simple but breathtaking .
tr	4	I shoved the cupcakes under the table .
tr	1	And keeping my mind on my mission .
tr	0	Maybe she wasn 't just paranoid .
tr	0	Why a special camera ?
tr	2	The crowds drifted around me .
tr	1	Mom was possibly a cold-blooded assassin .
tr	2	And now I was too .
tr	4	Like mother like daughter .
tr	3	Not to chat with me .
tr	1	Extremely suspicious since the shop was closed .
tr	2	Did Mom know about all this ?
tr	1	I slipped inside after him .
tr	0	The shop was quiet and dark .
tr	2	Voices echoed from beyond the open doorway .
tr	0	Man , it was heavy .
tr	4	I kneeled and peered out the opening .
tr	3	Wasn 't the butler always guilty ?
tr	2	Did he work for Jolie , too ?
tr	1	I might 've killed a man .
tr	3	They continued to talk .
tr	4	Malcolm interjected , speaking clearly .
tr	4	You planted the fake evidence .
tr	2	My body turned rigid .
tr	4	I remembered his brush off .
tr	1	" Get the information from your girlfriend .
tr	1	Moments with Malcolm tore at me .
tr	1	Tender moments , laughing , and flirting .
tr	0	No way was Malcolm a hired gun .
tr	4	He showed me his stuffed backpack .
tr	2	" Yeah , not in the mood .
tr	2	Not with the big commotion going on .
tr	0	" So what happened anyway ? "
tr	0	" Oh , right .
tr	1	He zipped open his pack .
tr	1	I wasn 't an assassin .
tr	1	Malcolm caught my arm .
tr	3	You beat out top pastry chefs . "
tr	1	" Just luck , " I murmured .
tr	4	" The finals are in two weeks .
tr	2	I shook off my paranoia .
tr	1	I was just an assignment to him .
tr	1	I promise I won 't bite . "
tr	4	I 'd heard those words before .
tr	3	" I thought we were past that .
tr	0	A crafty look played across his face .
tr	1	Malcolm popped a grape in his mouth .
tr	0	" What about your family .
tr	2	How about your mom ? "
tr	4	He flashed me a fake smile .
tr	0	" Oh , yeah .
tr	1	I swear she was psycho .
tr	0	" And what was that ? "
tr	2	" Probably some jealous competitor . "
tr	2	I turned and faced him .
tr	1	I think Jolie did . "
tr	3	" True , but still . "
tr	1	" You 're right .
tr	1	Would anything distract him from his mission ?
tr	1	What was the reason behind her obsessions ?
tr	2	I forced a giggle .
tr	2	" Good one . "
tr	2	Leaving so soon ? "
tr	0	He might hold the answers .
tr	3	I had lost touch with the truth .
tr	4	Nancy gave me her motherly smile .
tr	4	Everyone was staring at me .
tr	1	A blush crept across my skin .
tr	2	I had to cover .
tr	1	I couldn 't disappoint him .
tr	0	Dad can brainstorm some pretty wacky ideas .
tr	1	Like dropping from ceilings .
tr	2	" Why wouldn 't we ? "
tr	0	He looked around at all the staff .
tr	2	How could Malcolm betray me like that ?
tr	3	I couldn 't take it anymore .
tr	2	" How 's he coming along ?
tr	0	She 'd laugh at the irony .
tr	1	I slipped in like a night shadow .
tr	0	He was probably faking it all anyway .
tr	1	How had I missed it ?
tr	4	He had a file on me .
tr	2	" Soooo , " Malcolm drawled .
tr	1	Malcolm 's voice was sultry and suggestive .
tr	1	" I love it .
tr	0	" And take a shot . "
tr	0	" You start , " Malcolm said .
tr	2	" How 'd you know ? "
tr	1	A family of assassins ?
tr	2	Or so I 'd thought .
tr	0	Then you showed up with her . "
tr	2	I will call friends .
tr	4	" We need to talk . "
tr	1	" Yeah right , " I said .
tr	2	He moved away from the door .
tr	2	" So now I 'm your prisoner ?
tr	3	They talked about my mother .
tr	3	" I want the truth . "
tr	1	He didn 't say anything .
tr	1	Seconds or maybe minutes passed .
tr	4	My heart rate spiked .
tr	3	" What about the girl ? "
tr	3	That we couldn 't work out .
tr	0	That I was an assignment .
tr	0	My plan was backfiring .
tr	1	" I admit nothing . "
tr	2	She used to work for Jolie . "
tr	2	" Did she ? "
tr	0	" Go ahead . "
tr	2	" Are you working for Jolie ? "
tr	2	" I 'm a good worker .
tr	2	Possibly a good place to keep prisoners .
tr	2	My only lead was Jolie .
tr	1	Was this his house ?
tr	2	Only one way to find out .
tr	4	Her voice plucked my heartstrings .
tr	3	It couldn 't be .
tr	2	How could I not have recognized it ?
tr	4	And someone as sweet as Marie ?
tr	0	Maybe she was kidnapped later that day ?
tr	3	Or the start of it .
tr	4	I 'd be a hero .
tr	4	" Please , join me . "
tr	3	Use the potted plant ?
tr	2	" These cookies look delicious .
tr	0	He waved his hand .
tr	0	We have always had this tradition .
tr	4	Yeah , sure . "
tr	1	My determination slipped a bit .
tr	4	I have not seen her there . "
tr	3	I know the truth .
tr	0	And my name is Savvy .
tr	1	You are quite amusing . "
tr	1	I stopped inching away .
tr	0	What could I say ?
tr	3	No smart answer to that ?
tr	0	Basically , I had no one .
tr	1	I 'm a friend .
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	1	I must get back inside . "
tr	2	" Any more shootings ? "
tr	1	I bit into an apple and munched .
tr	3	" It 's great .
tr	3	Get the word out . "
tr	2	Dad nodded to the fridge .
tr	1	" Spy Games business . "
tr	3	" That 's right .
tr	1	A smile lit up his face .
tr	2	Someone knocked on the door .
tr	0	" You ready ? "
tr	1	And if Malcolm didn 't act suspicious .
tr	3	Another big tourist place . "
tr	2	Dad 's looking to cut costs . "
tr	0	He set this whole thing up ?
tr	2	Or was I being too melodramatic ?
tr	3	Let 's get started . "
tr	2	We climbed around and around and around .
tr	0	" We 're almost halfway .
tr	3	" I 'm not sure about that .
tr	3	I stopped to rest .
tr	0	" We 're almost halfway .
tr	0	And there 's a small café ! "
tr	0	But what I saw confirmed my fears .
tr	1	Did Paris hold something against me ?
tr	2	Surely , Malcolm had left .
tr	1	No sneaking around this time .
tr	1	No slinking or acting like a criminal .
tr	3	I tiptoed across the tiny hall .
tr	2	A car door shut outside .
tr	2	Or a smoke bomb ?
tr	4	A voice cleared on the stairs .
tr	2	Jolie whistled in the hall .
tr	4	I begged forgiveness for anything and everything .
tr	1	I don 't usually notice hands .
tr	0	He was taking a shower ?
tr	2	Someone rapped on the door and shouted .
tr	3	The water shut off .
tr	2	Jolie pulled on his pants .
tr	2	I probably looked like one too .
tr	2	I climbed down and down .
tr	4	Water seeped from the limestone walls .
tr	4	Out of the darkness , Aimee appeared .
tr	1	Jolie lifted his arms in exasperation .
tr	0	A black T-shirt matched his black jeans .
tr	4	The rope glimmered in the soft light .
tr	1	An Indiana Jones whip .
tr	1	So we 'd shared a kiss .
tr	3	They couldn 't hurt me .
tr	1	With frayed ropes around it .
tr	1	To search for the prisoner !
tr	3	That felt like a century ago .
tr	0	Because Mom wasn 't talking .
tr	1	My fingers curled into a fist .
tr	2	I pushed and pushed .
tr	1	I stopped , my foot in midair .
tr	0	I heard my name and Extravaganza .
tr	0	Talking about me again .
tr	3	I 'm not that interesting .
tr	1	I hid my gasp .
tr	0	Is that how he thought of me ?
tr	4	He paused , probably to breathe .
tr	1	It turned my insides .
tr	0	Did he care about me at all ?
tr	3	I had to get out of there .
tr	0	The manager grabbed my arm .
tr	1	I kicked the guy in the shins .
tr	0	Cakes splattered against the wall .
tr	0	And maybe I was .
tr	4	Someone yelled behind me .
tr	2	He was too convincing for a waiter .
tr	4	Would he ever hurt me ?
tr	3	I had to stop and rest .
tr	4	Mom had never been honest with me .
tr	1	His alliance with Jolie .
tr	2	Oh , those traitorous lips .
tr	0	And this was a tricky one .
tr	2	He wanted to know what I knew .
tr	1	" Major girl problems . "
tr	1	I lied like a pro .
tr	0	Always a good excuse .
tr	3	" That 's fine .
tr	3	The tarts have gotten top reviews .
tr	2	You 'll love it . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry .
tr	1	Tell me about my mom .
tr	3	You want to talk about something else .
tr	0	I punched him in the stomach .
tr	1	" For a girl . "
tr	1	I punched him again .
tr	1	But you wouldn 't .
tr	2	You got yourself into this . "
tr	1	I didn 't think so either .
tr	1	" Stop asking questions .
tr	2	As you know . "
tr	4	I 'd been through the wringer .
tr	0	Who was in our apartment ?
tr	2	The floor creaked right outside my door .
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	2	" Come on into the living room .
tr	1	" It 's about Spy Games . "
tr	1	" And one more thing . "
tr	2	Dads don 't lie .
tr	2	" Oh , okay . "
tr	3	I blurted out , testing him .
tr	3	Don 't forget that . "
tr	4	He believed in me .
tr	3	At least it wasn 't zebra striped .
tr	1	A switch in my brain flicked on .
tr	1	I 'd been doing it .
tr	4	I needed to be at the Extravaganza .
tr	4	Spies could be normal people .
tr	2	Don 't slow down .
tr	2	Then I found the book .
tr	1	Truth was I missed her .
tr	2	He could call the police .
tr	2	Only one way to find out .
tr	3	But it didn 't matter .
tr	2	No loaf of bread on the counter .
tr	4	The nose strips were gone .
tr	4	The books , the maps , everything .
tr	4	The kind of spy who saved people .
tr	2	And I 'd make my dad proud .
tr	2	Dad studied his notes .
tr	1	What was I thinking ?
tr	3	I clutched my throat .
tr	3	I thought about Aimee .
tr	1	Malcolm ran right into me .
tr	0	He finally managed to say .
tr	4	My eyes flicked over to Malcolm 's .
tr	1	Today I 'd save my mom .
tr	0	His voice was sharp and commanding .
tr	2	He nodded and strode off .
tr	4	I glanced over at Jolie 's table .
tr	2	" How dare you ? "
tr	1	He waved his hands in disgust .
tr	2	" Worked with my dad ?
tr	0	What are you talking about ? "
tr	4	He laughed , a deep belly laugh .
tr	4	Tears streamed from his eyes .
tr	1	This is serious . "
tr	1	No men in dark clothing .
tr	2	He took a bow .
tr	0	And they call Americans obnoxious .
tr	0	" Malcolm was a plant . "
tr	3	Okay that sounded totally childish .
tr	2	" I 'm a nobody . "
tr	2	" I know things about you too .
tr	2	I know about your precious Aimee .
tr	4	His breath smelled like peppermint and sugar .
tr	1	My body trembled under his roar .
tr	1	A devious smile pranced across his face .
tr	2	I mumbled out words of protest .
tr	2	" You can 't fool me .
tr	2	Throbbing pain racked my body .
tr	3	My family wanted to take him out ?
tr	1	I think I could find it again .
tr	2	With a groan , I stood up .
tr	3	It was a straight shot .
tr	1	Fresh ropes bound his ankles and hands .
tr	1	Once , and then again .
tr	2	" You know me ? "
tr	1	What was I thinking ?
tr	1	I knew it . "
tr	4	The last time I was here .
tr	1	I tried to help him up .
tr	2	I 'm not strong enough to escape .
tr	3	I tipped the bottle .
tr	3	" That is not important .
tr	0	A few years ago I had visions .
tr	3	Was that muffled footsteps I heard ?
tr	1	His voice rose to a frantic pitch .
tr	4	You were gone . "
tr	4	When I left , they followed me .
tr	4	The prisoner pulled me behind him .
tr	3	Could this guy be telling the truth ?
tr	3	But I felt nothing .
tr	2	" Oh my God .
tr	2	Oh my God . "
tr	1	" My time has come .
tr	1	I need to finish .
tr	0	Something had to help .
tr	2	They were still full of compassion .
tr	2	I didn 't say a word . "
tr	2	Not a good sign .
tr	1	And it wasn 't mine .
tr	1	My voice turned sharp and prickly .
tr	3	Kidnapped by that lunatic Peyton !
tr	3	Was that too much to ask ? "
tr	2	I know about you and Jolie . "
tr	2	She couldn 't look at me .
tr	4	" There is no time . "
tr	1	She grasped his hands .
tr	2	" You must see a doctor .
tr	4	We wasted enough time already . "
tr	1	And my mom ? "
tr	1	Was she an assassin ?
tr	0	At least not me and Dad .
tr	2	That did not look good . "
tr	0	Aimee put her arm around his back .
tr	4	He pulled me close again .
tr	0	Aimee put a hand to his face .
tr	2	He must go now . "
tr	4	Tears filled her eyes once more .
tr	1	I am still your friend .
tr	1	I am like you . "
tr	0	" Trying to save my family . "
tr	0	Had that been a warning for him ?
tr	2	I had to know .
tr	2	" I do not know . "
tr	1	My grandfather is in trouble .
tr	1	" I am sorry .
tr	3	But the words stuck in my throat .
tr	3	At the doorway , the man turned .
tr	2	I had to focus .
tr	3	A crowd of people strutted past .
tr	1	I wasn 't sure .
tr	3	Then Jolie had told the truth .
tr	2	He was working with my dad .
tr	1	This was so not in the plans .
tr	2	They jostled for position .
tr	0	He cleared his throat and spoke again .
tr	3	French sputtered out of his mouth .
tr	1	The frosting shone in the sun .
tr	2	" Go back home .
tr	2	Do you know how dangerous that is ?
tr	2	" Hey , Dad ! "
tr	3	Time for the truth .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry . "
tr	2	Dad and I turned and watched .
tr	2	Dad gripped me in a hug .
tr	0	" Say that again ? "
tr	2	He had to be kidding .
tr	2	But you took risks .
tr	4	He deserves it . "
tr	1	Inch by inch , Jolie turned around .
tr	1	His life was in danger .
tr	2	What did you do ? "
tr	1	Just stole his pastries .
tr	0	" Um , Savvy ? "
tr	1	Evil is nigh . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , sir . "
tr	4	Jolie narrowed his eyes .
tr	2	Possibly for the kill .
tr	2	" Silly girl . "
tr	1	" Your life is in danger . "
tr	0	" Um , Savvy ? "
tr	0	You Americans are not rational .
tr	2	Dad puffed out his chest .
tr	1	He signaled to his guards .
tr	0	I grabbed a hunk of cake .
tr	0	And I had to warn him .
tr	0	A tart smeared into Jolie 's hair .
tr	4	Aimee 's smile flashed in my eyes .
tr	4	But they were there .
tr	1	But what if I missed ?
tr	1	Frosting and tears stung my eyes .
tr	2	A sob poured out of me .
tr	3	It wasn 't me .
tr	4	He had to be here .
tr	2	No one stopped to help .
tr	3	I struggled to get to my feet .
tr	1	A raspy noise gurgled from my throat .
tr	1	I didn 't recognize it .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry .
tr	2	Forty-six Adrenaline shot through my body .
tr	1	He didn 't say anything .
tr	0	I flashed in and out of awareness .
tr	2	I know all about you . "
tr	2	My words came out a sob .
tr	1	" I wouldn 't hurt you .
tr	2	" Don 't move . "
tr	3	The bullet wasn 't in too far .
tr	1	This will sting . "
tr	0	" What the hell ? "
tr	1	" I 'm cleaning it .
tr	2	" Good luck . "
tr	0	Warmth hung like a halo around Peyton .
tr	1	He bit his lip .
tr	3	" That was my brother .
tr	0	And at the Extravaganza .
tr	2	" Who are you ? "
tr	3	" Just tell me the truth . "
tr	1	She 's a scrapbooker . "
tr	3	I highly doubted that was true .
tr	2	He took a swig .
tr	0	A battle raged on his face .
tr	4	They have been for centuries .
tr	0	" What about my family ? "
tr	1	My mom wasn 't an assassin .
tr	1	My mom wasn 't an assassin .
tr	1	My mom wasn 't an assassin .
tr	2	" How 'd you find out ? "
tr	0	" We laid a trap . "
tr	3	" What about the prisoner ?
tr	3	My heart broke a little bit .
tr	1	I don 't even know why .
tr	1	Even with frosting in your hair . "
tr	1	The words sank in and something broke .
tr	1	His soft lips were warm and inviting .
tr	3	But I can 't .
tr	3	" We can get past this .
tr	3	I won 't let that happen . "
tr	1	" The judge pronounces you guilty . "
tr	2	Blood rushed to my face .
tr	1	And he 'll hunt you down ! "
tr	0	About our families and the age-old battle .
tr	2	Live a normal life . "
tr	2	How soon would the vodka wear off ?
tr	3	I had to try .
tr	0	That was my goal .
tr	4	Like anyone would believe my story .
tr	2	Sweat dripped down my sides .
tr	1	" I didn 't see anyone running !
tr	3	The spotlight stayed on me .
tr	2	Cold words bounced off me .
tr	2	I yelled for my dad .
tr	2	I would be strong .
tr	0	Malcolm was a sneak and a liar .
tr	1	I hope you liked it !
tr	1	It 's just smoke , Cassidy . "
tr	4	A sure signal I needed to leave .
tr	1	She was still fixated .
tr	2	I held out my chemistry book .
tr	0	My getaway slowed to a crawl .
tr	3	I waved the thick text .
tr	2	I was too young to die .
tr	3	I blurted out the truth .
tr	2	My parents will kill me .
tr	4	They were all innocent mistakes .
tr	3	I should 've stuck to the story .
tr	1	But no such luck .
tr	2	She 'd love to hear from you !
tr	2	" I 'll leave it alone . "
tr	0	" Maybe an old flag marker ? "
tr	3	" It wasn 't that shape .
tr	2	Maybe a glass of milk would help .
tr	0	" Shhh , " he hushed .
tr	3	" Just watch . "
tr	4	" Keep watching . "
tr	3	What is that ? "
tr	3	" But what is that image ? "
tr	2	" Not likely . "
tr	4	That 's when the white image appeared .
tr	0	It 'd scare them away .
tr	2	" Oh my God ! "
tr	2	" Do you think so ? "
tr	0	" Maybe a backpack or a jacket .
tr	2	" You lost me . "
tr	2	So , we leave food for it .
tr	2	Steve Lyndon nodded his approval .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	1	" Just worried . "
tr	3	Scott pointed to the thicket .
tr	2	" Only one way to find out .
tr	2	It 's for you . "
tr	1	He had no intentions of moving .
tr	3	" That 's a little girl ! "
tr	3	" That kid has to eat .
tr	0	" What makes you say that ? "
tr	1	" Find anything ? "
tr	3	But it was laying on the tray .
tr	1	" Find anything ? "
tr	3	What next then ? "
tr	1	I think she 's too wild . "
tr	2	" You forget something ? "
tr	4	It was peeled perfectly .
tr	0	That 's a banana peel .
tr	1	Steve Lyndon 's frown was instant .
tr	1	My main concern is winning her trust .
tr	0	" When did she show up ? "
tr	2	" Me too . "
tr	0	He held out his hand .
tr	0	" Our help with what ? "
tr	2	" You 're not going alone . "
tr	3	Scott smiled at the little girl .
tr	2	" We will go with you . "
tr	1	This is open government land . "
tr	1	You 're nuts ! "
tr	2	" You can come too . "
tr	0	" And take it easy . "
tr	3	" Wait , " Scott said gently .
tr	2	" He can come too . "
tr	4	" Where do you want them ? "
tr	2	You 'll be alright . "
tr	3	" Tell me about it . "
tr	1	" You 're probably right .
tr	2	" What kind of problem ? "
tr	0	" The chains won 't reach ? "
tr	1	" Thanks boss . "
tr	1	The man waved and grinned .
tr	3	Scott asked Doug Burnett .
tr	0	He shook his head .
tr	1	" Ain 't gon na work .
tr	2	" You ok Chet ? "
tr	1	" You ever play pick-up sticks ? "
tr	2	" Do you see another option ? "
tr	4	" I see three options .
tr	1	One , play pick-up sticks .
tr	1	" He 's stuck . "
tr	1	She 's pushing on it . "
tr	2	" Still pushing and pulling . "
tr	4	Just leave them alone .
tr	3	" We thought of that .
tr	1	" She 's wild .
tr	0	Did she want help again ?
tr	3	What was she trying to do ?
tr	3	Scott smiled at the coyote .
tr	3	He frowned at that .
tr	4	" Sleeping , where ? "
tr	2	Scott forced the frown from his forehead .
tr	0	" Not far away . "
tr	2	Both of his eyebrows shot upward .
tr	2	" Ready to go ? "
tr	2	" Ready to go . "
tr	2	Scott smiled and nodded .
tr	2	They can come too . "
tr	4	It was definitely beautiful here .
tr	3	Scott took a deep breath .
tr	4	The winters here were horrid .
tr	4	He smiled at her .
tr	1	Her nod was instant .
tr	3	Sidney pointed to the north .
tr	2	" Show you ? "
tr	2	" Ready to go ? "
tr	4	Scott came up beside her .
tr	3	The reply was instant .
tr	1	" Find anything ? "
tr	2	What are you going to do ? "
tr	2	How much time do you want ? "
tr	3	It 's just after nine .
tr	4	See you in a few .
tr	2	Scott laughed then nodded .
tr	2	" Ready to go ? "
tr	4	It seemed well traveled .
tr	2	" Ready to go ? "
tr	1	" Wait , " she said quietly .
tr	4	She looked at the bones then nodded .
tr	1	But no writing of any kind .
tr	4	Where are you keeping it safe ? "
tr	2	" Show you ? "
tr	0	He shook his head .
tr	3	" Not yet . "
tr	3	" That 's ok .
tr	3	Scott opened it to see two pictures .
tr	2	Do you have a brother ? "
tr	1	" Mommy would like that . "
tr	0	He had to think of her first .
tr	1	" Find anything ? "
tr	2	" Ready to go ? "
tr	2	" Ready to go . "
tr	1	" Was Sammie your brother ? "
tr	2	" Are you ok ? "
tr	2	She smiled and nodded .
tr	3	" Tell me about it . "
tr	2	" You 'd think so .
tr	4	He had to have been buried . "
tr	1	Her smile was instant .
tr	2	" Daddy 's wallet . "
tr	0	" Oh , " he said .
tr	3	Well , it was better than nothing .
tr	3	Scott closed the snap compartment .
tr	0	That was a high gas bill .
tr	0	A big red and white car ?
tr	3	Scott thought that was a distinct possibility .
tr	1	She is truly a nature 's child .
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	2	He smiled and nodded .
tr	3	Are you that man Scott ? "
tr	3	Chapter 8 " Scott ? "
tr	2	She nodded and was gone .
tr	3	But her studying had not stopped there .
tr	2	They made a good doorbell .
tr	0	He shook the man 's hand .
tr	2	" Got time for coffee Josh ? "
tr	3	What brings you out this way ?
tr	2	" Hello darlin ' . "
tr	2	" What do you mean Josh ? "
tr	1	" Jansen , isn 't it ? "
tr	4	The man 's smile melted .
tr	2	He took a gulp of his coffee .
tr	1	" Thanks Josh , " Scott smiled .
tr	0	he asked through the lack light .
tr	2	She motioned to her closed bedroom door .
tr	4	" They 're all in there . "
tr	1	" I 'm watching . "
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	2	" A coyote . "
tr	2	" Do you know it ? "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry . "
tr	3	" Part of it .
tr	1	Princess is watching them right now .
tr	0	Her hand curled around his tightly .
tr	2	She looked toward the window .
tr	4	" Here comes the sheriff . "
tr	1	" Dark blue Ford four by four .
tr	1	Like a midnight blue . "
tr	2	Josh looked to Scott for an answer .
tr	4	Both were answers he was expecting .
tr	2	" You know who it is ? "
tr	1	" I think so .
tr	0	She sighed softly then shook her head .
tr	3	Scott chuckled at the playfulness .
tr	1	I 'm Dan Jansen . "
tr	0	he stammered and swallowed again .
tr	0	There was that voice again .
tr	2	She took a step forward .
tr	1	He shrank back into the corner farther .
tr	2	She took another step forward .
tr	1	" I 'm really sorry . "
tr	3	There was no way to stop it .
tr	3	It had to burn out by itself .
tr	1	" Sit down Jansen . "
tr	1	" I said sit down .
tr	3	" Watch , " Scott said .
tr	0	" No , " he said casually .
tr	2	" You know ? "
tr	1	" So does she . "
tr	2	" All of them .
tr	1	" Then I saw your sister .
tr	2	He looked at Scott Lyndon .
tr	1	He bit his lower lip .
tr	1	" Yes , and that 's Sidney .
tr	0	A wise old man .
tr	4	The ribbons swayed gently above her .
tr	2	Good job on the breakfast !
tr	1	He says you 're obsessed with it .
tr	2	" No , silly .
tr	3	That 's more than I work ! "
tr	1	It 's what I enjoy doing .
tr	2	He looked around for her clothes .
tr	1	Anna was nearly fifteen now .
tr	4	" Soon , " she repeated .
tr	3	But that only took a minute .
tr	4	" One , " Jessica replied instantly .
tr	1	" No thanks ! "
tr	0	Anna was all about appearances .
tr	2	Was it good ? "
tr	3	" You don 't get it .
tr	2	Next year you 're going too . "
tr	1	Chelsea winning again too .
tr	1	" It 's Friday .
tr	2	Anderson loved to teach and loved history .
tr	4	Eyebrows raised , foreheads crinkled .
tr	3	I want to do something different .
tr	0	hoping he had made a mistake .
tr	4	" Please , explain , Christy .
tr	4	We just never hear about them .
tr	2	What did the kids do ? "
tr	4	There were 24 students , 32 questions .
tr	1	OK , dismissed ! "
tr	2	" I do not !
tr	0	That 's my dad , Kay ! "
tr	2	Do I drool over your dad ? "
tr	2	" Good points , " Alex said .
tr	0	This will be fun she thought .
tr	1	Kaylie kept on running for the goal .
tr	1	she chirped and popped up to help .
tr	0	and stared angrily , awaiting an answer .
tr	2	" So what are you worried about ?
tr	1	I guess so ! "
tr	3	But not this week , OK ? "
tr	0	I hate the 200 anyway !
tr	1	You 're not last in anything .
tr	3	" What is that ? "
tr	3	Wouldn 't that be sweet ? "
tr	3	" What 's that , Rick ? "
tr	4	" Gee , thanks .
tr	3	Rick had to smile at that .
tr	0	he finally got a chance to ask .
tr	1	" That sounds easy enough .
tr	0	This should help . "
tr	0	" High jump ? "
tr	1	Rick puzzled out loud .
tr	3	Isn 't it time to eat ? "
tr	3	" What about the box ? "
tr	2	Alex said , giggling .
tr	3	" The truth is out there ! "
tr	2	Someone toss me a roll .
tr	4	ET phoned home already !
tr	3	" Think about it .
tr	0	" Alexandra Williamson ! "
tr	2	The girls grumbled and nodded .
tr	0	You got a video link available ? "
tr	2	" Well , thank you ! '
tr	2	" And you look very pretty too .
tr	1	" Hmmm ... Light ?
tr	0	What can I help you with ? "
tr	0	" Uh , yeah .
tr	2	" Me too ! "
tr	1	" Isn 't it , darling ? "
tr	3	" That 's what I thought !
tr	1	Wait , it 's coming now .
tr	0	" What Mayan numbers ? "
tr	3	" Get on with it Walter ! "
tr	1	Rick broke the trance first .
tr	2	" Of course ! "
tr	2	I 'll be around .
tr	1	Christy observed rather loudly .
tr	0	They had advanced mathematics .
tr	4	I suppose time travel would require that !
tr	1	Anna submitted , jokingly .
tr	2	Jessica pronounced , giggling .
tr	0	Blank faces stared back at him .
tr	3	What could it be ?
tr	0	An actual time machine ?
tr	4	All ears suddenly turned to her expectantly .
tr	1	Definitely : ' time is critical . '
tr	1	Is it some kind of directions ?
tr	2	I 'll see you all shortly .
tr	3	Don 't be hurt by it .
tr	1	" I think 25 times .
tr	2	" Kill the lights ! "
tr	3	" That is the time stone .
tr	0	" Uh , the what ? "
tr	3	" It comes with the job . "
tr	4	The girls gathered on both sides .
tr	2	The girls giggled at the acronym .
tr	1	Christy said , amused .
tr	1	Do you think it has possibilities ? "
tr	2	" You looked it up , eh ?
tr	2	" You know me too well .
tr	2	" You would do that ?
tr	4	He looked scary and sounded even scarier .
tr	2	I know I winged you , too .
tr	4	He was carrying the open box carefully .
tr	1	" Any questions now ? "
tr	2	" Did he die , Daddy ? "
tr	3	You saw that list . "
tr	2	Relax , take a chill pill ! "
tr	0	Abby tried a different approach .
tr	0	Rick was already looking at it .
tr	3	" That , I can 't find .
tr	4	" Let me guess .
tr	1	Rick printed all the information .
tr	3	" What 's next ?
tr	4	Everyone whined and moaned .
tr	0	" Yes , amazing ! "
tr	2	" Do you know who ? "
tr	0	" Can 't say I blame you .
tr	1	Rick asked as nicely as possible .
tr	1	" You planning on buying it ? "
tr	2	" Of course not .
tr	2	I 'm not foolish ! "
tr	4	You have been most helpful .
tr	0	Rick hung up and smiled at Abby .
tr	2	Do you understand ? "
tr	1	" Yeah , I guess so .
tr	2	" Me too ? "
tr	2	Same rules apply to you , too .
tr	0	Jessica was already bored .
tr	2	" Sounds good to me ! "
tr	0	Was that really your plan ?
tr	2	Some of them were soooo cute ! "
tr	2	I 'll call you in a while .
tr	2	" I hope not .
tr	3	" Don 't call me that ! "
tr	0	Anna laughed , " Stop !
tr	0	" And immature , " said Anna .
tr	2	They don 't look so hairy either .
tr	0	Kaylie asked in shock .
tr	0	Kaylie asked no one in particular .
tr	0	he finally managed to say .
tr	1	" I like that idea . "
tr	4	Alex asked after several minutes .
tr	2	" It was still cool !
tr	3	The instructions said nothing about these features .
tr	2	" I did it , Dad !
tr	1	I did it ! "
tr	1	Christy asked , confused .
tr	3	The trophy presentation lasted longer than anticipated .
tr	2	" Old man who ? "
tr	2	" That does look like him !
tr	0	" Who 's hungry ? "
tr	0	an anxious Abby asked .
tr	0	" What a pig ! "
tr	1	" That 's enough Jess ! "
tr	1	" She 's been running too . "
tr	1	" Party pooper ! "
tr	3	Abby stuck her tongue out at him .
tr	1	" I 'm finished ! "
tr	2	" OK , how far ? "
tr	3	" Just grin at it ! "
tr	2	" OK , Daddy .
tr	2	" Everyone knows what to do ? "
tr	0	" Oh yeah ! "
tr	1	Rick looked at Abby for further instructions .
tr	2	Rick and the girls all laughed .
tr	4	Yell if anyone needs to stop .
tr	0	Set a fast pace . "
tr	2	He and Abby climbed out .
tr	0	Anna finally had her seatbelt off .
tr	2	" You , too ! "
tr	1	" You sure ? "
tr	2	" Of course I am !
tr	2	She giggled , " OK ! "
tr	0	and ran back up the stairs .
tr	2	Rick stood and pondered for a moment .
tr	3	Just what exactly did the thirteen-year-old suspect ?
tr	1	It 's my first real bikini .
tr	2	The girls giggled at him .
tr	2	He finally cooperated and got out .
tr	4	he finally asked at the desk .
tr	2	" Oh my god !
tr	4	" We found the time machine ! "
tr	2	We are going back tomorrow ! "
tr	3	Alex stuck her tongue out at him .
tr	0	I thought -- " " Chill !
tr	3	The two girls raced up the stairs .
tr	0	What happened to Amelia Earhart ?
tr	0	Was there really an Anastasia ?
tr	4	Or were we really created ?
tr	1	When did it begin ?
tr	1	" Who 's first ?
tr	1	Or is she your girlfriend ? "
tr	1	" She 's your girlfriend ! "
tr	1	Of course it 's my business !
tr	0	" How can I answer that ?
tr	2	" You called me old first ! "
tr	4	They looked at him stupefied .
tr	2	" Because I told you to . "
tr	0	" It was a sandal ! "
tr	0	Alex and Kaylie came up the stairs .
tr	2	Anna added , surprised .
tr	4	Jessica cried , rubbing her head .
tr	2	They all slowly walked back .
tr	1	A chorus of gripes and complaints ensued .
tr	1	was his stoic reply .
tr	1	Goosebumps raised instantly on their arms .
tr	1	Six puzzled expressions shot back at him .
tr	4	Alex asked when she noticed .
tr	1	His irritation halted Jessica 's reply .
tr	2	It has to go someplace ! "
tr	2	" Of course ! "
tr	0	Abby said , pacing .
tr	0	Abby was not amused .
tr	0	Abby finally asked him .
tr	2	Could it really be a. . .
tr	1	I 'm being childish !
tr	0	" Rick 's coming back ! "
tr	1	Rick turned the lantern on .
tr	4	Rick knelt down and opened the cube .
tr	1	" Um , I guess so . "
tr	1	" Authorizing Rick , I guess so .
tr	0	What 's your name ? "
tr	2	" Hi , Abby . "
tr	1	" I 'm Kaylie . "
tr	1	" Hi , Kaylie . "
tr	2	You are all good people .
tr	2	" You cannot be serious ! "
tr	0	she said , amazed .
tr	2	" About how long ? "
tr	0	Or was that a joke ? "
tr	4	T gave him an overview of Rome .
tr	1	No , I cannot , Rick .
tr	2	Can I look ? "
tr	3	Thanks , T ! "
tr	3	" Is that satisfactory , Rick ? "
tr	0	Anna grabbed her meal and sat there .
tr	2	" Really , T ? "
tr	0	Anna asked , shocked .
tr	1	I found it ! "
tr	4	she yelled , bursting with excitement .
tr	2	" How should I know ? "
tr	0	Who is he usually with ? "
tr	0	" Who does his hair ?
tr	2	" No , Kaylie , nobody has .
tr	1	she said , instead of complaining .
tr	2	" Oh bull ! "
tr	3	Rick thought a moment , fuming slightly .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	1	" Figures , " Rick sighed .
tr	3	said Christy , standing a little taller .
tr	4	" Because we can help ? "
tr	2	Who found out about the world ending ?
tr	2	" Not you too , Abby ? "
tr	4	Everyone stared angrily at him .
tr	4	He still didn 't agree .
tr	2	The girls were all diligently working .
tr	1	" I might ! "
tr	1	" No catch , " she insisted .
tr	2	Good plan too , I think . "
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	3	We 'll try that .
tr	4	We 're trying to save the world .
tr	3	That doesn 't sound right . "
tr	4	Like you 're my father ! "
tr	0	Rick added a menacing glare .
tr	3	That is the default setting .
tr	1	Jessica complained , disappointed .
tr	0	It was a beautiful , sunny day .
tr	0	Alex and Kaylie shot her angry glares .
tr	4	Who goes there ? "
tr	4	He stood a mere five feet tall .
tr	0	She looked much healthier though .
tr	1	she said with a bright smile .
tr	2	And who do you travel with ?
tr	2	" No , of course not ! "
tr	3	Titus can 't even do that . "
tr	1	" Hi , I 'm Rick .
tr	1	She just stared blankly .
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	2	" Oh , I 'm so sorry .
tr	0	" That 's a good idea .
tr	3	Wouldn 't that be nice ?
tr	4	Alex accepted the offer gladly .
tr	3	" Just pay attention , OK ? "
tr	2	Awww , he 's so cute !
tr	0	she was half crying through her explanation .
tr	1	" She 's lying ! "
tr	3	Christy casually pointed out .
tr	0	Alex asked again , impatiently .
tr	4	" She never wastes candles !
tr	3	" We want you to have it .
tr	4	her tears flowing freely now .
tr	1	" This cannot continue now , Rick .
tr	0	Abby stared in amazement .
tr	3	" What is that ? "
tr	3	I can 't worry like that ! "
tr	1	Jessica asked , confused .
tr	0	Alex 's words cut through him .
tr	0	" Go away ! "
tr	1	" No , I 'm just mad .
tr	0	Not fair at all ! "
tr	1	But we will make it fair .
tr	2	All of us . "
tr	2	" Sounds good to me . "
tr	4	Alex asked , interrupting their exchange .
tr	3	" Tell them what ? "
tr	2	" How does that work ? "
tr	0	" What about the natural cave ?
tr	1	" I can do it !
tr	2	No problem at all .
tr	2	Rick nodded his approval .
tr	0	Anna was closer and grabbed it .
tr	1	" I will , " she said .
tr	2	" Me too ! "
tr	2	They quickly dried off and dressed .
tr	2	Really , I 'm OK .
tr	0	Abby stared blankly at him .
tr	0	Or was it a dream at all ?
tr	1	Christy and Jessica both shrieked .
tr	2	" I might as well help .
tr	0	He threw his hands up in frustration .
tr	4	She then rifled through some papers .
tr	0	" Yeah , right .
tr	0	And he made a mistake .
tr	2	It flashed and faded on .
tr	3	You might want to watch . "
tr	0	" Amazing , " Samantha commented .
tr	4	Please don 't leave us . "
tr	2	Are you going to be OK ? "
tr	2	This book is a work of fiction .
tr	2	You 're being too noisy . "
tr	1	Carlos suddenly lost his grin .
tr	2	Carlos looked around at his friends .
tr	4	Her name was Josie Winters .
tr	4	And large twin diesel engines .
tr	2	The other boys followed him .
tr	3	The sun was starting to set .
tr	3	" It 's starting to get dark .
tr	2	The other boys looked around as well .
tr	2	Josie finally looked away from the corpse .
tr	1	" What is it , Josie ? "
tr	1	" I think the girl is scared !
tr	1	" What is it , Josie ? "
tr	4	It made Kendall feel uncomfortable .
tr	2	The man looked around him .
tr	4	He slowly began to feel better .
tr	3	The man 's jaw set with determination .
tr	4	The man carefully picked it up .
tr	1	Liquid sloshed in the can .
tr	0	It was large , plastic .
tr	2	Cool to the touch .
tr	4	He opened the cooler .
tr	4	He could smell the water inside .
tr	2	One was not enough , though .
tr	3	The night desert was quiet and still .
tr	3	Then the sound of plastic .
tr	3	One of the guys must be thirsty .
tr	1	Was she seeing things ?
tr	1	Josie was suddenly scared .
tr	2	Kendall started to demand .
tr	1	" It 's him .
tr	4	" The necklace ! "
tr	2	Jimmy suddenly charged forward .
tr	0	" Stay back , man ! "
tr	1	" I mean it ! "
tr	1	He raised his hands submissively .
tr	1	The stranger turned around quickly .
tr	0	Carlos demanded , his voice cracking .
tr	0	The stranger became calm again .
tr	1	He started to raise his hands .
tr	0	The stranger looked back at Carlos .
tr	3	But this wasn 't most anything .
tr	1	Carlos wasn 't surprised .
tr	0	" What are you ? "
tr	0	" An American , " he said .
tr	3	Josie 's throat felt dry .
tr	2	" Who are you ? "
tr	1	" I 'm Mark .
tr	0	At least he wasn 't a zombie .
tr	3	This was getting stranger and stranger .
tr	4	Hazel eyes were green and brown .
tr	2	Well , almost all of them .
tr	0	Mark nodded an affirmative .
tr	1	Kendall too was suspicious .
tr	0	" A what ? "
tr	3	" I don 't do tights .
tr	2	" Good throw . "
tr	2	Okay ... groovy ? "
tr	3	" What year is that truck ? "
tr	4	Carlos leaned close to Josie and whispered .
tr	0	Josie pushed Carlos ' hand away .
tr	0	Carlos shrugged and put his phone away .
tr	2	Mark looked from Carlos to Josie .
tr	2	Confusion showed on Mark 's face .
tr	1	Mark crossed his arms over his chest .
tr	0	Josie was taking this way too calmly .
tr	4	Everyone turned to Kendall with puzzled looks .
tr	4	He covered it defensively .
tr	0	Mark gave Jimmy a skeptical look .
tr	1	His fingers stopped against plastic .
tr	2	There was close to four thousand dollars .
tr	2	Oh , more modern slang .
tr	0	He thought it was crazy himself .
tr	4	" I remember dying .
tr	1	In this case , romantic complications .
tr	0	Maria was always excited about work .
tr	0	Maria laughed and handed Mark her hairbrush .
tr	1	Maria corrected , smiling mischievously .
tr	0	" Why the fish ? "
tr	4	His face became grim .
tr	1	" Is anyone hurt ? "
tr	0	Why was he hesitating ?
tr	1	" What if I get petrified ? "
tr	3	Not that he really worried about that .
tr	1	But his wife was right .
tr	0	He was a crack shot .
tr	0	He threw down his Thompson .
tr	0	Mark began to scream .
tr	0	Carlos had reluctantly agreed to go along .
tr	3	Then they started putting their motorcycles away .
tr	1	But nothing since ? "
tr	2	Josie too had changed .
tr	1	Jimmy noticed Josie was watching Mark closely .
tr	1	No doubt checking out his bulging muscles .
tr	0	" Kesha , man ! "
tr	1	" She 's a famous musician . "
tr	0	Carlos turned to glare at Logan .
tr	2	Logan shrugged , but said nothing .
tr	3	This kid needed an attitude adjustment .
tr	3	The trio quickly exited the truck .
tr	0	A human heart - made of stone .
tr	2	" How 'd you do that ? "
tr	3	I can 't compete with that .
tr	4	He recognized it immediately .
tr	0	What are you talking about ? "
tr	1	" Died in a fire ? "
tr	4	He turned to face the kids .
tr	1	" Find anything ? "
tr	0	" I was loaded for bear . "
tr	4	Mark considered for a moment before speaking .
tr	1	" I think so .
tr	1	In a manner of speaking . "
tr	0	Then Mark had come along .
tr	4	Jimmy asked , a little condescendingly .
tr	2	" Good question , " Mark said .
tr	4	Josie clapped her hands once .
tr	1	My mom and I live alone .
tr	2	Josie turned to look at Jimmy .
tr	3	That was not the plan .
tr	2	Mark looked from Josie to Jimmy .
tr	0	" What danger ? "
tr	2	" How do you know ? "
tr	2	" What killed you ? "
tr	3	" That 's it there . "
tr	0	Another Fed in a bad suit .
tr	1	Kendall was getting suspicious .
tr	3	Something wasn 't right .
tr	0	Headquarters was quick to answer .
tr	0	Mark wasn 't much of a talker .
tr	1	Josie had tried changing tactics .
tr	3	Two didn 't make it back .
tr	0	Jimmy was glad Mark had stopped talking .
tr	4	" I need some cash . "
tr	4	Josie pointed to his bare feet .
tr	3	But it didn 't hurt .
tr	1	" And I 'm hungry .
tr	1	So pay up . "
tr	1	Josie said , shocked .
tr	4	And he kept them busy .
tr	1	But their crime fighting was waning .
tr	2	Some formed philanthropic organizations .
tr	3	Josie had attracted some attention though .
tr	2	Cletus looked Josie up and down .
tr	4	Cletus said appreciatively , elbowing Pete .
tr	0	What 's your name ? "
tr	3	And the precise flattop hair cut .
tr	1	" You 're right , girly .
tr	3	Pete didn 't like that .
tr	3	Nobody treated his best pal like that .
tr	2	Especially some scrawny , little city girl .
tr	2	No matter how good she looked .
tr	1	Jimmy was just shocked .
tr	0	Cletus had an axe .
tr	1	Mark turned to Josie and Jimmy .
tr	3	" Get in the truck .
tr	2	I 'll handle this . "
tr	4	Cletus and Pete exchanged puzzled looks .
tr	1	You are lumberjacks , right ? "
tr	0	He still had an axe that worked .
tr	1	" Another sighting , sir ! "
tr	4	" Where 'd he go ? "
tr	2	" Call up the FBI .
tr	3	Get some units to that area .
tr	1	" Yes , sir . "
tr	4	" Why are we stopping here ?
tr	2	The sun was low on the horizon .
tr	1	" I 'm going in .
tr	1	Jimmy was very surprised by this .
tr	0	The dispatcher finally came back .
tr	2	Josie knew the mall layout well .
tr	4	He did remember he hated shopping .
tr	1	This was going to be difficult .
tr	2	Josie suddenly had an idea .
tr	0	Not that her grandpa would wear sneakers .
tr	0	Jimmy was at it again .
tr	3	But he just couldn 't do it .
tr	1	" That is so gross !
tr	0	She had to admit Mark was attractive .
tr	4	Wherever that might be .
tr	1	He was running low on cash now .
tr	1	" Finally , " Jimmy said .
tr	2	They had purchased a lot of food .
tr	3	And three thirty-two ounce soft drinks .
tr	1	" Anything ring a bell ? "
tr	2	" I got you a Coke .
tr	1	Jimmy said , snapping his fingers .
tr	1	Jimmy then started unwrapping his burger .
tr	1	" Corn syrup - it 's cheaper .
tr	2	" What 's wrong ? "
tr	2	Jimmy asked around a mouthful of food .
tr	2	Josie almost choked on her food .
tr	3	" Not at the Mall ! "
tr	4	Josie rolled her eyes .
tr	4	They 'd sure had this conversation before .
tr	1	Jimmy gave her a smug look .
tr	2	If only he could recall it .
tr	0	It was a dragon .
tr	4	Glowing red , with yellow eyes .
tr	1	" My memory 's coming back .
tr	3	" That 's great ! "
tr	1	An incoming call from an unknown party .
tr	2	" It 's for you ... ? "
tr	1	Mark raised an eyebrow , surprised .
tr	1	" It 's some guy .
tr	2	The word did sound familiar .
tr	1	And not in front of civilians . "
tr	0	" Stay calm , " Mark said .
tr	1	He set his drink down slowly .
tr	2	Mark looked over at her slowly .
tr	3	He sat up straight , back stiff .
tr	1	Josie didn 't like it .
tr	3	But that would just hurt Jimmy .
tr	1	" His girl ? "
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	3	Then it faded out .
tr	2	Josie also was wondering what to do .
tr	2	He spoke slowly , and calmly .
tr	2	Mark took one step toward Cooper .
tr	1	Josie didn 't find that funny .
tr	1	For Josie , it was surprisingly painful .
tr	4	Then he grabbed the taser .
tr	1	His nose and mouth burned .
tr	1	His chest was now on fire .
tr	1	Her vision was blurry .
tr	0	And black leather pants .
tr	2	" Oh , good grief .
tr	4	Adepts hated to be questioned or mocked .
tr	0	And she was all about the money .
tr	3	" What 's next ? "
tr	2	The ground shook slowly .
tr	1	" Refreshing , " Mark said .
tr	2	" Now what ? "
tr	1	" I surrender ! "
tr	0	It was a dark blue one .
tr	4	It made no sense .
tr	4	Or they would be replaced .
tr	0	Campbell barked at the Airman .
tr	2	It was the hood of some sedan .
tr	1	Josie was saying something .
tr	0	Jimmy shook his head .
tr	1	Now Josie was wearing a bikini .
tr	0	And her hair was once again long .
tr	1	Massaging her neck and shoulders .
tr	1	He was once again shirtless .
tr	4	They were all on a beach .
tr	1	" Jimmy , " Josie said .
tr	1	" Jimmy , " Josie said .
tr	2	Jimmy suddenly looked back up .
tr	1	Josie was pointing a pistol at him .
tr	0	Then she shot him .
tr	4	" Where are we ?
tr	3	Outside the truck it was night .
tr	3	But , man , that hurt ! "
tr	2	Good , Jimmy thought .
tr	1	What did I miss ?
tr	1	" They 're tracking us from orbit .
tr	0	Or maybe with a ghost walker . "
tr	1	" Anything you can 't do ? "
tr	2	That definitely didn 't sound good .
tr	2	" Oh , c 'm on !
tr	2	" How can you be so sure ?
tr	1	This was making no sense .
tr	1	With their hearts ripped out and missing .
tr	3	But this was something different .
tr	1	It was an easy process .
tr	0	And at least a quart of sweat .
tr	4	They 'd be sore in the morning .
tr	1	An elderly woman in a nightgown .
tr	2	The Colonel had absolutely forbidden that plan .
tr	3	Who wouldn 't get tired .
tr	1	" In position ? "
tr	0	Atlas asked into the radio .
tr	3	" Target down . "
tr	0	Atlas was back on his feet now .
tr	3	Fists might not be enough .
tr	4	Then its head exploded .
tr	0	The giant held his ground .
tr	4	he asked the giant .
tr	2	Blood no longer dripped out of it .
tr	0	And made him very angry .
tr	1	He was rapidly losing consciousness .
tr	0	He reached out with his mind .
tr	2	This one would do .
tr	2	The dragon suddenly attacked .
tr	1	His vision was now growing dark .
tr	0	That clinched it - Mark was crazy .
tr	1	Josie was impressed as well .
tr	2	" A lot of work . "
tr	2	" How are you so strong ? "
tr	2	What could they possibly do ?
tr	1	Give the dragon indigestion ?
tr	4	" Shapeshifter , remember ?
tr	0	" Anybody can be a hero . "
tr	1	Josie asked , ignoring Jimmy .
tr	2	" How can you know that ? "
tr	1	" Politicians never listen to us .
tr	3	" That 's just stupid .
tr	0	It was Major Campbell again .
tr	0	And a plan . "
tr	1	That 's my mirror ! "
tr	1	First his girl , now his truck .
tr	1	Josie asked , surprised .
tr	3	That 's their job . "
tr	1	I 'll be outside , waiting . "
tr	1	" I promise . "
tr	1	And her nervous companion , Jimmy .
tr	4	He too had noticed the approaching teens .
tr	2	she finally blurted out .
tr	3	" That hurts ! "
tr	2	Jimmy looked over at Josie .
tr	4	Another Agent was inside the elevator .
tr	0	He was ready for a rematch .
tr	1	Jimmy winced at the pain .
tr	2	Agent Williams suddenly looked alarmed .
tr	0	Agent Williams ' hand .
tr	1	" It 's him !
tr	0	For a human she wasn 't bad .
tr	1	Shoot first , ask questions later .
tr	0	She dashed through it .
tr	2	The cord was too short .
tr	4	Something was very wrong in the basement .
tr	2	Blood dripped from his hands .
tr	0	Finch turned his head slowly .
tr	4	" There you are ! "
tr	1	Finch said into her ear .
tr	4	He immediately shoved Josie aside .
tr	2	" Trying to stall , Colonel ? "
tr	2	" This body only knew so much .
tr	0	What are you ? "
tr	3	They built temples and monuments to him .
tr	2	His food loved him .
tr	0	Then , they had all vanished .
tr	0	The man had a companion .
tr	0	A land called America .
tr	0	The human did know how to fight .
tr	2	He still had plenty of lives left .
tr	1	" Running out of air ? "
tr	0	He began to transform again .
tr	3	Fire began to swell in its throat .
tr	4	Suddenly , the dragon 's eyes opened .
tr	2	Two were knocked into the pool .
tr	2	Bullets began to fly .
tr	2	Or I 'll kill this man ! "
tr	1	" Put your hands up ! "
tr	0	" And I have a gun . "
tr	1	But enough was enough .
tr	2	" I will consume you both ! "
tr	1	The dragon now only had one wing .
tr	1	Of course his wing was still severed .
tr	4	The shapeshifter 's heart was torn free .
tr	1	Josie began firing her pistol .
tr	1	Pain flared in his chest .
tr	4	She couldn 't believe Jimmy was gone .
tr	0	She saw Mark staring at her .
tr	3	But it just keeps growing back . "
tr	0	Another black suited agent approached .
tr	1	Her throat was very dry .
tr	4	She stepped away from him .
tr	0	It was a heart .
tr	3	The coyote bit into the heart .
tr	1	Josie was worried during all this time .
tr	4	" Where are they taking him ? "
tr	3	They finally stopped at B-3 .
tr	3	The light was almost too bright .
tr	1	" This is where I live . "
tr	1	" You are , sir . "
tr	0	His face was now slack , pale .
tr	1	Josie said , surprised .
tr	4	" I 'm a teenager !
tr	0	I just graduated high school .
tr	1	Josie said , astonished .
tr	1	" Me too , " Jimmy said .
tr	1	Jimmy was still stunned by the kisses .
tr	1	Josie turned around , grinning broadly .
tr	2	Josie looked down at Jimmy 's chest .
tr	0	She ran her hand over his skin .
tr	1	Jimmy and Josie said in unison .
tr	1	Josie gripped Jimmy 's hand tighter .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , Jimmy .
tr	2	" You 'll feel cold .
tr	0	" There 's nothing wrong with him !
tr	4	They couldn 't help themselves .
tr	1	Jimmy 's skin began to turn gray .
tr	2	It too was made of gray stone .
tr	2	" What did you do ? "
tr	2	" Why wasn 't I - ? "
tr	1	Available now in digital and print editions !
tr	1	Available now in digital and print editions !
tr	1	William Cunningham was assisting with the surgery .
tr	0	Toby also had a massive disability .
tr	1	CHAPTER TWO " William , come in .
tr	1	Victoria beamed rising to greet him .
tr	0	Ron was such a bag of wind .
tr	2	Victoria looked back at Ron doubtfully .
tr	2	Don 't worry about this for now .
tr	0	" What is your name ? "
tr	2	The room had no windows .
tr	1	What is William working on today ? "
tr	2	Sounds pretty cool to me .
tr	0	He was a workaholic .
tr	1	The change is astounding .
tr	4	How well are the accelerometer suits working ?
tr	3	The HS units adapt to it well .
tr	2	" How about a suit for Toby ?
tr	4	007 could be seen over his shoulder .
tr	4	" I am here . "
tr	1	Dealing in people trafficking ?
tr	1	I will consider this offer . "
tr	1	said William , astonished .
tr	1	said Victoria changing the subject .
tr	1	" Free Entertainment , by Victoria Cunningham .
tr	4	Please don 't read my work .
tr	0	What was it he had read ?
tr	1	" Good afternoon , Dr. Cunningham .
tr	2	You look smashing today .
tr	0	" This is actually a black shirt .
tr	1	Thinking of Alfred , Victoria shivered .
tr	1	" But why us ? "
tr	0	It was making Toby unbearable . "
tr	1	Victoria said sitting up in surprise .
tr	4	They have dozens of them . "
tr	3	It stretched to fit her perfectly .
tr	2	" Wow , that 's cool !
tr	0	What about my face ?
tr	2	" Move around some .
tr	1	Are you holding it all inside ? "
tr	2	" You 're out of shape . "
tr	0	What had happened to him ?
tr	3	It didn 't matter .
tr	4	They were all in this mess now .
tr	2	" Hello 007 ! "
tr	3	" It 's great !
tr	2	Toby stopped in wonder .
tr	2	Goodbye , 007 . "
tr	2	Good bye Toby . "
tr	0	My name is Jacob Crawford . "
tr	2	Are you coming back now ? "
tr	3	" You and I can protect them ?
tr	2	Jacob shook his head and looked down .
tr	0	Jacob smiled at him and paused .
tr	2	You 're a good boy , Toby .
tr	4	You are not telling me everything . "
tr	2	" We can protect William now .
tr	4	My birth was engineered .
tr	2	It makes William vulnerable too .
tr	2	" Oh , Toby ! "
tr	1	Please stay with us . "
tr	3	" That 's correct .
tr	4	I 'll just use the one .
tr	1	I like to watch him think . "
tr	2	William laughed out loud .
tr	2	... Who is we ? "
tr	2	I think you should come home soon .
tr	2	Talk to you soon . "
tr	2	Alfred called Ron Smith .
tr	2	" Not a problem .
tr	3	Great , thought Alfred .
tr	2	" Don 't be silly !
tr	1	" I hate surprises .
tr	1	Who is it ? "
tr	1	Good night , William .
tr	0	His hair had been blond .
tr	0	He had lost weight .
tr	2	" Victoria and Toby would know .
tr	1	William asked in disbelief .
tr	3	" I threatened to turn him in .
tr	0	It was a lucrative deal .
tr	3	Thanks to Victoria , I wasn 't .
tr	0	" I was holding her hand .
tr	1	" No , " sighed William .
tr	1	Its air conditioning was the best . "
tr	0	Had we had any contact ?
tr	0	He was not aware of unauthorized implants .
tr	4	All the rest died .
tr	0	William just stared at Jacob .
tr	0	Anyways , all of it was history .
tr	2	" You know Alfred .
tr	0	I stayed in Jakarta .
tr	0	" Maybe I 'll stay dead .
tr	1	" Good morning sunshine ! "
tr	2	" Let him cook .
tr	3	" What is that ? "
tr	1	Just drink it , " Jacob replied .
tr	0	Jacob was a freak .
tr	1	We 're scientists , not commandos . "
tr	0	We can use him as bait .
tr	1	" Sounds aggressive , " said William .
tr	2	" What are you doing outside ? "
tr	3	" Just taking a stroll .
tr	1	" You must be careful . "
tr	1	I want to avoid him .
tr	1	" Right , " said Victoria .
tr	3	Toby had pushed the question to 007 .
tr	1	" I saw him early this morning .
tr	1	Our weather radar , right ?
tr	0	Jacob and Victoria laughed .
tr	0	Toby gave then a blank stare .
tr	4	" Resume flirting mode . "
tr	2	Now be on your way !
tr	1	" Thank you Jenny .
tr	2	You 're looking dapper today . "
tr	3	" It 's for testing .
tr	0	" An admirable goal .
tr	0	Why didn 't you say something ? "
tr	2	" Well , hello guys .
tr	2	Victoria 's here too . "
tr	1	" Hi folks , " said William .
tr	1	" Sounds right , " said William .
tr	1	" You 're right .
tr	1	It 's a practical limitation .
tr	1	This software is your design . "
tr	2	" Lovely , " said William .
tr	1	Join us ; please sit down . "
tr	2	Victoria observed Jacob for a moment .
tr	4	Perhaps publicity was exactly what they needed .
tr	2	" That will help .
tr	2	Alfred rumbled out of the room .
tr	1	" Right , " said Victoria .
tr	2	Jacob silently shot Victoria a puzzled look .
tr	1	I think he planned the bombing .
tr	2	" How about Toby ! "
tr	3	Victoria called Toby to the kitchen .
tr	0	Mac was clearly a woman .
tr	3	It wasn 't a question .
tr	1	" You are unique . "
tr	3	" That 's fine too .
tr	0	She had taken over two hundred photographs .
tr	2	We 'll talk about it more tomorrow .
tr	1	" As you wish , William .
tr	1	" Hi Mac , " said William .
tr	0	He 's basically a workout dummy .
tr	1	Personal training demonstrations are all he knows .
tr	0	" What a bore .
tr	3	What 's the extra twist ? "
tr	2	It 's good money . "
tr	0	" Make it an extra 30 grand .
tr	4	The video feed was separate .
tr	2	William would like you to try .
tr	4	Every few seconds his eyes blinked .
tr	0	Alfred was in the café .
tr	2	007 slid out of the room .
tr	1	No sense in retiring poor .
tr	0	Alfred sat still , awaiting a reply .
tr	2	Would you like details ? "
tr	2	Make it soon . "
tr	0	" Welcome back , Jacob .
tr	2	" There , you look fine now .
tr	2	" Hello , William . "
tr	1	Toby and 006 looked like identical twins .
tr	4	He could feel his heart racing .
tr	4	" Yes , indeed .
tr	1	" Tom and Jerry ? "
tr	2	You know my negotiation skills .
tr	4	" You do need me . "
tr	4	Everyone but Ahmad seemed to be mute .
tr	2	" How did you deduce that ? "
tr	1	" You are an interesting young man .
tr	2	" You know Victoria ? "
tr	3	" Alfred just split them up .
tr	4	I mean , have some coffee .
tr	1	" Are you recording this ? "
tr	3	They had taken Toby .
tr	0	How can I salvage this ?
tr	3	Victoria thought it was important .
tr	0	Maybe Jacob was alive .
tr	1	I witnessed you kidnapping Toby . "
tr	3	" To the airport ? "
tr	2	" We can go to my office .
tr	1	It 's upstairs . "
tr	1	" You may call me Mohammed .
tr	3	Near the top of the stairs ? "
tr	3	" That is correct .
tr	3	Where did you get that information ? "
tr	1	Jacob was in the building .
tr	4	" We cannot see him .
tr	4	" The Eye ! "
tr	2	" So you had Jacob killed ? "
tr	0	Mohammed slammed his hand against a chair .
tr	2	" I could have told others . "
tr	0	Jacob and Victoria left the lab .
tr	3	William went to the back .
tr	4	The empty , familiar feeling returned .
tr	2	" He 's gone too . "
tr	2	" Come on , let 's go .
tr	1	" Thank you , Einstein .
tr	1	Can you find them ? "
tr	1	You guys sit tight in my office .
tr	1	" This is likely a bomb .
tr	3	" To the airport .
tr	4	I presume you 'll delete that recording .
tr	3	Just get us to the airport .
tr	0	" He was Alfred 's contact ? "
tr	1	" It 's going to be fine .
tr	2	" Well , that is simple .
tr	2	Stop fooling around . "
tr	4	Toby checked 006 's view .
tr	3	Let 's get back to NET . "
tr	2	William could pull off some strange feats .
tr	1	Is 007 driving a car ? "
tr	1	It is likely a bomb .
tr	1	William was silent for several seconds .
tr	3	They both stood to address their hosts .
tr	1	" Trust is a weakness . "
tr	2	Your protection is gone . "
tr	0	" You are a liar . "
tr	0	" Mohammed was acting alone .
tr	0	Ahmad calmly sat down .
tr	2	I was close to you .
tr	0	He appeared ready to strangle Ahmad .
tr	2	" Toby is in the lobby .
tr	1	Victoria stared at him in disbelief .
tr	0	Ahmad has no place to run . "
tr	2	Jacob slipped silently through the stairwell door .
tr	0	Ahmad had said as much .
tr	0	One friend , Frank , was available .
tr	0	He shook his head .
tr	0	" And a lager . "
tr	1	The next morning it was raining .
tr	2	" Good boy . "
tr	1	David tousled his son 's hair .
tr	1	" It sucks . "
tr	0	His mother frowned at him .
tr	2	David grinned at her .
tr	0	John pulled his head into the car .
tr	1	" I 'm starving , Mom .
tr	3	What 's there to eat ? "
tr	1	" Want your first beer ? "
tr	2	" David , yes . "
tr	4	" There were no horses . "
tr	3	You got ta see this ! "
tr	0	John ran back to the car .
tr	2	John literally jumped in delight .
tr	0	David looked at Sarah .
tr	0	John met them on the porch .
tr	1	" And only one bed .
tr	4	Two easy chairs faced the fireplace .
tr	1	He began to fiddle with its dials .
tr	2	" I booked a two-bedroom cottage . "
tr	0	Sarah looked at him .
tr	2	" Do we have an option ? "
tr	4	I have a phone number . "
tr	3	It was cold in the little cottage .
tr	2	" David , " she murmured .
tr	0	" I 'll make breakfast . "
tr	1	" Thanks , Mom . "
tr	3	John turned up the TV .
tr	4	" There 's been a. . .
tr	1	an incident or something .
tr	2	John , go out and play . "
tr	1	Sarah wrapped her arms around her boy .
tr	0	She hugged him tightly .
tr	1	" Which cities ? "
tr	2	I couldn 't tell .
tr	1	The Irish newscasters didn 't know .
tr	2	" Come to me , son ! "
tr	0	" What the hell , David ? "
tr	0	" What was that big flash ? "
tr	0	" Sarah , calm down .
tr	2	Let 's all just calm down . "
tr	2	Everything looked so normal now .
tr	0	Sarah held out her hand to him .
tr	3	The car wouldn 't start .
tr	2	" Do you know something ? "
tr	0	Sarah gaped at him .
tr	2	John 's voice shook .
tr	2	David opened the car door .
tr	2	" Come on , sport .
tr	0	As Sarah jumped out of the car .
tr	2	For a moment , no one spoke .
tr	3	" Was that us getting bombed ? "
tr	3	So that day they walked into town .
tr	0	Sarah wanted to slap her .
tr	0	" Have you heard from him ? "
tr	0	" Or any news at all ? "
tr	0	The woman shook her head .
tr	2	David asked , looking about the store .
tr	2	Have you looked ? "
tr	1	" Unless it 's yourselves . "
tr	4	" Likely that would be the Kennedys .
tr	0	" How much for this lantern ? "
tr	4	" What , sweetie ? "
tr	2	We read about it in school .
tr	0	" How about a hamburger ? "
tr	0	Sarah walked ahead of David .
tr	1	He was thin and young and dirty .
tr	1	" I 'm tired , Mom . "
tr	1	" Nuclear radiation did this ? "
tr	3	" But it will take time . "
tr	2	She looked at him for confirmation .
tr	1	" Aw , Mom . "
tr	0	" Sarah , no . "
tr	3	You get that , right ?
tr	4	He looked up at her .
tr	3	" That might take months . "
tr	4	She looked at the huge pasture .
tr	3	" Lotta help that is ! "
tr	3	He started to grin .
tr	0	" Are you guys okay ? "
tr	1	John asked , frowning .
tr	0	Sarah said , still laughing .
tr	1	John revisited his rickets question .
tr	2	" Look , " his mother said .
tr	2	Tomorrow we 'll go looking .
tr	1	This is all so difficult . "
tr	0	At least we have a roof . "
tr	4	She knew there was nothing to see .
tr	4	He held the reins to the pony .
tr	2	You have to actually control him . "
tr	2	Up you go , sport . "
tr	0	She approached John and his pony .
tr	2	I 'm ready to go ! "
tr	3	David trotted over to them .
tr	2	" No problem . "
tr	2	" Come on , sport .
tr	0	She thought she could smell it .
tr	0	" Relax , Sarah .
tr	2	How about you ? "
tr	2	" I hope so . "
tr	4	Was the house still there ?
tr	2	Finn lazily beckoned to him to approach .
tr	1	No one had given him a hand .
tr	3	David trotted back to her .
tr	2	" Hello , " David said .
tr	1	The man said nothing .
tr	0	What a handsome boy !
tr	2	Come in all of you . "
tr	2	She laughed loudly and winked at John .
tr	0	Sarah could smell bread baking .
tr	0	About the war , you mean ? "
tr	3	Sarah noticed the interior light was out .
tr	2	Sarah looked around the room .
tr	0	" Do you have a car ? "
tr	0	" A car ? "
tr	2	" Not for ages now .
tr	3	She brought the teapot to the table .
tr	0	She handed the mug to Sarah .
tr	0	Sarah drained her tea mug .
tr	1	Finn said , raising his voice .
tr	3	" We 'll sort it out .
tr	3	Is there anything to eat ?
tr	1	I 'm starving . "
tr	4	" When will that be ready ? "
tr	2	" Have a spoonful of this . "
tr	3	" Without bread ? "
tr	3	They had no butter .
tr	0	" I made a rabbit trap . "
tr	4	She paused for a moment remembering that .
tr	2	She did used to do that .
tr	1	Unless you count me .
tr	0	What if they have him ? "
tr	1	Sarah didn 't bother replying .
tr	0	Damn horses , she thought .
tr	2	" Dad 's got him .
tr	2	" How come ? "
tr	2	John moved out of her hug .
tr	4	She steadied herself with a long breath .
tr	3	It matches the brand at Cairn Cottage .
tr	3	" That 's nice . "
tr	4	We 've got sheep , now . "
tr	2	" Good logic , " she said .
tr	0	" The wool , " Sarah said .
tr	2	Mom knows how to knit . "
tr	0	CHAPTER SEVEN They had caught a rabbit .
tr	2	John looked up at him .
tr	0	David looked up at Sarah .
tr	3	" They all know that ? "
tr	1	John turned to her and grinned .
tr	0	" Uh huh , " John said .
tr	1	" And trust our Shepherd ? "
tr	2	He looked at his Dad .
tr	2	" Did he have dogs ? "
tr	3	It 's just one night . "
tr	2	" Are you okay , Mom ?
tr	2	You look a little nervous . "
tr	1	" Just missing Dad 's company .
tr	2	Hey , you know , Mom ? "
tr	2	John shrugged and nodded to the gun .
tr	2	She looked at him , frowning .
tr	3	" It has to go underneath . "
tr	1	" Show me , " she said .
tr	3	He took careful aim at the target .
tr	2	" What were you writing ? "
tr	1	John asked , focused on his chessboard .
tr	1	" I guess they think so .
tr	0	But John was already gone .
tr	2	She looked around for the rooster .
tr	4	He 's fine . "
tr	2	You let him do too much .
tr	3	You tend to be jittery .
tr	2	" You got ta come ! "
tr	0	Sarah grabbed his arm .
tr	4	We have to protect the sheep . "
tr	2	David decided to join them .
tr	1	My flock of sheep , in fact .
tr	3	He 'd gotten used to that .
tr	3	" Is that true ?
tr	3	They only attack at night ? "
tr	2	David realized he had no idea .
tr	0	Sarah gaped at him .
tr	4	( He 'd named the goat . )
tr	3	They 're too stupid to be afraid .
tr	2	Not a dingo or something wild .
tr	3	But then I found these little guys .
tr	4	" One died on the way back .
tr	2	" Oh , David . "
tr	2	He looked half asleep still .
tr	4	" ' Morning , sweetie . "
tr	2	" Did you wash your hands ? "
tr	3	" What 's the point ?
tr	1	Sarah 's morning had not gone well .
tr	4	Be at peace now .
tr	1	Oh , this is nonsense .
tr	4	Had the fence been deliberately broken ?
tr	3	The dog had its neck slit .
tr	2	Why would someone kill a dog ?
tr	0	" Based on what ? "
tr	0	" Go away . "
tr	0	John approached with the shovel .
tr	4	" He makes me nervous . "
tr	1	Wake up , you stupid sod ! "
tr	0	" But which ones ? "
tr	3	That was her moment .
tr	2	So I don 't know . "
tr	0	" He had John .
tr	3	" It just went bad .
tr	2	" I loved him , too . "
tr	4	CHAPTER TWELVE They needed more bullets .
tr	0	Sarah stopped and looked at him .
tr	2	" Then I 'll go . "
tr	1	I think I can handle it . "
tr	0	Sarah tacked up Dan .
tr	0	Did he have children of his own ?
tr	4	" Or we could just leave . "
tr	0	" Why would you stay here ? "
tr	2	Siobhan addressed the crowd .
tr	1	She knew what she was missing .
tr	0	The woman spoke again .
tr	0	Sarah looked back at her .
tr	0	Bad weather was moving in .
tr	0	Why do we Americans say that ?
tr	4	" Help me ? "
tr	2	" Are you looking for Devon ? "
tr	2	Obviously , I know .
tr	1	I 'm in his cottage .
tr	0	" And you are ... ? "
tr	3	" That 's right . "
tr	2	Donovan shook his head .
tr	0	" Maybe a heart attack ?
tr	0	He waved a hand at the cottage .
tr	2	Donovan waved her off .
tr	2	There 'll be no moon tonight . "
tr	0	She hated how she had acted .
tr	0	" Being American and all . "
tr	1	" Is it just Herself ? "
tr	0	Gavin made a face and hesitated .
tr	4	They are tough and resourceful . )
tr	4	We are surviving very well .
tr	2	John climbed out of bed .
tr	1	" I guess I was . "
tr	4	" Someone will know where she lives .
tr	1	" You 're right .
tr	2	Did she think they would find David ?
tr	2	Could it really be that simple ?
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	0	" And saw him ? "
tr	2	" But he 's still alive . "
tr	2	he asked , still laughing .
tr	3	" That 's beautiful . "
tr	0	Her head hurt badly .
tr	3	" Just to sit up . "
tr	2	she said , trying to look around .
tr	2	" How long was I out ? "
tr	4	She eased her helmet off .
tr	1	" Is it far ? "
tr	2	" Do you think ? "
tr	2	Now go to sleep . "
tr	2	I cut their wool off too .
tr	2	Poor John is so worried .
tr	3	Isn 't that weird ?
tr	0	John tossed the brush on the couch .
tr	0	I can always wash the brush .
tr	1	" We brought Christmas dinner . "
tr	1	David licked his lips in agony .
tr	2	Had they come looking for him ?
tr	0	What had he been thinking ?
tr	4	She begged his advice .
tr	1	She had wept for his loss .
tr	4	Did he even question it ?
tr	1	A damsel in distress .
tr	2	David smiled and extended his hand .
tr	0	" Okay , great , thanks . "
tr	2	David looked at Julie .
tr	3	" Was that part true ?
tr	1	She indicated the kitchen chair again .
tr	2	And you 'll be called ? "
tr	0	She always called him Danny .
tr	0	The thought surprised her .
tr	3	It wasn 't a question .
tr	2	" I can do both . "
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	2	" Did he ? "
tr	0	Oh , he had a tongue .
tr	2	David 's stomach growled .
tr	1	" I can 't do anything .
tr	2	Did I do right , Danny ?
tr	3	" Water , Betta .
tr	4	His brain seemed to have stopped working .
tr	1	He licked his dry lips .
tr	3	" They just left .
tr	1	" Your horse is in the barn .
tr	1	Nothing moved , no sound anywhere .
tr	2	Could he really still be alive ?
tr	0	God help me , she thought .
tr	4	He watched the flames in the fireplace .
tr	3	Sarah thought about it .
tr	2	David did reflect more than she did .
tr	1	" Life is what it is .
tr	0	Sarah looked at her and nearly laughed .
tr	3	And most of the time ?
tr	1	" Or the arrogance ? "
tr	1	It 's dinner now . "
tr	2	" Did you wash you hands ? "
tr	2	Me , too . "
tr	2	John looked at her and nodded .
tr	0	" Who is he ? "
tr	0	He 's daft as a loon .
tr	2	Should we tell Finn ? "
tr	2	" I 'll be back by nightfall .
tr	2	She looked at John .
tr	2	Be careful is all .
tr	2	" Dear Lord , " she said .
tr	2	The boy looked around the room .
tr	0	His arm hurt him today .
tr	0	It was nearly his favorite part .
tr	0	Sarah found Seamus in the back bedroom .
tr	4	" You ... You remember me ? "
tr	2	she asked , looking about the room .
tr	2	He looked out the window .
tr	2	she asked looking around the room .
tr	1	" I left my glasses . "
tr	2	In your bedroom ? "
tr	4	The voices were louder now .
tr	1	" I just saw her . "
tr	0	Sarah looked at him blankly .
tr	0	Sarah looked back at the man .
tr	2	Out you go , now . "
tr	1	He pulled out a shotgun .
tr	1	But nothing was broken .
tr	3	Tonight was for celebration , she thought .
tr	0	You guys okay ? "
tr	1	" Aren 't you surprised ?
tr	0	About Seamus , I mean ? "
tr	3	" So ... it won 't last ?
tr	1	His being lucid like this ? "
tr	3	She sat down at the table .
tr	1	He hurried Gavin to finish the loading .
tr	0	What the hell is she doing ? "
tr	1	They gave no indication of it .
tr	0	I can do this , she thought .
tr	1	What kind of nightmare am I living ?
tr	4	They 're pretty done for .
tr	0	He turned back to Sarah .
tr	0	" They had his horse .
tr	1	She 's talking about Finn .
tr	0	She 's the one shot him . "
tr	3	" Is that true ? "
tr	2	" Do you know them ? "
tr	0	A natural leader is our Finn .
tr	0	He turned back to Sarah .
tr	0	" He ... shot them ?
tr	0	And Dan came to a halt .
tr	0	Sarah approached the cottage .
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	4	Her eyes never left the cottage .
tr	1	... And then they would know .
tr	3	Is that alright ? "
tr	2	Maybe in an hour or so . "
tr	2	It was all she could do .
tr	4	Something inside her just knew .
tr	2	Thank you , God .
tr	2	" What news ? "
tr	1	Donovan said to his sister .
tr	4	" There 's news ? "
tr	2	Donovan took in a big sigh .
tr	0	" That maybe help was coming ? "
tr	2	Donovan shook his head .
tr	3	" What I intend to do ? "
tr	1	" We 're building a community .
tr	0	Why would you stay ? "
tr	2	She looked at Donovan .
tr	2	Not by a long shot . "
tr	2	" So you 'll help me ? "
tr	0	They 're survivors , she thought .
tr	4	One of the men stepped forward .
tr	2	Donovan shook his head .
tr	0	We could have left , Sarah thought .
tr	2	" How long to rebuild ? "
tr	0	" About what happened .
tr	2	" Dad called it . "
tr	0	Sarah smiled at him .
tr	2	John looked up from grooming his dog .
tr	0	Sarah looked at him .
tr	1	" Until we find him . "
tr	1	How was that possible ?
tr	2	Sarah moved over to give her room .
tr	1	Why not end it now ? "
tr	1	Mike wasn 't too specific . "
tr	2	" I was hoping you would . "
tr	1	" Shoot , " she said .
tr	1	" A riding accident .
tr	1	She was brilliant , so she was .
tr	1	" In a competition .
tr	3	Went to bed that night .
tr	1	Sarah turned back to her horse .
tr	3	That 's what communities do . "
tr	3	" I absolutely want that .
tr	3	" It 's the same thing . "
tr	3	" Tell me how it isn 't !
tr	2	Donovan took a step back .
tr	3	" Let 's forget it , okay ?
tr	0	Donovan waved away her words .
tr	0	That was a shocker .
tr	2	The boy looked nervous to Finn .
tr	1	" Is he talking ? "
tr	4	They turned when he came in .
tr	4	But there was something else about him .
tr	1	" I just know I am . "
tr	1	By any means possible .
tr	2	" Your boy doing okay ? "
tr	3	" I 'm not thinking that . "
tr	3	" Something like that . "
tr	2	" Growing up fast .
tr	2	" How so ? "
tr	0	Sarah picked her plate back up .
tr	3	No , it 's not that .
tr	4	He looked at her sadly .
tr	0	" How much do we have ? "
tr	1	" Is it very much ?
tr	2	Mr. Donovan said so . "
tr	0	Sarah turned and looked at Donovan .
tr	3	" I did not say that . "
tr	2	" Of course . "
tr	3	" Except that . "
tr	3	" Pull that national shite on me .
tr	1	This is not an epic poem .
tr	0	Donovan sighed heavily and looked away .
tr	1	Finn roared to his men .
tr	2	The plan was easy if not foolproof .
tr	0	Sarah sat quietly atop Dan .
tr	2	" Whoa , sport .
tr	4	He seemed fine with the suggestion .
tr	3	That 's thanks to you . "
tr	2	" Do I look worried ? "
tr	1	He wasn 't moving .
tr	3	John sat next to her .
tr	2	" You okay , Mom ? "
tr	1	" It is . "
tr	1	" Is he in much pain ? "
tr	1	Fiona smiled at her as she passed .
tr	2	" How you doing ? "
tr	1	Gypsies are famous cowards . "
tr	1	" This isn 't a movie .
tr	2	Sarah nodded and watched him with concern .
tr	1	" So , " she said .
tr	1	Yes , that 's sensible .
tr	2	Donovan looked at her .
tr	2	Donovan took a moment to speak .
tr	0	" I mean it , Sarah .
tr	2	" So you know .
tr	3	That information made her start .
tr	2	To find David ? "
tr	1	To find Finn . "
tr	3	" Shoot the bastard .
tr	4	Where the shite was that bloody Brendan ?
tr	2	Aidan and Jimmy rode behind her .
tr	3	It was totally quiet .
tr	2	He 'd obviously given it some thought .
tr	0	David nearly laughed in his face .
tr	1	Why not make it a million ?
tr	1	Just bring ' er . "
tr	0	" The bastards are getting away ! "
tr	3	That 's my fault , she thought .
tr	0	Did that mean he was still alive ?
tr	2	" You did . "
tr	1	Brendan looked back at Finn .
tr	2	" I could go back out there .
tr	0	Finn looked at Sarah and smiled .
tr	2	" Mom , you okay ? "
tr	2	He looked around the room .
tr	1	She had screwed this up so badly .
tr	2	" You okay , Mom ? "
tr	1	" You 're breathing funny . "
tr	2	" I coulda , though , Mom .
tr	2	" It 's a five foot drop .
tr	0	Mack Finn was framed in the doorway .
tr	2	" Well , well .
tr	1	Finn turned back to him .
tr	0	" Or what , Yank ? "
tr	1	Your brother was hurting my boy . "
tr	3	That is not what happened .
tr	0	It all happened so fast .
tr	1	" No , missus ! "
tr	0	" Check him , " she said .
tr	1	" Name 's Mick . "
tr	2	" Move to the front door .
tr	2	Don 't touch the doorknob . "
tr	0	Why was the bastard smiling at her ?
tr	2	You got ' im ! "
tr	2	" How are you doing ? "
tr	1	" Don 't shoot , missus !
tr	4	What are you doing here ? "
tr	1	He and Gavin often came to dinner .
tr	1	" Waiting for Uncle Mike ? "
tr	4	" You 'll freeze out here . "
tr	0	Sarah shook her head .
tr	0	She cupped his cheek with her hand .
tr	4	It just gets worse from here . "
tr	2	" Me , too . "
tr	2	David leaned over and took her hand .
tr	0	Sarah looked at him and smiled .
tr	1	" Your news always sucks . "
tr	1	" News about the crisis ? "
tr	3	" That it is . "
tr	1	" So what is the news ? "
tr	0	Sarah asked , ignoring David .
tr	2	You 're too hard on him . "
tr	0	He looked at Sarah and smiled .
tr	4	She turned away from the pasture .
tr	2	" Don 't you know ? "
tr	2	" Of course I followed you .
tr	2	You know what my provocation was . "
tr	2	Valerian stamped his booted foot and swore .
tr	3	" What of the Stygian ? "
tr	0	She laughed at him .
tr	2	You know that , too . "
tr	2	" Don 't be a fool ! "
tr	1	" I can if I choose . "
tr	0	" Keep back , you barbarian dog !
tr	3	She knew it was the truth .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	1	" Lions are slaying the horses ! "
tr	1	" Lions , nothing ! "
tr	2	Watch , now ! "
tr	0	The sight sent panic racing through him .
tr	0	She shook her head .
tr	3	" I thought of that .
tr	2	" Sit still and calm down .
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	1	" Is she running away ? "
tr	4	We 'll make for the city !
tr	1	After me , in a hurry ! "
tr	3	It 's the city or nothing now !
tr	2	Instantly a horrible roar shook the woods .
tr	2	" It 's touch and go now .
tr	3	" Skin your teeth in that pear .
tr	2	I may be too , some day .
tr	0	Why shouldn 't I ? "
tr	1	I do not like this city . "
tr	1	Vision did not extend beyond that ring .
tr	3	" But who built it ?
tr	2	Why did they abandon it ? "
tr	0	" Who can say ?
tr	3	It doesn 't look like Stygian architecture .
tr	4	" Can we open the gate ?
tr	2	Let 's look around .
tr	3	That bolt 's freshly broken .
tr	3	Rust has eaten nearly through it .
tr	4	" We 'll never know .
tr	4	Look at these friezes .
tr	1	Let 's go up those stairs . "
tr	0	A woman was stealing along the hall .
tr	1	Her curved sword lay near him .
tr	4	They gave up no secret .
tr	4	Suddenly another figure entered the grim drama .
tr	2	" Who are you ?
tr	0	The boy heard nothing .
tr	2	Do not even look at it !
tr	2	" Do not look at the skull !
tr	2	Do not look at the skull ! "
tr	2	" Five dead dogs ! "
tr	2	The gods of blood be thanked ! "
tr	1	Valerian shrugged his shoulders .
tr	4	Maybe we 'd better go with her .
tr	2	They will honor you !
tr	2	" Crom knows ! "
tr	4	He feared no woman .
tr	2	" No squares nor open courts .
tr	2	We call it the Halls of Silence .
tr	1	The darkness was absolute .
tr	4	The hallway seemed interminable .
tr	4	After me , quick !
tr	1	I think I cut it asunder .
tr	3	" But wait ! "
tr	4	" You can never reach the coast !
tr	1	Her dusky skin went ashy .
tr	3	" What 's the matter ?
tr	0	What are you gaping about ? "
tr	4	" Five years they dwelt in peace .
tr	4	Half a century the feud has endured .
tr	1	I was born in it .
tr	1	Valerian listened with morbid fascination .
tr	1	This feud is none of our business .
tr	2	" Who is Olmec ? "
tr	0	" What are you talking about ? "
tr	0	" That man is beautiful and young .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	3	" That one ? "
tr	2	" Who spoke of fear ? "
tr	0	What 's your game ? "
tr	2	" Did Olmec send you ? "
tr	2	Whom do you fear ?
tr	2	" You sulky gigolo ! "
tr	3	But he did not cry out .
tr	2	" I will tell . "
tr	2	Then I will tell you all . "
tr	0	" Oh , help !
tr	4	The other meditated for a space .
tr	3	" That racket sounds like it . "
tr	4	" The feud is ended !
tr	1	Go with the Cimmerian .
tr	2	" Are you mad , too ? "
tr	1	She is a beast .
tr	1	His slim fingers stroked her locks lightly .
tr	2	Her booming voice filled the room .
tr	2	I have endured too much from you !
tr	1	It is still in working order .
tr	2	I am not of royal blood .
tr	0	I am greater than a prince .
tr	2	" I will tell you all ! "
tr	2	" All right . "
tr	2	" Olmec took his from me .
tr	4	" And keep ahead of me .
tr	1	The first person she saw was Valerian .
tr	2	What grisly food did you find ?
tr	4	Where did these people keep their food ?
tr	3	" What matter ? "
tr	0	This 's a bad 'n alright . "
tr	3	" TV out ? "
tr	1	" Lucas ... you there Lucas ? "
tr	3	" I 'm down the stretch .
tr	3	There was another burst of static .
tr	0	Lucas saw that much was true .
tr	2	" You finish the book ? "
tr	0	So yeah , he thought .
tr	2	He could do a lot worse .
tr	2	" How do you mean ? "
tr	1	All those stories about his life .
tr	2	So , you know what I think ?
tr	0	She chuckled and shook her head .
tr	3	" But for what it 's worth ?
tr	2	" Back soon . "
tr	1	" It 's okay , pup .
tr	2	Nothin ' to be afraid of . "
tr	2	The two men shook .
tr	1	" No problem , " Quinn answered .
tr	2	Who found it ? "
tr	2	" Tell me all about it ! "
tr	4	Cobb crinkled his forehead .
tr	0	" Remarkable , " he said again .
tr	3	" After all this time . "
tr	3	Lucas thought a moment .
tr	1	" Anything I can do ? "
tr	0	Barney was always careful what he said .
tr	3	He didn 't take it out anymore .
tr	0	" That one was from Australia ! "
tr	2	Duesenberg smiled and nodded .
tr	2	Chris looked up at the professor .
tr	4	The professor beamed back at him proudly .
tr	0	" Sorry , my boy .
tr	0	Chickens and rabbits and rats .
tr	4	The men spoke in low tones .
tr	0	He was ready for anything .
tr	3	It wasn 't too late .
tr	3	Anyway , it didn 't matter .
tr	1	" I 'm hit !
tr	1	I 'm hit ! "
tr	2	He couldn 't make out a word .
tr	2	boomed a now familiar voice .
tr	3	Any truth to that ? "
tr	1	" Built my company using it .
tr	2	Seth couldn 't recall .
tr	2	Lots of room for expansion .
tr	3	None taken , Seth thought .
tr	4	Still , he needed time to think .
tr	2	Alright , son , now listen carefully .
tr	2	Have your boys look ' em over .
tr	4	" So we 're agreed .
tr	3	That 's number forty-eight in my book .
tr	3	Pickett let out a cackle .
tr	3	If you 're smart , that is .
tr	0	I can tell that about a man .
tr	1	His mind churned with possibilities .
tr	1	Not now , anyway .
tr	1	His speech wasn 't slurred .
tr	0	No , he thought .
tr	2	This won ' do .
tr	2	And oh , this be nice too .
tr	1	Chris bit his tongue .
tr	3	" Just great . "
tr	2	" Now now , me boy .
tr	0	Chris pinched himself hard .
tr	2	A snort came out of his nose .
tr	3	His body went tight .
tr	2	He didn 't dare turn around .
tr	0	The sun was high in the sky .
tr	3	" Silent and stealthy .
tr	2	" Chris Duggan . "
tr	0	" What 's your name ? "
tr	4	" What do we have here ? "
tr	1	" Anyhow , I 'll investigate .
tr	2	Do some asking around . "
tr	2	He turned to Cobb and nodded .
tr	1	" I knew it ! "
tr	1	" I knew it !
tr	2	" Knew what ? "
tr	0	" ... a national treasure ! "
tr	1	Like a historic artifact . "
tr	1	Truth was , Chris despised math .
tr	1	Smiling again , he went on .
tr	3	Chris wasn 't sure about that .
tr	2	It 's yours , you know .
tr	2	Yours and yours alone . "
tr	3	But Barney was right too .
tr	1	" I appreciate it . "
tr	3	But enough of that .
tr	2	Pretty cool , no ? "
tr	2	They 'll be world famous !
tr	2	How far have you gotten ?
tr	1	A very exciting year for immigration . "
tr	3	But he went through the motions anyway .
tr	3	They 'll take it ?
tr	3	But he had gotten something , anyway .
tr	0	Lucas was glad about that .
tr	4	Just the way he liked them .
tr	2	He was looking forward to that .
tr	0	The tallest was a beefy black man .
tr	0	Vasa and Mary Rose .
tr	0	Vasa and Mary Rose .
tr	3	Christmas at the earliest .
tr	0	Something he was already familiar with .
tr	0	What folks call me , anyway .
tr	1	The man lifted his glasses .
tr	4	What do we have here ? "
tr	3	The words meant nothing to Chris .
tr	0	" A Spanish dollar .
tr	3	Got the weight about right , anyway .
tr	1	The man went on .
tr	2	Though dazed , Chris smiled and nodded .
tr	3	No , that 's not right .
tr	1	Billy it is ! "
tr	1	Chris feared it would bark .
tr	2	" No problem . "
tr	3	The two sat down .
tr	4	He hoped the question wouldn 't offend .
tr	3	After a moment , he got it .
tr	2	" Who told you ? "
tr	4	More treasure than they ever dreamed of !
tr	1	Put it in a museum .
tr	1	Raised up Mary Rose ? "
tr	2	" Don ' matter now , laddie .
tr	3	Chris couldn 't argue with that .
tr	2	" Well , laddie .
tr	0	He held them out to Chris .
tr	4	" Take these laddie .
tr	4	You earned ' em .
tr	3	to the man at the counter .
tr	0	No , a second actually . "
tr	0	The day was warm .
tr	1	And you 're right .
tr	1	He knows how I like it . "
tr	1	" Guess who ! "
tr	1	said a voice from behind .
tr	0	Chris arched his back and pulled away .
tr	1	I didn 't mean it ! "
tr	2	She smiled and moved toward it .
tr	2	" No , you do .
tr	0	" Want a sandwich ? "
tr	0	" I 'm a vegetarian now .
tr	2	How do you feel about that ? "
tr	0	She made a face and turned away .
tr	0	Anyway , I 'm all organic now .
tr	1	" All made from hemp .
tr	3	That George Washington used to grow it ?
tr	3	And get them to understand .
tr	2	Do you know what I mean ? "
tr	0	What are you smiling about ? "
tr	3	It was her turn to smile .
tr	3	I can tell you that now .
tr	0	He blushed and closed his mouth .
tr	2	She smiled and winked and waved goodbye .
tr	1	It was just beginning , he knew .
tr	4	Fifteen , certainly no older than sixteen .
tr	4	the boy asked miserably .
tr	2	" Why are you following me ? "
tr	1	" Which one was Sykes ? "
tr	2	" The short bald fella .
tr	4	Mean one , he is . "
tr	0	" Who is he ? "
tr	0	" Hard ta explain , really .
tr	2	" Whole things a bollocks , really .
tr	2	All by himself , he was .
tr	1	It wasn 't fer Sykes .
tr	1	An on it went . "
tr	4	Worst seas I e 're encountered .
tr	1	Chris was shocked by this revelation .
tr	0	Thought they owed him that much .
tr	0	Chris had heard enough .
tr	1	" Sure 'n I was .
tr	2	The boy looked away .
tr	2	Two stacks of familiar looking coins .
tr	4	Chris knew then he was miles away .
tr	0	His hands were bound behind his back .
tr	1	Then , Billy surprised him .
tr	1	An ' yer right , of course .
tr	4	An ' punishment has been decided . "
tr	1	Heads turned in his direction .
tr	1	" Mr. Quartermaster ? "
tr	0	Mos ' fundamental law of the ship .
tr	3	" It 's community theater , right ?
tr	2	Improv of some sort ?
tr	0	" Captain was giving chase .
tr	3	" It 's true .
tr	2	Everybody knows about it .
tr	0	They had all come back .
tr	0	Sykes had sat down again .
tr	1	His opinion was known .
tr	4	" They 're deciding his fate . "
tr	0	To what , he had no clue .
tr	4	Gentlemen , please . "
tr	4	" Ale fer the men !
tr	0	All ye can spare . "
tr	1	But their singing went on .
tr	4	Otherwise , the beach was deserted .
tr	3	That was another curious thing .
tr	4	Where was the media ?
tr	2	Do a body good . "
tr	1	His patience paid off .
tr	0	" I canna let that happen .
tr	1	The professor was now in serious danger .
tr	0	" What really happened in Tortuga ? "
tr	2	" Good , laddie .
tr	1	I shoulda seen it coming .
tr	1	" I 'm fine .
tr	1	" I 'm sure of it .
tr	3	But it just might work .
tr	3	He turned to the captain .
tr	2	Chris smiled , then nodded .
tr	1	Their captain decided this was only fair .
tr	1	He was just its steward .
tr	0	Barney and the captain looked his way .
tr	0	Chris grasped the railing and held fast .
tr	2	" I told you .
tr	4	The ship had returned to the sea .
tr	2	The ranger smiled and nodded .
tr	2	Chris pinched himself and looked down .
tr	3	" What 's that ? "
tr	0	Sarah asked , pointing .
tr	0	Sarah shook her head .
tr	2	Now , look closely .
tr	4	" They 're different .
tr	2	And for the kids .
tr	2	They 're doing good .
tr	4	He really loves them .
tr	2	" What old monkey ? "
tr	1	" What is it , silly ? "
tr	1	" Nothing , " Chris replied .
tr	4	He waited a moment before asking .
tr	0	" It 's a ... yeah .
tr	3	That might be fun . "
tr	0	Dawkins , Barney 's lawyer .
tr	1	" Nothing wrong with me , son .
tr	1	Now , young man , tell us .
tr	0	Why have you brought us here ? "
tr	1	Barney was smiling and nodding .
tr	4	Even he knew it would sound crazy .
tr	0	He said it anyway .
tr	1	Canna be done . "
tr	4	Then again , times were tough .
tr	0	Angelina was crying , as usual .
tr	4	The baby belongs to Reese .
tr	2	" Goin ' well , laddie .
tr	0	But what the hell , he thought .
tr	1	It was quite vexing .
tr	1	Could a friend help a guy out ?
tr	0	What kind of work , they asked ?
tr	0	A down payment , it was called .
tr	1	" Superstore 's just across the street .
tr	3	There was no getting around it .
tr	3	But not the other .
tr	3	" What section is that ? "
tr	0	Lucas asked the manager .
tr	3	Lucas gritted his teeth .
tr	1	The chorus went on and on .
tr	2	Do you understand me ? "
tr	1	" I guess . "
tr	2	" Small world ! "
tr	0	She thought he had a cute accent .
tr	2	" So you should come with us !
tr	2	Lots and lots of rope .
tr	1	His mind raced with possibilities .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought .
tr	0	It was among his favorite days .
tr	0	That strange amalgam of accents .
tr	0	came a familiar shout .
tr	0	Hip Hip ... " " Hooray ! "
tr	1	" Having fun ? "
tr	4	Her eyes smiled back as she nodded .
tr	3	That was no way to make detective .
tr	3	But the money didn 't hurt .
tr	0	But their appearance had changed .
tr	0	Turnabout was fair play , after all .
tr	1	Hesitation equals weakness or some such thing .
tr	4	" Well , " Pickett began .
tr	2	Happens to lots of folks .
tr	2	Do you understand me ?
tr	2	" Looking forward to it ! "
tr	1	he replied , wiping it away .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought .
tr	3	The first two had arrived by boat .
tr	0	" Wow , " Sarah said .
tr	3	There 's actually some debate about that .
tr	1	" Sounds kinky , " Sarah said .
tr	1	Chris smiled too before grabbing her arm .
tr	3	Let 's check it out . "
tr	2	' Slap it lib ' rally ! '
tr	2	But Billy just smiled .
tr	0	" He 's right , ya know .
tr	3	Got ta get back ! "
tr	2	Chris took one last look around .
tr	2	" We should probably go .
tr	1	To his surprise , the man smiled .
tr	2	" Go on , " he said .
tr	3	The man got suddenly less chatty .
tr	3	" That 's right .
tr	4	Fourteen , maybe fifteen .
tr	4	Hell , I don 't remember .
tr	3	Lucas was getting impatient .
tr	0	Billy was what he said .
tr	0	Less than nothing , he thought .
tr	0	" Bastard , " he said .
tr	0	" Bastard , " it read .
tr	0	Some things never changed , Chris thought .
tr	2	What were you going to do ?
tr	0	The Rump was a small place .
tr	0	" Want a sandwich ? "
tr	2	She looked away before going on .
tr	1	Running an inn with your mother .
tr	0	Not having a father .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry .
tr	1	I have no business asking .
tr	1	He saw she was smiling .
tr	0	" Oh , yeah , that .
tr	4	Just like anywhere else , I guess .
tr	2	Who drinks too much .
tr	0	And then there 's the church .
tr	2	Anyway , home schooling is pretty cool .
tr	3	" Now , that last thing .
tr	0	And his laugh , oh boy .
tr	4	Get the hell out of bed . '
tr	3	But it helps . "
tr	1	" Thanks , " she said .
tr	2	Speaking of ... hey , look ! "
tr	4	The crew cheered that milestone .
tr	3	But he paid that no mind .
tr	1	What would happen would happen .
tr	1	Unconsciously , he started shaking his head .
tr	1	His glasses were askew .
tr	4	Maybe she 'd land on her feet .
tr	2	It was one of his confounded rules .
tr	1	Some spoke in hushed whispers .
tr	3	A long night at the Cove .
tr	4	There were easier ways to find firewood .
tr	0	Lucas looked away first .
tr	3	Maybe that was somehow connected to this .
tr	1	Any one of a thousand things .
tr	4	" No , " he answered truthfully .
tr	0	" What are you waiting for ? "
tr	3	Moments later , they both broke it .
tr	1	Chris smiled and sat up .
tr	0	Probably both , Chris thought .
tr	1	It had weighed heavily on his mind .
tr	0	Anyway , you were right .
tr	1	The rest was out of his hands .
tr	1	The ship grounding and sinking .
tr	2	So why were you coming ? "
tr	3	Is that right ? "
tr	2	He went on to detail those provisions .
tr	1	Chris smiled and promised he 'd visit .
tr	2	" Costco , " he shouted .
tr	2	Chris smiled and nodded .
tr	1	In the starlit darkness , Chris smiled .
tr	1	" Anyway , " he went on .
tr	4	The man had come from nowhere .
tr	1	Arthur showed far more self-control this time .
tr	2	You know him ? "
tr	2	Chris nodded and smiled .
tr	0	Billy smiled and took Sarah 's arm .
tr	2	~ Arthur Cobb lay in bed brooding .
tr	2	Looking over at Cobb , he smiled .
tr	2	Arthur couldn 't , but nodded anyway .
tr	1	The man went on .
tr	3	But no , that was stupid too .
tr	0	The captain nodded again .
tr	1	With a sigh , Chris climbed in .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought again .
tr	2	Nothing he could do about it now .
tr	4	" Where are we going ? "
tr	2	" Shouldn 't be too far .
tr	4	" Umm , " he answered quietly .
tr	4	Moments later , they heard barking .
tr	2	They 'd had a good run .
tr	0	And it was all because of him .
tr	0	That was pure Calvin .
tr	1	Then , surprisingly , the captain smiled .
tr	4	That had been nice .
tr	3	But it lasted only a moment .
tr	3	It could only be the captain .
tr	2	" Permission to come aboard ! "
tr	1	Permission for them ta pass . "
tr	3	But Pickett was right about one thing .
tr	1	It was time to finish this .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought .
tr	3	And that was just his own cut .
tr	0	Finally , he thought .
tr	2	" Out of sorts .
tr	1	But no , his mind insisted .
tr	2	Throw a monkey wrench into the works ?
tr	1	Nip it in the bud ?
tr	3	I 'm not here to stop anything .
tr	3	Is that correct ? "
tr	1	It 's the way I do business .
tr	0	" We appreciate that , Calvin .
tr	0	Work as a team . "
tr	1	" That is wonderful news , Calvin .
tr	2	You mentioned your book .
tr	3	Have you ever thought about it ? "
tr	3	Am I right about that . "
tr	4	Seth started feeling lightheaded .
tr	3	Write that down , Sparky ! "
tr	3	To his left , Pickett spoke .
tr	1	Barney turned to Chris .
tr	3	Everything to your satisfaction ? "
tr	4	That 's when the moon goes new .
tr	2	The boathouse lights came on too .
tr	1	It was his true pirate voice .
tr	2	The approaching boat moved closer .
tr	0	All had their guns drawn .
tr	0	Why , he had no idea .
tr	1	Mind catching this rope ? "
tr	3	There was no doubt about that now .
tr	4	" Have you been listening ?
tr	3	Just arrest them all . "
tr	0	Barney asked it again .
tr	1	" Mister Haskins , please .
tr	4	" Day before . "
tr	1	" Just word games .
tr	3	That was nice too .
tr	0	Oh well , Chris thought .
tr	0	Frustrated now , he asked it again .
tr	4	Every bit of her .
tr	1	And this ship is yours . "
tr	2	Go to court to solve it . "
tr	3	He turned to the captain .
tr	1	" This vessel is stolen property !
tr	0	Barney glanced down at his watch .
tr	2	" How do you mean ? "
tr	0	Said you were a natural .
tr	0	He could only shake his head .
tr	0	Make a good conversation piece , anyway .
tr	0	Funny how that worked , he thought .
tr	0	Oh well , he thought .
tr	0	Was that what the man said ?
tr	0	Hmm , he thought .
tr	3	Have to think about that .
tr	0	Angelina was due to have her baby .
tr	0	It was a man 's voice .
tr	0	Daylight streamed through his window .
tr	2	So look out , I !
tr	2	A word of caution , though .
tr	0	A heartwarming and life-affirming coming-of-age tale .
tr	1	First Smashwords Edition : May 2012 .
tr	2	You know who you are .
tr	1	It was smashed to pieces .
tr	1	' And a new phone . '
tr	0	He shot a hard glance at me .
tr	1	It was ten years ago this summer .
tr	2	For a while , life was good .
tr	2	I should have died that day .
tr	0	All that was left was ash .
tr	4	The road ahead was deserted .
tr	0	There was a calculated pause .
tr	0	' What about a sword ?
tr	2	You 're good with swords . '
tr	1	I looked at him steadily .
tr	0	' What about Louisiana ? '
tr	0	' Louisiana was a fluke . '
tr	1	Reid was on his fifth cigarette .
tr	2	Reid slowed down and followed .
tr	4	We were not far from the water .
tr	0	Red tail lights flashed up ahead .
tr	4	Reid turned the engine off .
tr	2	It was followed by a wild cackle .
tr	0	' Why is he laughing ? '
tr	2	' Now what ? '
tr	4	he shouted from the alley .
tr	2	The wind had picked up .
tr	2	' North-east corner of the roof ? '
tr	2	shouted Haus from the neighbouring rooftop .
tr	1	This I was certain of .
tr	2	It slid down smoothly to the ground .
tr	3	I started to climb .
tr	3	They all hit their target .
tr	0	' Cain and Abel ? '
tr	2	' Go figure . '
tr	1	He did not rise again .
tr	1	' Olsson was right .
tr	4	You 're weak , half-breed ! '
tr	4	My knees gave way beneath me .
tr	1	It was still raining .
tr	0	My name is Cain Haus .
tr	0	' Wan na talk about it ? '
tr	0	' That bad , huh ? '
tr	1	A frown marred Reid 's brow .
tr	2	A door slammed in the corridor outside .
tr	2	Olsson wrote for the Morning Post .
tr	1	Olsson was similarly shocked .
tr	2	' I 'll call Novak and Price .
tr	1	A soft sigh escaped her lips .
tr	1	she murmured , hovering by a chair .
tr	1	It looked like it was grinning .
tr	1	I indicated the picture .
tr	2	She smiled and nodded .
tr	3	I left the apartment a moment later .
tr	2	' How 're you doing ? '
tr	1	The park was divided into four sections .
tr	0	I sighed and put the bag away .
tr	4	I murmured hesitantly after several heartbeats .
tr	2	A faint chuckle followed .
tr	0	Haus already told me about you . '
tr	2	' Did he now ? '
tr	4	Glass shattered somewhere above me .
tr	0	A falling shard caught my cheek .
tr	1	' Hang on ! '
tr	1	It was an incoming call from Reid .
tr	3	' What 's that noise ?
tr	2	I turned and raced towards it .
tr	3	I had forgotten about the cat .
tr	0	' Is that an arrow ? '
tr	4	Reid 's frown deepened .
tr	2	' Copy , Control . '
tr	3	' How long did that take ? '
tr	3	' About an hour twenty minutes . '
tr	3	Just like that ? '
tr	1	' No , ' I said quietly .
tr	4	' Did he say anything else ? '
tr	4	I glanced at the sleeping cat .
tr	0	' Has it got a name ? '
tr	1	' You 're kidding , right ? '
tr	2	' Why now ? '
tr	1	Reid finally said , scowling .
tr	0	he said , glancing at me .
tr	0	He glanced at me and scowled again .
tr	1	' I wasn 't intending to . '
tr	4	' But we need more weapons . '
tr	0	I paused and glanced at the dashboard .
tr	4	Reid 's frown deepened .
tr	0	' You have a car ? '
tr	4	He knew his weapons well .
tr	4	' Then definitely leave them .
tr	0	And take your passport . '
tr	2	No one had followed us .
tr	1	I indicated the guns .
tr	0	' Take what you can carry . '
tr	1	I passed the paper across to him .
tr	1	My lips parted in a wry smile .
tr	4	Reid glanced over his shoulder .
tr	1	A larger figure appeared in the corridor .
tr	3	' This is a lotta money . '
tr	1	I looked at the rear view mirror .
tr	3	' What is it then ? '
tr	3	Reid stared down at the tin box .
tr	3	The owners liked it that way .
tr	2	Reid followed in my footsteps .
tr	0	Am I clear ? '
tr	2	' You look awful . '
tr	2	' Did you drive ? '
tr	3	' It wasn 't that bad . '
tr	2	They 're looking for something .
tr	4	Reid 's gaze shifted to me .
tr	1	A faint smile crossed his face .
tr	2	' Will he help ? '
tr	2	' So , where to now ? '
tr	2	I nodded briskly and looked ahead .
tr	3	' Put your seat belt on . '
tr	1	' I think I should drive . '
tr	1	' Investment bank ? '
tr	2	Reid frowned and shook his head .
tr	1	Not in DC , anyway . '
tr	3	It had just gone eight .
tr	1	' This personal business ? '
tr	3	' Amongst other things . '
tr	0	' What 's this about anyway ? '
tr	2	' Oh , and Soul ? '
tr	1	I smiled faintly at his tone .
tr	3	' That 's the beauty of it .
tr	1	' Probably , ' I murmured .
tr	0	' That 's an original Rembrandt . '
tr	1	' It is ? '
tr	1	' You 're kidding , right ? '
tr	1	Reid said in a shocked voice .
tr	1	' High density fire-resistant body .
tr	1	Strauss is the key .
tr	2	' You go first .
tr	2	I 'll hold them off . '
tr	4	Unspoken words filled the silence between us .
tr	1	' I 'm sorry . '
tr	2	Reid pulled away swiftly .
tr	2	' How 's your leg ? '
tr	0	We headed away from Capitol Hill .
tr	1	I waited a while .
tr	4	' I need another favour . '
tr	1	' You 're kidding , right ? '
tr	0	' Thanks , ' I said gratefully .
tr	0	The restaurant was dark .
tr	4	The old man 's eyes widened .
tr	4	he exclaimed in broken English .
tr	2	The young man looked up sharply .
tr	4	' We need them tonight . '
tr	1	I paused at his shocked expression .
tr	1	His eyebrows rose slightly .
tr	0	' Any particular reason ? '
tr	1	' You sure about this ? '
tr	1	It 's Lucas . '
tr	0	He glanced at our bags .
tr	2	' Will this be all ? '
tr	1	he said with a blindingly white smile .
tr	0	' What can I say ?
tr	0	You haven 't changed at all !
tr	3	' About that . '
tr	1	' In Paris ? '
tr	0	Not that I 've heard of anyway .
tr	0	He might know something . '
tr	1	Christophe Lacroix leaned back in his chair .
tr	4	I might be able to help . '
tr	1	' I 'm afraid that 's impossible .
tr	1	Our clients are very -- particular .
tr	1	' No , ' I murmured thoughtfully .
tr	0	' Fancy a walk ? '
tr	1	I said to Reid after a while .
tr	3	It beats sitting here the whole night .
tr	3	' Is that you , Hubert ? '
tr	1	Reid and I froze on the landing .
tr	4	Inside , the shelves were well stocked .
tr	1	murmured Reid with a frown .
tr	0	I picked up a small rectangular board .
tr	0	It was a postcard from Italy .
tr	0	The transaction was dated four weeks ago .
tr	0	Beyond it was a lab .
tr	2	The door hung loosely from its hinges .
tr	1	' Smart guy , ' murmured Reid .
tr	4	We turned and headed for the car .
tr	4	' Cover me ! '
tr	1	I shouted , indicating the Jag .
tr	1	I ran for the car .
tr	3	It was the memory stick .
tr	1	I glanced at the rear view mirror .
tr	0	There was a distant bang .
tr	2	' Not really . '
tr	2	We were coming up to a roundabout .
tr	3	' Put your seat belt on . '
tr	4	Both have been involved in crashes .
tr	0	Reid scratched his chin thoughtfully .
tr	4	We exited the cafe .
tr	3	' Amongst other things . '
tr	4	Reid gazed at my profile .
tr	1	' This original ? '
tr	4	We need to talk . "
tr	1	said Reid with a frown .
tr	0	It was Prof. AM Godard .
tr	2	I looked at him blankly .
tr	2	He paused and looked around .
tr	0	Beyond it was a laboratory .
tr	0	The woman shook her head firmly .
tr	1	Anna is very conscientious .
tr	1	I said quietly as we strolled past .
tr	4	My fingers closed over the katana .
tr	2	I felt my pulse slow down .
tr	1	My lips parted in a grim smile .
tr	2	' Now go ! '
tr	2	' Do I know you ? '
tr	3	The old man started to say something .
tr	4	There was movement beside me .
tr	3	The old man turned at the sound .
tr	2	' Don 't follow us ! '
tr	4	Then , he was gone .
tr	2	' And you know this how ? '
tr	4	Reid mulled this over for a while .
tr	3	' Look at it this way .
tr	4	' Yes , they are . '
tr	2	An old stock of some sort ? '
tr	3	' That 's strange . '
tr	1	he said , sitting down heavily .
tr	0	' That was from a Turkish sabre .
tr	3	' Better make the most of it .
tr	2	' Do you know this man ? '
tr	0	' He 's a Bastian immortal .
tr	1	A shadow moved across the glass .
tr	4	We waited for ten minutes .
tr	1	' Isn 't this the sewers ? '
tr	2	I pulled on it sharply .
tr	0	It came away in my hands .
tr	2	Reid directed the torch downwards .
tr	4	More locked grilles appeared in our path .
tr	3	' That 's definitely bad . '
tr	4	The door refused to budge .
tr	2	There was no lock on this one .
tr	2	' What 're you doing ? '
tr	4	He stared at me incredulously .
tr	1	' My name is Lucas Soul .
tr	1	' I 'm sorry .
tr	0	I frowned at the unfamiliar name .
tr	1	My head snapped up .
tr	3	They struggled upright and started to run .
tr	2	Black clad bodies fell around me .
tr	2	He fell backwards with a dull thud .
tr	2	' Look out ! '
tr	4	There was a noise behind me .
tr	1	I looked at him steadily .
tr	4	he hissed at the end .
tr	1	Footsteps sounded behind us .
tr	4	' Is everyone all right ? '
tr	1	said Victor with a frown .
tr	2	He turned and studied the shadowy canal .
tr	0	A short and sharp exchange followed .
tr	2	' We 'll deal with Marcus later .
tr	2	' Welcome aboard , boys .
tr	1	Anna 's face rose in my mind .
tr	4	Something else caught my gaze .
tr	1	Another cracked its windshield slightly .
tr	0	The Hummer was back on our tail .
tr	1	' Hang on ! '
tr	3	' Take out their tires ! '
tr	0	' Oh shit ! '
tr	2	It had slowed down .
tr	2	I coughed and blinked .
tr	0	Reid lay heavily against me .
tr	2	' I 'll live . '
tr	0	The Skoda was a fireball .
tr	4	Sirens blared in the distance behind us .
tr	1	I murmured almost to myself .
tr	1	They shouted a warning in German .
tr	4	Someone yelled ' Stop !
tr	1	This is the police ! '
tr	2	We skidded to a stop .
tr	1	My hands unconsciously balled into fists .
tr	4	' We meet again . '
tr	1	I looked at him steadily .
tr	0	' So what are you saying ?
tr	1	I suppressed a sigh .
tr	3	' Not just him .
tr	3	' Is that a threat ? '
tr	1	The Frenchman was frowning again .
tr	1	' You found the trucks ? '
tr	2	Lacroix opened his mouth to reply .
tr	2	' How 're you holding up ? '
tr	1	I sat down on a bench .
tr	1	' You 're right .
tr	2	The red-haired immortal nodded amiably .
tr	1	' Lucas , ' I murmured .
tr	1	Bruno grunted and lapsed into silence .
tr	2	' Hello , Lucas . '
tr	1	' That 's Olsson . '
tr	0	he said sharply , glancing at us .
tr	2	Olsson took a step forward .
tr	2	Olsson smiled and held up a badge .
tr	2	I looked at Lacroix .
tr	1	A low chuckle escaped Olsson 's lips .
tr	0	They 're obviously lying . '
tr	3	It was the wrong tone to take .
tr	0	' What 's the rush ? '
tr	2	Olsson grunted and jerked backwards .
tr	2	Rounds scored the floor behind us .
tr	2	' Armoury door was wide open . '
tr	3	' Stop right there .
tr	0	' He 's right .
tr	1	I returned his smile grimly .
tr	1	' You 're right . '
tr	2	I had to know .
tr	2	The longsword clattered onto the polished floor .
tr	2	He collapsed to the floor .
tr	2	I looked around the station 's reception .
tr	4	Reid and I stepped towards the exit .
tr	1	Lacroix studied me with a frown .
tr	1	Bruno barked the order again in German .
tr	1	' Hang on ! '
tr	4	The passenger window cracked .
tr	4	' Get us out of here ! '
tr	0	A tram had materialised on the road .
tr	1	' Hang on ! '
tr	1	A blare of horns erupted around us .
tr	2	I looked over my shoulder at Anatole .
tr	4	' Where are you going ? '
tr	2	I studied the bodyguard with a frown .
tr	0	' Why would he betray you ? '
tr	2	Bruno looked at me thoughtfully .
tr	2	The bodyguard nodded with an awkward expression .
tr	1	Bruno shifted uncomfortably under my unrelenting stare .
tr	2	He took another gulp from his glass .
tr	1	' No , ' Bruno replied gruffly .
tr	4	Silence fell across the room once more .
tr	2	' Like hell , ' said Anatole .
tr	0	You already had half the gin . '
tr	3	Anatole muttered in a distinctly disgruntled tone .
tr	0	' You guys ready ? '
tr	1	' Yes , ' said Bruno .
tr	2	' Anyone got a smoke ? '
tr	1	Victor stared at me in the mirror .
tr	0	A clearing appeared ahead of us .
tr	3	He took a step towards the van .
tr	4	' Where would they have gone ? '
tr	1	' Not far , ' Victor replied .
tr	1	A muffled curse sounded to our right .
tr	2	' Come on , move ! '
tr	2	Reid grunted and clutched at his arm .
tr	4	' We need to split up ! '
tr	3	I called out to Victor urgently .
tr	2	Shots rang out from somewhere close .
tr	2	The immortals fell with hardly a cry .
tr	4	I studied the landscape with narrowed eyes .
tr	0	The immortal was tall and lean .
tr	1	Reid was going to die .
tr	4	I opened my eyes .
tr	0	' Hi , ' said Anna softly .
tr	1	A faint frown marred her brow .
tr	4	she murmured in a puzzled tone .
tr	1	' Reid is fine .
tr	1	As was I , incredibly enough .
tr	2	A myriad of questions clouded my mind .
tr	0	My gaze switched to Anna .
tr	1	A frown marred her brow again .
tr	2	Footsteps sounded outside the room .
tr	0	He favoured his right leg slightly .
tr	1	This time , I was successful .
tr	0	' Two days , ' Anna replied .
tr	0	It was Tomas Godard .
tr	2	' She 's your doctor .
tr	0	He stared at Anna .
tr	2	' You did ? '
tr	0	The safe house was a manor .
tr	1	Victor shifted awkwardly in his chair .
tr	2	' Who are you ? '
tr	2	Godard suddenly looked incredibly old .
tr	0	Anna 's head snapped up .
tr	0	He glanced at his granddaughter .
tr	1	Anna 's voice rose slightly .
tr	2	The old man looked positively haggard .
tr	0	Reid laid a hand on my arm .
tr	2	Why be coy about it now ? '
tr	0	He glanced at Victor again .
tr	3	I stared at him , still doubtful .
tr	0	' Grandfather , ' Anna whispered .
tr	3	That woman used to bully me . '
tr	1	Victor 's ears glowed brightly .
tr	0	I said at last .
tr	2	A dozen questions clouded my mind .
tr	2	My gaze shifted to Godard .
tr	1	' Yes , ' said Tomas .
tr	1	Anna rose and switched on the lights .
tr	3	' Felix was there that night ? '
tr	4	' Yes , ' I replied .
tr	2	Victor and Godard exchanged troubled glances .
tr	2	Another jolt of shock darted through me .
tr	0	Anatole was more straight-forward .
tr	2	Tomas Godard shook his head regretfully .
tr	1	' Anyone hungry ? '
tr	0	I said , looking at Anna .
tr	4	said Reid , eyebrows raised .
tr	0	' What was it again ? '
tr	1	said Reid with a frown .
tr	1	You 're kidding , right ? '
tr	0	I stared at Anna .
tr	4	' Hubert discovered something else .
tr	3	' That 's the thing .
tr	0	Anna glanced at me .
tr	1	It was Anna 's turn to frown .
tr	3	' What picture ? '
tr	1	' Where did Strauss go ? '
tr	4	She looked at her grandfather .
tr	2	' My goodness , ' murmured Godard .
tr	1	' It was raining .
tr	0	Anna stared at me .
tr	3	' You went to the bank ? '
tr	0	Anna sounded fairly appalled .
tr	3	It was my turn to frown .
tr	2	' Will this help ? '
tr	4	There was a memory stick . '
tr	2	' What 's wrong ? '
tr	4	We changed them all the time .
tr	3	' What 's that ? '
tr	1	said Reid , frowning .
tr	0	Anna glanced at me distractedly .
tr	1	Reid 's words mirrored my own thoughts .
tr	2	' Do you need a hand ? '
tr	1	His worried gaze shifted to Victor .
tr	2	Tomas Godard hesitated before nodding slightly .
tr	3	I pointed it out to Anna .
tr	0	I gazed at Anna blindly .
tr	0	Anna frowned at the diagram .
tr	1	' It isn 't similar . '
tr	3	' What about it ? '
tr	0	Anna stared at me .
tr	2	I felt my blood grow cold .
tr	0	' Yes , ' said Anna .
tr	1	I stared at the crimson liquid inside .
tr	3	' I just have to do this .
tr	2	' How long will this take ? '
tr	0	Anna hesitated and glanced around the table .
tr	0	Anna 's head came up .
tr	4	' Yes , ' she whispered .
tr	0	Anna glanced at me .
tr	0	' What are you saying ? '
tr	0	Tomas Godard went pale at her words .
tr	2	' What now ? '
tr	1	Victor leaned back in his chair .
tr	1	said Victor in a frustrated voice .
tr	0	He stared at Bruno and Anatole .
tr	4	But we need some answers . '
tr	1	' Sorry , boss . '
tr	1	' And this one ? '
tr	4	A faint smile crossed her face .
tr	4	' You 've been busy . '
tr	3	Something tightened in my gut .
tr	3	And the ones after that ?
tr	0	Was that man Tomas Godard ?
tr	0	He glared at Bruno and Anatole .
tr	2	' Does Roman know about this ? '
tr	4	They were only after the woman . '
tr	3	I started down the stairs .
tr	4	His eyes widened further still .
tr	0	Anna looked away with a frown .
tr	4	The prisoner glanced at me and snorted .
tr	2	Look at him ! '
tr	2	Blood seeped onto his shirt .
tr	2	My lips parted in a small smile .
tr	1	' Father , ' Victor murmured back .
tr	2	Reid shifted and stretched his wounded arm .
tr	1	I said with a frown .
tr	2	' Come , join us . '
tr	2	Tomas Godard went rigid .
tr	0	Anna placed a hand on his arm .
tr	1	She was also frowning .
tr	4	There was a low grunt beside me .
tr	1	Reid said in a hard voice .
tr	1	Costas 's gaze shifted past me .
tr	0	' And you are ? '
tr	2	' For now . '
tr	0	I glanced at my grandfather .
tr	4	' Thorne is here ? '
tr	1	His eyebrows rose at Victor 's expression .
tr	0	' You 're lying !
tr	2	' And you forget .
tr	1	' How is that possible ? '
tr	3	The immortals all stared at Victor expectantly .
tr	0	Anna sat back in her seat .
tr	0	Anna gazed at me steadily .
tr	1	The frown still marred her brow .
tr	1	she added in a warning tone .
tr	1	I smiled faintly in response .
tr	4	He looked at his father pointedly .
tr	4	He straightened and looked around the table .
tr	1	His smile turned grim .
tr	4	They worked well together in Vienna . '
tr	0	A grin lit up Anatole 's face .
tr	0	Anna scowled at Victor .
tr	3	' What 's not to like ? '
tr	1	Victor nodded with a satisfied expression .
tr	4	We leave at dusk . '
tr	1	I said in a low voice .
tr	2	Sullen silence followed my words .
tr	1	' Like this ? '
tr	1	Anna murmured , correcting her grip .
tr	2	I shook my head slowly .
tr	2	' Er , good .
tr	1	' Am I interrupting something ? '
tr	2	' Was he now ? '
tr	0	' I had a good teacher . '
tr	2	' Shall we ? '
tr	4	' I never doubted it . '
tr	2	Sundown came too fast .
tr	2	Tomas Godard shook his head .
tr	1	Olsson 's assertion was evidently misguided .
tr	1	' Thank you , ' I murmured .
tr	4	The frown had returned to her face .
tr	2	' How are you doing ? '
tr	4	Reid continued in the same tone .
tr	0	There was a faint click .
tr	2	' Oh , come on ! '
tr	2	Muted voices rose south of our position .
tr	0	I glanced at my watch and frowned .
tr	1	I said in a low voice .
tr	3	' I 'm with the Bastian escort .
tr	0	I appear to have lost my way .
tr	2	He stepped back and admired his handiwork .
tr	2	' Can you work this ? '
tr	2	' What 's wrong ? '
tr	2	It would take too long . '
tr	2	He and Anatole moved towards the door .
tr	3	It was titled " Red Death " .
tr	4	' Is he alone ? '
tr	2	' Will do . '
tr	2	' Good luck . '
tr	1	' How is this possible ?
tr	0	He leapt backwards to avoid the blow .
tr	1	I blocked his first blow .
tr	3	' But I won 't . '
tr	0	' You ready ? '
tr	4	There were no visible exit routes .
tr	0	' What are you waiting for ? '
tr	1	Bullets crisscrossed the air around us .
tr	0	' Are you guys okay ? '
tr	1	' Did you kill him ? '
tr	2	Victor was the one who voiced it .
tr	1	' It was Costas 's idea .
tr	4	' Here 's the first file . '
tr	1	' Like making someone immortal ? '
tr	0	Today was Tuesday , and that meant Bible class .
tr	2	What in the world was he supposed to do now ?
tr	4	The turquoise knit cap she wore slid over one eye .
tr	2	" Sounding so Bolivian , and looking it too .
tr	1	Her own failings couldn 't ruin the moment for the kids .
tr	3	" Of the thunder when it storms . "
tr	1	He 's stronger than anything in this world . "
tr	1	That 's just because Noah is your friend .
tr	2	He was much too goofy for anything else .
tr	0	Noah was always so happy-go-lucky and watched way too many cartoons .
tr	0	That was more than most Afghan children could dream of .
tr	4	Gabriel flashed merry eyes at them and winked .
tr	4	" Let 's get out of here . "
tr	4	In the morning his team would meet here early .
tr	4	By speaker , he meant the next target .
tr	0	" Guys , Alejo knows what he 's talking about . "
tr	1	I don 't know if I can say this .
tr	3	But he didn 't tell them about Ruben .
tr	1	" Just fine , I 'm doing fine . "
tr	4	" I 'm glad you 're feeling better .
tr	4	But then she caught herself and angrily kicked herself into reality .
tr	1	Noah 's face was just inches from hers .
tr	4	Then she broke away and looked Rudolph right in the eye .
tr	0	" Yeah , man , " Tiago rushed on .
tr	1	I am the worst missionary in the world !
tr	1	" So , that was my first kiss . "
tr	0	Oh yeah , and I 'm drunk , she thought angrily .
tr	2	" I 'm not letting you go home by yourself !
tr	0	You , my dear , are totally wasted . "
tr	2	And don 't worry , " he said seriously , kindly .
tr	2	Alejo felt his brow lower saying it out loud .
tr	4	A house number clearly visible over the door .
tr	4	The rest of Alejo 's team had stayed behind in Peshawar .
tr	2	" And as for you , your hour has come .
tr	1	Alejo hid his displeasure behind a passive mask .
tr	3	" Think about it and let me know . "
tr	3	But Gabriel didn 't need to think about it .
tr	0	And now Gabriel was just passing it all on .
tr	3	Gabriel , it 's not about the money !
tr	0	It was all about doing what Allah wanted .
tr	4	You 've got to make me pure and clean .
tr	2	If you look at us , you 'll die ! "
tr	0	Gabriel swallowed hard and took a steadying breath .
tr	4	I have the money right here in my pocket .
tr	2	" We saw you go into the bank .
tr	2	How could you get so lost in your thoughts ?
tr	0	Sweat ran down Gabriel 's face , along with the blood .
tr	3	That was supposed to be comforting , wasn 't it ?
tr	1	But Gabriel felt the smile drain from his lips .
tr	0	a man called from a few rows back .
tr	4	Old accident or not , the bus passengers were curious .
tr	2	" Looks like Islam is growing here , too . "
tr	1	She paused , frowning , wondering what Tobin was doing here .
tr	1	Standing in front of her bench , smiling down at her .
tr	2	" We didn 't know it would freak you out . "
tr	2	She had to think of something normal to say .
tr	0	Now , Noah set his jaw and looked away .
tr	3	His gaze went back to the mist in the distance .
tr	2	" You can take more time off , you know . "
tr	0	" I mean , what a freak accident , right ?
tr	2	He 's got to be careful , you know . "
tr	2	" Yeah , you 're going to love this .
tr	0	Gabriel leaned against a fat banana plant , visually disturbed .
tr	2	" What are you going to do , che ? "
tr	1	I can hike into town and find a new spot .
tr	0	" In Cochabamba the sniper could easily get away .
tr	2	Gabriel let out a low whistle and looked at Alejo .
tr	0	Then , I 'm going to mail a package . "
tr	4	Thank you God for letting me be here .
tr	2	Kayaking yesterday was cool though , too . "
tr	2	he called out in his most booming voice .
tr	2	" So , what have you been doing today ? "
tr	0	" That place run by the hippy lady and her family .
tr	0	Why hadn 't some guy snatched her up ?
tr	3	" That 's where henna tattoos work the best . "
tr	2	Trying to compose himself , he knocked loudly on the door .
tr	2	" I 'm going home , to Cochabamba !
tr	3	It won 't be the same without you . "
tr	3	What if the last bus out tonight left without them ?
tr	3	She stared at the two tickets Noah clutched in his hand .
tr	1	He paused , noticing her lip was quivering .
tr	2	" She 's a lot of fun for one night .
tr	1	" I mean , what is his problem ?
tr	0	When I came back to Cochabamba he was gone .
tr	3	The tone was a statement , not a question .
tr	2	" Now might not be a good time .
tr	1	" I 'm kind of messing this up .
tr	4	" Ok then , " he said nervously .
tr	4	" Everyone in the world is desperate for grace . "
tr	1	" This is what 's unique about Christianity : grace .
tr	2	No other religion has a god who gives grace . "
tr	1	She came to consciousness as if in a dream .
tr	0	Something that had the shape of a human .
tr	2	He glared at all of them , including Gabriel .
tr	0	" Yeah , this is cool , huh ? "
tr	0	" You guys shouldn 't talk that way around a lady .
tr	3	" Oh , cut it out , Stalin ! "
tr	0	Acid scalded Alejo 's stomach and he took a deep breath .
tr	0	But she would have had to go anyway .
tr	2	" I 'm not going to hurt you , ok ?
tr	2	" You 've got to lay down ! "
tr	0	Alejo was surprised to hear a Bolivian name .
tr	1	A gold star ring twinkled in the America girl 's nose .
tr	0	" My grandpa was a missionary , too .
tr	0	" I have a medical kit , " he said hoarsely .
tr	1	His team needed him to kill this girl .
tr	1	For the mission , he had to kill this girl .
tr	4	And he was asking her if she needed Band-Aids .
tr	1	She blinked , noticing he wasn 't wearing a t-shirt anymore .
tr	0	And now she was stuck here with him .
tr	0	" My name is Paulo , " he said .
tr	2	You and Noah had nothing to do with it .
tr	1	You never would have known a thing . "
tr	2	" It 's you you should worry about .
tr	0	Noah was just a nice guy who wanted an earring .
tr	1	Islam is the only light for Latin America .
tr	3	" That 's a little bit freaky . "
tr	2	Paulo was blinking at her , obviously shocked .
tr	2	" Why don 't you find out yourself ? "
tr	0	" Your family has , like , adopted me in Cochabamba .
tr	4	They 've been wondering for years where you 've been ! "
tr	1	" We are not terrorists , ok ? "
tr	2	" You 're going to get cut on the rocks ! "
tr	1	Gabriel turned back towards her with a cool grin .
tr	1	" Don 't even think about disappearing , ok ?
tr	1	" That 's my girlfriend , you idiot ! "
tr	1	" Your ex-girlfriend , isn 't it ? "
tr	2	Well you should thank me then for doing you a favor .
tr	0	Her boyfriend is dead , along with Salazar .
tr	1	Don 't get your knickers all up in a knot .
tr	1	Alejo panted , sweat running down his back .
tr	1	I didn 't know , I promise you .
tr	2	Just for you , I won 't touch her again . "
tr	1	" Yes , I think fun time is over . "
tr	2	I 'm not going to hurt you . "
tr	2	" I 'm so sorry , " he choked .
tr	2	" I told you I wasn 't going to hurt you .
tr	2	Nothing 's going to happen to you now , ok .
tr	2	Two more seconds and he would have cut your throat .
tr	1	" If it 's broken , I can set it .
tr	0	Are you , like , a hit man ? "
tr	1	" No , I 'm not a ' hit man ' !
tr	2	" We don 't just go around killing people .
tr	3	But first there 's something I have to do .
tr	2	" I know they 're going to look for them . "
tr	0	He saw me as family and I betrayed him . "
tr	1	A shiver ran from her toes to her scalp .
tr	0	The man 's ample face instantly spread into a grin .
tr	0	Alejo saw her glaring at him and smiled tightly .
tr	1	" Since I 'm going into Cochabamba anyway on business . "
tr	2	My friend here would like to borrow some of your clothes .
tr	2	" Nope , " Alejo shook his head firmly .
tr	2	She 's got to be online right now . "
tr	2	" Alejo says to go to the Hostel Salta NOW ! "
tr	1	" You know where it is , right ? "
tr	1	For once , her status was listed as Offline .
tr	0	Alejo was staring at what his sister had typed .
tr	1	" I 'm erasing this conversation , " he said .
tr	4	" I 'm going to help Boris ready the plane . "
tr	3	They both headed for the steps of the Hostal Salta .
tr	2	But cheap hostels didn 't ask for copies of your ID .
tr	3	His mother stood there , older but still beautiful .
tr	2	" Anyone following you on your way here ? "
tr	1	" Any strange cars outside your house ? "
tr	4	Your parents were still waiting to see what happens .
tr	4	Everyone from the bus is presumed dead . "
tr	4	Salazar needed to die , whatever the cost .
tr	0	The broken voice of his father sliced through his heart .
tr	0	Alejo turned towards him as if in daze .
tr	2	Alejo paused , trying to come up with words .
tr	4	Everyone else seemed too horrified to even speak .
tr	4	Are they safe sleeping here , with you ?
tr	4	Oh God , " she repeated , her voice breaking .
tr	2	Alejo , don 't you know how much I loved you ?
tr	0	Well , I was happy as a Muslim , Dad .
tr	1	Alejo sat down in the chair , hiding his uneasiness .
tr	0	Alejo groaned and leaned back heavily in his chair .
tr	2	For that , you don 't know how sorry I am .
tr	1	Or working for drug dealers , in prison ? "
tr	4	He immediately regretted his sarcastic words as his father looked away .
tr	1	But they were his brothers and sisters , for goodness sake !
tr	2	" We should call your family , " he said .
tr	0	His mother and sister must think him a psychopath .
tr	4	But it had been so long , an entire lifetime .
tr	4	Besides , I told her I 'd take care of her .
tr	3	I 'm not letting her out of my sight . "
tr	0	He shook his head and then sat up straighter .
tr	2	" Do you really want to know ? "
tr	2	not only a government official for the state of Cochabamba .
tr	2	A medium-sized town on the outskirts of Cochabamba .
tr	0	We always played cars and war and everything you can imagine .
tr	1	My dad had a lot of influence in the community .
tr	0	Biblical submission to your husband and all that . "
tr	3	it was the best I could do ! "
tr	2	" Could you come over to the other room ? "
tr	0	I know why he wanted Salazar dead . "
tr	3	The word still seemed to taste bitter in his mouth .
tr	3	" Won 't they be watching the bank ?
tr	4	" They won 't help them because you 're a terrorist ?
tr	1	" We 'll go to plan B , " he announced .
tr	1	" I won 't leave Bolivia until I know . "
tr	4	He closed his eyes and massaged his temples even harder .
tr	2	I 'm not going to leave you alone . "
tr	2	I 'll just ward off all of those killers myself .
tr	1	I did such a lovely job of it last time .
tr	2	Alejo scooted closer and slung an arm around her shoulder .
tr	4	We 've got these nice , dark tinted windows .
tr	1	Just slit the window so no one 'll see us . "
tr	1	What was he doing in this kind of place ?
tr	0	he had the audacity to ask with a crooked grin .
tr	4	" Of course you can have the bed .
tr	3	That 's why they 're going to be so mad . "
tr	3	" I think we should try to rest . "
tr	0	You said that you have been a Muslim ? "
tr	1	It 's him I want , not a religion . "
tr	0	His brain told him he should say something .
tr	2	A morning in which Alejo would go to a funeral .
tr	1	Tobin was folding her into an embrace against his bony shoulders .
tr	4	" I can 't believe this happened to Noah .
tr	2	Of course she would sing , if it was for Noah .
tr	2	" Yeah , " Eduardo said , and sighed .
tr	3	He gave it to you ... right ? "
tr	4	" Were you one of his friends ? "
tr	1	This picture must be from when he was studying international business .
tr	0	" What was your name , dear ? "
tr	2	Look what comes of all this supposed ' doing good ' !
tr	1	And guess what , no one knew anything !
tr	3	" I 'm going to translate for them .
tr	0	She had already passed away from severe trauma .
tr	1	" No , sir , I can assure you ? "
tr	4	Hector 's voice trailed off and he sighed .
tr	2	Then maybe they could sneak out with no one following .
tr	2	I don 't even know how to talk with you .
tr	2	" Oh , good , thank goodness ! "
tr	0	" Oh , just outside the wall , having a snack .
tr	1	The rest , as they say , is history . "
tr	3	" I 'll go with you and talk to the Khan .
tr	1	Downstairs , something hissed , smooth wood scraping across tile .
tr	1	as he ran across the grass to try to reach her .
tr	0	Gabriel looked at Alejo and shook his head sadly .
tr	2	Do I have to cuff you so you 're not tempted ?
tr	2	I know you could take me out like a fly . "
tr	4	Well this time , I couldn 't let her die . "
tr	3	The right thing was to let her live . "
tr	0	" Yeah , " Gabriel nodded , " With all that ?
tr	3	" Well I thought it was just plain wrong .
tr	4	What 's the big deal if they die ?
tr	2	Alejo was going to lose one of his best friends .
tr	4	Gabriel glanced in the rearview mirror as Benjamin shut the gate .
tr	1	Two silver guns with silencers , glinting in the afternoon sun .
tr	2	Please let me honor you , oh God .
tr	0	She can get out and run away . "
tr	2	Stalin sighed , glumly , and Alejo felt bad for him .
tr	3	" He wants to talk to you . "
tr	2	Of course you know what you 've done ? "
tr	2	" So , you left the gringo couple alone ? "
tr	1	" I 'm coming in a sec , guys .
tr	1	Stalin continued , whispering , sweat trickling down his temple .
tr	2	Alejo doesn 't know how to do that stuff . "
tr	2	God , are they really going to kill him ?
tr	2	" You are all like family to me .
tr	1	I don 't want anything to happen to any of you .
tr	0	The older man 's voice was hurt and angry .
tr	2	" Oh no , oh no , oh no ! "
tr	1	I don 't think I can do this . "
tr	3	We just do what we have to do , Stalin . "
tr	0	She was holding her breath , heart in her throat .
tr	1	She was confused to find that she was crying .
tr	3	She had to tell the guys up front .
tr	0	She scrubbed her hand frantically on her black pants .
tr	1	Gabriel snapped his long fingers , calling her attention back .
tr	2	He suddenly slowed down and his shoulder sagged .
tr	0	She left a palm on Alejo 's back .
tr	1	The bullet 's shock waves could have serious repercussions .
tr	2	I 'm going to be honest with you .
tr	2	An airlift to Chile or Argentina would take too long .
tr	0	The idea brought a new chill of shock .
tr	0	And that she had seen the whole thing ?
tr	3	What am I thinking , how could I forget that !
tr	3	The doctors think he might not live . "
tr	2	" We must pray for this poor boy , too .
tr	4	The only way to relieve the swelling is to operate .
tr	3	" But the impact still caused this swelling .
tr	4	" He told me I wouldn 't remember your name .
tr	4	I can 't believe I 'm here . "
tr	3	It 's to be expected with the brain trauma . "
tr	4	But he really didn 't feel at peace .
tr	4	Not after all the time we 've spent .
tr	0	Thank God , Dr. Ortega said it wasn 't actually broken .
tr	2	" I 'm sorry this happened to you ? "
tr	3	They spent the next three hours watching TV .
tr	3	But the news story wasn 't over yet .
tr	1	His voice was still shaking , and he was obviously elated .
tr	0	And he had a miraculous healing to back it up .
tr	1	She gaped back at him , still not quite believing this .
tr	4	These were the messengers Alejo had been told about ?
tr	2	" There 's someone who would like to talk with you .
tr	1	" I think it 's the braid . "
tr	1	Braids turned around , crouching on the stairs .
tr	3	The two strangers broke pace next to dented white Toyota Corolla .
tr	4	" You two newbies in the back . "
tr	0	" I am really very glad you came . "
tr	0	You have arrived at an ostrich farm . "
tr	0	I work for an organization that can help . "
tr	0	Alejo regarded the older man calmly , face giving nothing away .
tr	2	" How do you know about us ? "
tr	0	" I had a dream about you , Alejo .
tr	0	In my dream I saw her with a star .
tr	0	Alejo was back in his chair , leaning forward , pleading .
tr	2	Alejo was bowed over onto his knees , sobbing .
tr	3	But with these videos , the investigation starts for real .
tr	2	" I 'll take you to your room .
tr	4	We are the best of the best , che .
tr	4	Why would we need some person to take away our sins ?
tr	0	Except man can 't earn God 's favor .
tr	2	" You know I don 't do mornings . "
tr	2	" Don 't let my pale face fool you .
tr	4	" Where did you grow up then ? "
tr	1	For now , it is this organization . "
tr	1	Like I said , I want to help you .
tr	4	Alejo 's temple throbbed and he felt himself grimacing .
tr	1	He could do this , work with Rupert in CI .
tr	0	What you 're saying is all I want to do .
tr	1	" I know , " Rupert said simply .
tr	2	What would you say if we prayed , right now ? "
tr	0	" Take a half-hour , " he said , eyes sparkling .
tr	2	It 's going to be good , son . "
tr	2	Do you think I would drive you batty ? "
tr	1	He felt his mouth tip into a lopsided smile .
tr	3	He paused , trying to think of something rational to say .
tr	0	I want you to take Noah 's place . "
tr	0	" Uh , that is a very bad idea .
tr	2	Alejo had to really work to compose himself enough to speak .
tr	4	Alejo 's mouth opened , then snapped shut .
tr	3	" I think you 're already a little attracted to her .
tr	3	Just a little penance , a little making things right .
tr	1	For that , I 'm giving you some time .
tr	2	Unfortunately , Peter was not a good name for women .
tr	2	" You know , Greek for ' rock ' . "
tr	4	I 'm here because He forgave my huge debt .
tr	1	The words formed very slowly in her brain .
tr	0	" It 's all taken care of . "
tr	3	She struggled to know what else to say to him .
tr	4	" So , we 'll meet in three months , then .
tr	2	Now Alejo 's mouth flickered into a full-blown smile .
tr	4	Usually he was done feeding the huge birds by about five .
tr	2	The hairs on Alejo 's arm stood on end .
tr	2	Oh my goodness , it 's been so long ! "
tr	0	" Alejo , I was a loser and a coward .
tr	2	It was so good to hear from a friend .
tr	3	You did the right thing in the moment .
tr	0	Alejo clicked the sound off and read : " At mass .
tr	2	" God Wants You to be Rich ! "
tr	4	Or the theological arguments for why Jesus was divine . "
tr	0	Sami swallowed and his Adam 's apple grazed the abrasive stone .
tr	0	We could have gone away to Germany or Canada together .
tr	3	It had been three months , and it still hurt .
tr	4	So unexpected sounds made her a little nervous .
tr	1	And in Bolivia I said I 'd find you .
tr	4	He eyed her with something she could almost call appreciation .
tr	2	" You did really well , though . "
tr	3	Her first thought was : It 's a bullet .
tr	0	Isaac 's and my plan for the climb was simple .
tr	2	He was now at a point called the Notch Couloir .
tr	4	Just then , the world went white before me .
tr	4	The rush of beating the tempest had his adrenaline pumping .
tr	4	I could see he was scared , yet invigorated .
tr	3	It was indeed my turn to run the gauntlet .
tr	1	My survival instincts kicked in and I dug deep .
tr	4	" Perfect , " I remember saying to myself .
tr	0	As quickly as the avalanche came , it went .
tr	4	Isaac yelled to me over the roar of the avalanche .
tr	3	That 's where it gets a little sketchy .
tr	2	Only the mother of all rock faces in Colorado .
tr	3	He stared at it for what felt like an eternity .
tr	1	" No way , man ... it aint happening .
tr	0	That whole face is covered in snow , " Isaac said .
tr	1	Using my hands alone just wasn 't going to work .
tr	2	My stomach churned as I looked down through the falling snow .
tr	1	Is this how I 'm going to die ? "
tr	3	Forty feet , thirty feet , Isaac moved with determination .
tr	0	Just then , Isaac was caught in an avalanche .
tr	1	As the wave slowed , so did Isaacs descent .
tr	0	Nope , a crazy man would have let go .
tr	1	Lena stopped running and sat down next to Trae .
tr	2	How could you even miss ' im ? "
tr	4	" Lena , come here , " Trae said .
tr	3	" Trae , what 's the matter ? "
tr	3	Any retaliation by rebel forces would start with them .
tr	2	As fate and misfortune collided , so did shell and flesh .
tr	1	Instantly , he dropped to the ground in agony .
tr	1	In his delirium , his world seemed to slow .
tr	2	He rolled on his belly and began to crawl .
tr	1	This was his first pass through as he searched for casualties .
tr	2	Doc Morgan will have that leg off in no time .
tr	0	It was all he could do , and it was enough .
tr	0	It started as a low clicking sound , barely audible .
tr	1	He spun on his heels and ran toward the operating wagon .
tr	4	There were three soldiers lying with their feet toward him .
tr	3	Looking up at his assistant , then up to Corp. .
tr	1	This really should be quite simple with him unconscious . "
tr	4	He then began to aggressively saw through the bone .
tr	1	BP is eighty over fifty-five , pulse ox is eighty-five . "
tr	4	" Should we get an ultrasound in here ? "
tr	1	" My god , she 's just a baby .
tr	1	" Clear , " Dr. Warner called out .
tr	1	He finished the incision and called , " Clamp . "
tr	1	" Suction , " Dr. Warner called out .
tr	1	" Doctors , BP is dropping again , sixty-five over forty-eight .
tr	0	" It appears that way , why ? "
tr	3	" Dammit , you know what that is ?
tr	1	That 's another entry wound , " Dr. Warner replied .
tr	0	" Eight blade and sternal saw , STAT ! "
tr	1	" Rib spreader , " Dr. Warner requested .
tr	4	Anticipating his request , Nurse Edwards handed him the instrument immediately .
tr	1	" Probe , " Dr. Warner requested from Nurse Edwards .
tr	1	I need more suction , " Dr. Warner asked with frustration .
tr	0	He pulled his hands from her chest and stood back .
tr	2	" Call it , " he mumbled quietly .
tr	3	Standing in front of the elevator , he pushed the button .
tr	4	He appeared somewhat accidental to the photo 's purpose .
tr	2	David gazed upon the doctors in the photo .
tr	2	This is one strange dream , " David said out loud .
tr	1	" Whoa , I 'm seeing color in this dream .
tr	3	David turned and took a step onto the grass .
tr	1	A confused expression crossed his face as he spoke .
tr	1	" That is quite an unusual uniform you have on .
tr	0	" Uh huh , and where did you come from ?
tr	4	" Young man , are you a deserter ? "
tr	1	I am not in the military , " David responded .
tr	3	" Doctor , the truth is I need a job .
tr	2	" Well , doctor , do you have a name ? "
tr	0	May I ask what your name is ? "
tr	4	He tied the last bandage and lifted his head .
tr	4	Slowly , he extended his hand in greeting .
tr	0	" I 'm pleased to make your acquaintance , David .
tr	1	David replied , trying to contain his confidence .
tr	1	This was as primitive as he could imagine .
tr	1	" Dr. Warner , what is your assessment ? "
tr	4	He continued , " Do we have the chloroform ready ? "
tr	2	Dr. Morgan asked , now intrigued by David 's plan .
tr	1	Satisfied with his cleansing , he slowly washed away the soap .
tr	2	With the patient out , Dr. Morgan looked on closely .
tr	4	The damage was much more extensive , but manageable .
tr	2	All he could do now was to wait .
tr	2	These samplings are brought to you by Big Pine Lodge Books .
tr	1	I don 't think it 's memory loss or anything magical .
tr	1	But back to the building I found myself in .
tr	4	There were a lot of kids , mostly older than me .
tr	1	Then I went looking for the giant washing machines again .
tr	1	Then I ducked into an open machine to change .
tr	2	Most were in clothes too baggy or too tight .
tr	3	I had to crawl out the last three feet .
tr	2	Just follow me for now , " she said .
tr	4	I must be experiencing some kind of memory blackout .
tr	4	I wondered what we were going to be late for .
tr	1	Miss Jackson hissed , thrusting her paper and pencil at me .
tr	4	She turned on her recording device and started capturing the dialogue .
tr	1	" What do you think will happen if it fits ? "
tr	1	" This is going to take a while .
tr	4	Jessica passed her the key and held her breath .
tr	1	Jessica gasped , " Look out , Missy ! "
tr	4	There were lots of lakes , state forests , and campgrounds .
tr	2	I really can 't tell you much more .
tr	4	He said he especially wanted to give you something . "
tr	4	We might need boots and warmer jackets . "
tr	1	It was a dark brown log building three stories high .
tr	2	" Can I get you some coffee or hot chocolate ?
tr	1	" I never knew this , " Kim Stark said .
tr	2	I 'll get Kevin to show you around . "
tr	0	It was quite loud and echoed across the lake and back .
tr	3	At least that 's what Mr. Stark told me .
tr	2	Come on , I 'll show you . "
tr	2	Missy walked over to the windows and looked out .
tr	2	" Come on , I 'll show you more . "
tr	2	Behind the door on the left was a bathroom .
tr	2	Missy walked to the window and looked out .
tr	1	It was a two-room suite , much larger and brighter .
tr	2	Again Missy went to the window and looked out .
tr	3	" See that trail past the last cabin ?
tr	3	He reached for the knob but it wouldn 't turn .
tr	2	" So open it , you 've got a key . "
tr	2	" How do you know if you don 't try ? "
tr	2	She wiggled it back and forth and pushed on the door .
tr	1	She said , " But I 'm family .
tr	2	He lifted a poster of Snoopy and revealed a narrow door .
tr	1	" Yeah , this is pretty scary , " she confessed .
tr	0	" Okay , you go back and take the stairs .
tr	2	A small amount of light was coming in through some vents .
tr	1	" This is cool , " she said .
tr	0	It was your father 's when he was a boy . "
tr	0	Your dad and I made that together a long time ago .
tr	2	Pretty good for an old man , huh ? "
tr	3	Did Kevin tell you to say that ? "
tr	1	He was still laughing but Missy was embarrassed .
tr	3	Actually that wasn 't so far from the truth .
tr	2	" Are you coming , too , Mom ? "
tr	4	" Weekends and one week in August . "
tr	4	The scenery was certainly different from that snowy day in March .
tr	1	Missy 's mom asked " Hi , Kevin .
tr	1	Kevin slowed down and answered Mrs. Stark first .
tr	1	He 's in the dining room now . "
tr	3	It was in the servants ' wing on the first floor .
tr	3	He pointed to a paper on the nightstand .
tr	1	" She 's probably going over receipts with your great-grandfather .
tr	3	Kevin pointed to the bark at the bottom of the tree .
tr	1	" Oh , you startled me , " Missy said .
tr	1	Missy was pleased that he was asking for her opinion .
tr	4	He was maybe a high school boy , fifteen , sixteen .
tr	0	His hair was longish and he didn 't look pleasant .
tr	4	They were just guessing that I 'd be here .
tr	4	They 'll do whatever Dave tells them to do . "
tr	3	They got out of earshot as fast as they could .
tr	1	Lonnie and Ricky pushed past them and ran for the canoes .
tr	3	They laughed as they watched it fill with water and sink .
tr	4	" I bet I know where the younger brothers are going .
tr	2	Come on , let 's go follow them . "
tr	0	He had dark hair and eyes and a dark personality .
tr	2	Somebody 'll come along sooner or later . "
tr	3	" They didn 't know about the flashlights .
tr	2	" Ooo , we 're gon na get lost .
tr	1	Lonnie and Ricky must have taken a different tunnel .
tr	2	They 're probably out and in our canoe by now . "
tr	1	Missy 's heart started its hummingbird flapping again .
tr	2	" Is that you breathing so hard , moron ? "
tr	4	Kevin hurried to the drapery that hung over the exit .
tr	3	The drapery that hid it didn 't reach the ground .
tr	0	Rob held the candle up high then down low .
tr	1	" Think of something else , " Ricky said .
tr	2	" Okay , let 's go check out our room .
tr	0	They dashed through the lobby and cut through the dining room .
tr	0	He had come up behind them without a sound .
tr	3	A little punishment 's not a bad thing .
tr	3	" No , but it can 't be hard .
tr	0	" Okay , but what about Rob and Dave ?
tr	2	" I thought we agreed on our story . "
tr	0	Their claws were sharp and their digging was fast and methodical .
tr	2	The flock rose as one and noisily flew off .
tr	2	Your dad 'll probably ask you tonight . "
tr	2	They could hear footsteps on the plank floor .
tr	3	Missy watched the rope tighten up and lift off the ground .
tr	4	The one he wouldn 't let us ride in ? "
tr	1	Ricky and Lonnie may still be down in the caves . "
tr	2	Rob turned and looked back at the open trapdoor .
tr	1	" You thinkin ' what I 'm thinkin ' ? "
tr	1	" I think he saw us , " Missy said .
tr	0	" Wait , why are you going that way ?
tr	3	" We can catch that tank , that 's why .
tr	2	" Maybe somebody 's poaching out of season .
tr	2	Shooting a nice buck or doe , " Lonnie surmised .
tr	4	" There really must be another way out after all . "
tr	3	" I want to know how they did it .
tr	1	" I 'm not riding no pony , " Lonnie said .
tr	1	" He 's not a pony , " Missy said .
tr	1	He burst out laughing and so did Missy .
tr	2	He got up and walked over to Johnny .
tr	1	Missy went through the opening first followed by Lonnie on Johnny .
tr	4	" Hey , loosen up on the reins .
tr	1	There was no room to turn the horses around right here .
tr	3	Her only option was to start to trot .
tr	1	The first horse passed beneath them snorting and tossing his head .
tr	3	They jumped off the trail just in time .
tr	4	They should be banned from the lodge . "
tr	1	I 'm Lonnie and this is Ricky . "
tr	2	Missy pulled his head up and straightened around in the saddle .
tr	1	" Wait , " Lonnie said , trailing behind her .
tr	2	" Tell us how you got out of the caves .
tr	1	" But how did you guys get out ? "
tr	0	Rob glanced at Dave and raised an eyebrow .
tr	2	" I suppose your brother is riding , too ? "
tr	2	He couldn 't figure out how to do it .
tr	0	Missy slowed to a trot and finally a walk .
tr	2	Looks like you 'll be riding all day long . "
tr	3	" What 's the matter , dear ? "
tr	0	" Oh , nothing , well , yeah .
tr	2	Mrs. Jackson scowled , raising one eyebrow for a question mark .
tr	2	Mrs. Jackson shook her head and thought for a moment .
tr	4	Dave and Rob never got into the water .
tr	1	Missy assured them that the rumor was false .
tr	3	It was so unexpected to get a gift .
tr	2	Kevin looked around for Missy who hadn 't shown up yet .
tr	1	It wasn 't like her to miss a bonfire .
tr	2	" Just doing stuff in my room . "
tr	3	" Nah , they 'd make us put it out .
tr	0	As soon as they straightened up the loud farts began again .
tr	0	she said and picked up her chair to move away .
tr	2	He stuffed it under his armpit and folded his arms .
tr	1	" Yeah , I like your thinking . "
tr	4	They checked inside and made a pit stop in the bathroom .
tr	4	He moved left just as he heard Ricky flush .
tr	2	Let 's change into all black clothing . "
tr	1	Especially with some snorts and some leaves rustling . "
tr	2	Tommy fell on his butt , mouth open in shock .
tr	1	Tommy slapped his hands to the sides of his head .
tr	4	He searched the air again until he located the spot .
tr	1	He planned to spend the money on candy .
tr	4	A wall of hot air greeted him as he entered .
tr	0	There was a small doll carriage , too .
tr	3	This had to stop and it had to stop right now .
tr	3	The little girl grabbed at it and pushed it back down .
tr	2	It looked like a rock but it felt like a pillow .
tr	0	Maybe this was all a dream , he thought .
tr	0	He looked all around and everything was clear as day .
tr	0	Then he laughed at himself for thinking such a silly thought .
tr	4	He straightened up again and the dizziness was gone .
tr	4	Tommy peered around the blue branches and watched .
tr	2	He began bouncing his way along from rock to rock .
tr	3	Tommy awoke with a start from the hard ground .
tr	1	I 'll give you a whole dinner for that pink coin .
tr	1	A whole dinner and two blue coins in change . "
tr	0	This wasn 't a bad deal after all .
tr	0	The center was meaty and juicy and a bit salty .
tr	2	Don 't you know to knock before you enter ?
tr	0	How could such a thing happen so quickly ?
tr	2	He quickly scrambled forward and down the backside .
tr	0	An owl flew straight at him and nipped his ear .
tr	4	He felt his forehead where the first one smacked him .
tr	2	He rose up and took the torch from the closest wall .
tr	4	Eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve .
tr	2	So much fire now and smoke , too .
tr	2	Tommy stood at torch number eighteen and looked .
tr	2	Blow out one torch and they 'll all go out . "
tr	0	Tommy did and found himself in a lavish palace chamber .
tr	1	And even I can 't send you back .
tr	0	He had to at least ask for a name .
tr	1	" Hi , like I said , I 'm Tommy .
tr	0	The prince frowned at such a small and simply wrapped gift .
tr	0	That really annoys teachers , " Tommy added .
tr	4	The Prince chewed slowly on the gum and eyed Tommy suspiciously .
tr	1	" This is fascinating , " the Prince proclaimed .
tr	0	" Can I save it for later ? "
tr	2	The prince shook his curls and got up from the ottoman .
tr	0	Tommy had no idea what he was talking about .
tr	0	A very tall door was closed and barred .
tr	4	The Prince was already three feet up and continuing .
tr	0	At the top both boys swung a leg over and balanced .
tr	0	This book is available in paperback and digital e-book format .
tr	1	I guess it 's ' cause I 'm tall .
tr	2	But cool won 't help you against Bigfoot .
tr	2	Okay , I know you don 't believe we saw Bigfoot .
tr	1	Austin and I just stared and covered our mouths and noses .
tr	3	" What do ya think that stuff is ? "
tr	4	He kept staring at the enormous dung pile .
tr	0	He claimed he was making sure it wasn 't bat poop .
tr	1	For once I didn 't have anything to say .
tr	0	I think each toe was as big as her hand .
tr	0	Callie was calling from the back of the pack .
tr	1	I can 't run in these sandals . "
tr	2	Now I know that Callie gets good grades .
tr	3	Austin warned me , but it was too late .
tr	4	Chapter 4 - Sounds So there we were .
tr	3	" It 's only a little bit after one .
tr	4	We haven 't been out here that long . "
tr	3	I knew that they had heard it , too .
tr	3	We started to laugh and we couldn 't seem to stop .
tr	1	My sides started aching and Austin was clutching his stomach .
tr	0	Her dad can actually tell a joke without using any English .
tr	3	Making little noises that would attract a predator .
tr	0	Predator was a spelling word we had last month .
tr	3	Cool that I get to use it in a sentence .
tr	1	" I think we should go , " Austin said .
tr	0	" Natalie , do you know the way back ? "
tr	4	Especially now , right now , because the hunger has me .
tr	4	There are others in the motel with different auras .
tr	0	My name is Maya , and his name was Ryan .
tr	1	It was finding friends with strange passions and loud laughs .
tr	0	Somehow my constant metaphors and little dramatics only spark amused forbearance .
tr	3	The realization that it 's okay to dream .
tr	1	His face is familiar , but I can 't place it .
tr	1	* * * Ryan and I sit down for lunch .
tr	1	" High standards , " I chime in .
tr	2	The man , he looked , I don 't know . "
tr	1	" Dangerous , " he says , nodding with satisfaction .
tr	1	There are two things I do for inspiration .
tr	1	This is the second thing I do for inspiration .
tr	1	They are doctors , teachers , janitors and construction workers .
tr	3	He stutters something about the stars , and I look up .
tr	3	Ryan laughs at this thought when I say it out loud .
tr	0	Some part of him cracks hard against the pavement .
tr	1	He opens his arms , and I don 't understand .
tr	2	A low gurgled moan comes out of my throat .
tr	0	It is the boy with the baseball cap and curly hair .
tr	1	I hear his voice echoing in the distance .
tr	0	I wrap my arms around my body and weep .
tr	2	For the first time , I look around .
tr	2	Now , lay down on the cot . "
tr	4	This is strange , because Ryan never plays jokes on me .
tr	0	I am going to take away all your weaknesses . "
tr	1	This is the first emotion he 's allowed across his face .
tr	2	For now though , bone marrow will suffice .
tr	3	Your body will try to fight the change . "
tr	1	He turns his head , and a smile touches his lips .
tr	1	" I 'm making you my daughter . "
tr	1	I find it strange that I conjure such a line .
tr	3	It 's so hard to think at all right now .
tr	2	Two explosions so loud that I cover my ears .
tr	0	A ball cap on his head with wavy hair spilling out .
tr	4	" We 're too late , " another voice says .
tr	2	" ... need you to concentrate ... how many shots ? "
tr	3	That 's good ... ... work with that .
tr	4	" We have to go , " the other voice says .
tr	2	Each of my vigilante custodians has their own method of evasion .
tr	0	So , it was a dark and stormy night .
tr	2	Somewhere far off a coyote howled to the moon .
tr	3	... Oh , now that 's just mean .
tr	3	" Is that the best you 've got ? "
tr	0	Maybe I wanted to be up against the wall .
tr	2	Ranger T hollow points , got ta ' love ' em .
tr	1	For you see , this wasn 't just any girl .
tr	1	" Damn it , I will save you ! "
tr	2	The shot took off most of his left hand .
tr	1	This will soothe the pain inside of me .
tr	0	The strap of my bra has fallen to my elbow .
tr	0	" Yeah , it 's a warm night .
tr	1	The skin of my palms is puckering , splitting open .
tr	3	I 'm still burning to death , by the way .
tr	3	The seatbelt digs into my hips , and I cry out .
tr	3	I hit the ground and curl my legs into my chest .
tr	2	There 's a lot of blood on him .
tr	1	So blue with sudden streaks of lavender lashing across .
tr	2	" We 'll buy her rabbits , " he says finally .
tr	1	I lift myself up to my elbows with difficulty .
tr	4	The legs in front of me step a little wider .
tr	0	" No , " the elf says again .
tr	2	" No , " Gabe looks at me over his shoulder .
tr	2	" Wouldn 't do much good anyway . "
tr	0	If I concentrate , I can catch their words .
tr	0	I think he might have other things on his mind .
tr	4	The melody of hunger is filling up my head .
tr	3	I hear a TV chattering in the next room .
tr	0	Upstairs , a woman cries beneath the spray of a shower .
tr	1	Gabe is talking , offering a cup of liquid .
tr	2	" It 'll help , " he says .
tr	1	I ask in a thin little girl voice .
tr	1	Something in his face seems so sad and so real .
tr	0	Lying against a headboard with his hands cuffed behind his back ?
tr	3	" ... well , it 's the truth .
tr	3	Their eyes say something to each other that I cannot fathom .
tr	1	My wrists are sore from straining against the handcuffs .
tr	1	" I imagine it must be very painful .
tr	0	The hunger , " a voice says from far away .
tr	1	The dog 's tail wags from side to side .
tr	0	" All I found was a pet shop .
tr	2	" Stop being ... so god damn adorable . "
tr	1	She 's been straining against the cuffs . "
tr	1	" She 's hungry , " Gabe says .
tr	4	A blade slides between my skin and the cuffs .
tr	1	The plastic snaps off , and I think I understand .
tr	2	I let the limp body fall out of my arms .
tr	0	I look up and see a boy in a ball cap .
tr	4	What if the stress gives her another ulcer ?
tr	0	" Wait for it , " Gabe says .
tr	0	I could reach over , snatch away that vibrant blue .
tr	3	" It 's a lot to take in .
tr	3	We don 't have to talk about it now . "
tr	1	I wait a while for this to set in .
tr	0	" Why ... " I take a breath .
tr	0	I am pushing my palms flat against the concrete roof .
tr	1	" By mixing up monsters in his lab ? "
tr	1	He wanted to turn men into angels . "
tr	3	" You 're taking this a little too well . "
tr	4	Revenge would surely be beneath you , but not me .
tr	1	" To save us from ourselves , " Gabe shrugs .
tr	2	A lonely little smile plays across his lips .
tr	0	" No one can actually be that naïve . "
tr	2	I have absolutely no idea how to respond to this .
tr	0	Luckily , I get distracted by my body going crazy .
tr	1	Sunlight crawls up my knees and flows across my hands .
tr	0	He holds his hand out into the light .
tr	2	Cook got close , but not close enough .
tr	0	" He was a very wealthy and very brutal man .
tr	3	They still don 't know who did it .
tr	2	I shouldn 't even be telling you all this .
tr	1	Gabe stands up and thrusts back his shoulders .
tr	1	Even changed my own diaper this morning . "
tr	2	You 're too blind to recognize what she is .
tr	2	Dear little sis could have latched onto you and killed you .
tr	1	" I didn 't hurt him , " I say .
tr	3	" We need to think about this . "
tr	2	My mind is little jagged puzzle pieces all falling apart .
tr	1	This is the moment I decide that I will run away .
tr	2	Home is Farewell , Colorado , just outside of Pueblo .
tr	2	He looks up , clicks off his window .
tr	3	" I want to hear the rest , " I say .
tr	1	He sighs , closes the lid of his computer .
tr	2	There 's some sort of conflict going on in his mind .
tr	1	So did their sight and sense of smell .
tr	2	Could memorize whole books in an afternoon . "
tr	4	They needed more , and the hunger was overwhelming .
tr	0	Gabe lays his head back against the headrest .
tr	0	" You hope , " I say quietly .
tr	0	" This shouldn 't have happened , " he says .
tr	1	" You sure you feel up to driving ? "
tr	1	" If you need anything , just ask . "
tr	1	" I 'm right here , " I say to him .
tr	1	Quite a kick in the balls , right ? "
tr	4	Long fingers of red reach all the way through his energy .
tr	0	Thane always had a way of getting what he wanted .
tr	2	Cook had no one else to turn to . "
tr	1	It is a promise he gave his life for .
tr	1	A promise my brother and I carry forward . "
tr	0	" That 's what we do , " Gabe says .
tr	0	It 's a sad smile , heavy with purpose and pain .
tr	1	" Well , it kind of is . "
tr	4	I keep telling her that Ryan is in trouble .
tr	0	They get all sad and angry at the same time .
tr	1	I realize that I 'll never find him .
tr	4	I wander the beach looking for a bucket .
tr	2	" You 're going to find a cure .
tr	3	And the next and the next after that .
tr	0	My voice could carry through these thin walls .
tr	3	That means I have to get away from them first .
tr	2	Maybe I won 't go to the police .
tr	3	That whole total prick thing is just his defense mechanism .
tr	2	" Oh , and I got us some grub . "
tr	3	God , we 've got to kill that bastard . "
tr	0	" And he 's my father , " I say .
tr	1	" I 'm draining live fish for food .
tr	2	It took him two years to get close enough .
tr	3	It was a terrible fight , but our father won . "
tr	0	" Our parents were smart but also naïve in many ways .
tr	0	" Grand had no idea what she was capable of .
tr	3	The first story I ever wrote was about them .
tr	1	" Until now , " I say to him .
tr	4	I watch the movement of his energy slow and even out .
tr	1	It is entirely different from the thing I once resided within .
tr	1	I wonder what I can do with it .
tr	0	I can tell who is awake and who is not .
tr	3	Not with their auras glowing so blatantly bright .
tr	1	I won 't give up , can 't give up .
tr	4	Maybe everything they 've told me is a lie .
tr	0	I can 't really go back , I know that .
tr	3	Doctors can 't stitch up these new tears in my hands .
tr	1	He is gasping for breath , trying to hide it .
tr	2	" You won 't shoot me , " I say .
tr	4	" But she isn 't here either is she ? "
tr	0	I stand up and take a wobbly step away .
tr	2	" Oh god , don 't ... go yet .
tr	1	If you turn , it 'll be impossible .
tr	3	She knew that , and we know that . "
tr	1	This is insane , " my voice squeaks .
tr	2	The words fall from my lips like haunted things .
tr	1	" You 're our sister , " he says .
tr	1	He squares his shoulders and stretches out his hand .
tr	2	Take my hand without your gloves on . "
tr	0	" Come on , " he says again .
tr	2	We 're the only ones who can protect you from Grand .
tr	4	Things I can 't even begin to describe .
tr	1	" No more cuffs , " Gabe says .
tr	4	We 're the only family we 've got left .
tr	0	I can still hear the highway close by .
tr	4	My entire body is tight and sore and aflame with hunger .
tr	4	We all close our eyes and pretend to sleep .
tr	0	The hair swings back just beneath my chin .
tr	1	Then Sarah got pregnant and stopped hanging out .
tr	4	He 's looking for water under the bridge .
tr	1	She will find a way to destroy him .
tr	3	It 's only fair that I return the favor .
tr	2	I put down Gabe 's PSP and look out the window .
tr	0	" Farewell to civilization , " Gabe says with a laugh .
tr	1	The air carries scents of pine sap and loose soil .
tr	2	Broke a company record actually , but who 's counting . "
tr	3	" Did you know that he drowns baby kittens ? "
tr	1	" It 's his only passion in life . "
tr	4	" I 'm incredibly handsome and clever . "
tr	1	His energy is fluttering like humming bird wings .
tr	0	" Okay , " Francesca turns toward the house .
tr	4	He likes to be in the sun . "
tr	2	" Me too , " I say for no reason .
tr	1	He gives me a warning glare through the rearview mirror .
tr	1	Then a good mow and putting in seeds .
tr	0	" You 're doing a great job , " Gabe says .
tr	4	I 'll give him a call when we get settled .
tr	1	My first impression is that the house seems empty and plain .
tr	3	" What do you think , basement next ? "
tr	0	I shift , but Gabe is already reaching forward .
tr	3	That 's important for girls , right ? "
tr	0	The dark-haired boy is looking down at his sandals .
tr	1	I ignore them and pick up a wedding photo .
tr	4	My mother 's hair is feathered and long .
tr	2	I hold out the beach photo to the boys .
tr	1	" She died , " he says softly .
tr	2	It 's kind of a rule for any closed doors . "
tr	0	" Wait , " I call as he turns to leave .
tr	0	" Yeah , " Gabe leans forward against the doorway .
tr	4	Your scent is there , on the edge of the bed .
tr	3	They 're the only things without dust on them . "
tr	4	I notice Gabe 's flushing cheeks and realize my mistake .
tr	0	He looks away , and I see his real face again .
tr	1	" It 's okay , " I say brilliantly .
tr	1	" If you need anything , just knock .
tr	3	The night feels too long , and I 'm not tired .
tr	2	The property around the house devolves into thick woods .
tr	3	It 's time to know what I can do .
tr	1	My body is moving , leaving my thoughts behind .
tr	0	What happened to the shy boy in the photographs ?
tr	1	" I caught a squirrel , " I tell him .
tr	2	" No , not us , " Gabe follows my gaze .
tr	2	" And you look for dead people ? "
tr	2	Radiation is a strong component of the process .
tr	1	" Bingo , Yahtzee and Connect Four . "
tr	1	Angels kill by absorbing a victim 's energy .
tr	0	Autopsy will show a way low body temp at death . "
tr	3	" It 's the only way not to get caught .
tr	3	" You stay , but get in a workout . "
tr	1	So do his eyes , and that scar .
tr	2	Do I know any good Chuck Norris jokes ?
tr	2	" Fox Cave , " Gabe nods to the door .
tr	0	" And maybe Francesca happens to take the same class .
tr	0	A new and dark awareness is awake inside of me .
tr	1	Gabe rolls over and wipes his face on his shirt .
tr	2	" How do you get the guns ? "
tr	0	Gabe lies against the ball and crunches up .
tr	0	He speaks with the rhythm of his motion .
tr	0	Gabe laughs and sits up on the ball .
tr	3	Whatever you want , you can get it .
tr	3	" It 's not easy , but it 's doable .
tr	1	" Bingo , Yahtzee , and Connect Four .
tr	1	I drop down , brush my hands on my jeans .
tr	0	" Thanks , " I turn away from him .
tr	0	I can 't blame him , I really can 't .
tr	2	" We have a responsibility for you now . "
tr	3	It might be better for us both if he doesn 't .
tr	1	The expression on my face stops his rush of words .
tr	4	I need Ryan to be alive somewhere in the world .
tr	1	Breathing and laughing and chewing on his lip .
tr	1	I drop the limp body and keep running .
tr	1	Running away from the self-loathing and pity that compete for dominance .
tr	3	I don 't understand at first what I am seeing .
tr	1	There is no beginning or end to the wounds .
tr	1	Thin cuts and thicker furrows where the skin has grown over .
tr	1	Our eyes lock through the mirror , until his slide away .
tr	4	The back door opens , and Gabe eases down beside me .
tr	1	" Few suspicious deaths , probably nothing , " he answers .
tr	3	" We , uh , we don 't talk about it .
tr	2	" I would have liked to go to prom though .
tr	2	Our mother was the only one who could ever control her .
tr	4	His fingers tap the sides of the bottle between his hands .
tr	1	" This is so stupid , " he mutters .
tr	1	His scars rip open , pulse blood through his tattered clothes .
tr	1	Blood smears the window as he presses his hand against it .
tr	1	" I didn 't know if Grand was following him .
tr	1	I was afraid he 'd kill himself . "
tr	1	Gabe lays his forehead against the post and closes his eyes .
tr	1	Gabe opens his eyes , stares out across the lawn .
tr	2	He doesn 't do any of that anymore .
tr	0	How much brighter it glows than anything else out here .
tr	0	It has a real spine and thick vanilla paper .
tr	1	I didn 't ask him to buy it .
tr	0	I had meant to say " hello . "
tr	4	The gun held steady , aimed at my head .
tr	3	The trees trap the heat and turn it swampy around us .
tr	2	" Yeah , I 'm about to drop .
tr	1	" It 's fine , " he says .
tr	2	" You don 't know the way back . "
tr	0	No trace of any vial holding a magic , glowing cure .
tr	2	What did our mother 's voice sound like ?
tr	2	How far would you go to kill Grand ?
tr	3	Tried to talk us out of it , actually .
tr	1	I bought a dress though , just in case .
tr	3	Well , if my parents didn 't clean it out . "
tr	2	Afterwards , I would wonder about you sometimes . "
tr	3	" I know that sounds lame , but it helped . "
tr	2	" Well , then not angelic at all .
tr	2	" It 's not your choice anymore Gabe .
tr	0	Make sure it 's what you really want . "
tr	2	" Gabe , she could lose control at any moment .
tr	3	Plus , I hate that little fucker . "
tr	1	" She 's trying real hard , " he says .
tr	4	" Guns aren 't people , " Gabe says .
tr	1	" I 'm wearing these huge , stupid sunglasses . "
tr	1	I cry , and slump down into my seat .
tr	4	" Suppose he doesn 't drive the whole day .
tr	0	" Yeah , why the hell not ? "
tr	2	We 'll probably only be gone an hour or so .
tr	0	He stares are me , waiting for an affirmation .
tr	4	" Here , " Gabe offers his PSP .
tr	0	What can I say to Amy so that she will understand ?
tr	3	What is there to understand about this at all ?
tr	1	Gabe is standing below us screaming , " Shit ! "
tr	2	He goes into the bathroom , shuts the door .
tr	4	Gabe sets the duffle bags onto the bed .
tr	2	You know , get off on it . "
tr	4	" Yeah , of course , " Gabe replies .
tr	0	* * * Las Vegas has a hangover in the morning .
tr	3	The city is washed out , dry and nasty hot .
tr	1	The lights blink and jive with futility against a brazen sun .
tr	1	Shut up , shut up , shut up !
tr	4	" But Maya wants to see Cirque du Soleil .
tr	1	" I don 't really ... " I begin .
tr	1	" Your humility is heartwarming , " Gabe cuts in .
tr	4	The bundle in the trunk shifts whenever the car turns .
tr	2	Little iron lions rear up on each post .
tr	2	Oh , you boys look good enough to eat ! "
tr	1	" This is Buffy , " Gabe nods to me .
tr	1	" Thanks , I simply adore it . "
tr	1	His eyes find mine and alight with interest .
tr	3	" That 's what Big Brothers is for . "
tr	3	" If you boys need anything , just go get it .
tr	4	We 're going to be in the lab .
tr	2	" Oh , how lovely of you . "
tr	1	He emotes a bad ass vibe with middling success .
tr	2	" How old you want me to be ? "
tr	4	Those women should just kill themselves already . "
tr	0	" How did you manage a CT Scan ? "
tr	3	" You know , this must be really traumatizing .
tr	2	If you need a shoulder to cry on .
tr	1	Raw , bright colors edge into his aura .
tr	2	" We 've got work to do . "
tr	2	I am poked and prodded , X-rayed and scanned .
tr	1	I 'm mentally clinging to him like a frightened cat .
tr	1	Fire licking up the insides of my bones ... .
tr	2	" If you drug me I might lose control .
tr	2	" I can control it , " I tell Lo .
tr	0	The energy around him jumps once , high off his body .
tr	1	She probably can 't digest solids anymore . "
tr	4	We 've been keeping her intake as low as possible . "
tr	1	" She 's no hybrid ; she 's an angel . "
tr	4	It 's possible that her energy needs are equally stunted . "
tr	0	Hate him , hate him , hate him .
tr	0	I ask casually as I pull out the iPod ear buds .
tr	2	I force them back and look at Lo .
tr	1	" How did you get into the sidekick business ? "
tr	1	Now I recognize the man in the painting .
tr	0	He was in the papers about two years ago .
tr	4	" My father got himself infected , turned into an angel .
tr	1	Lo smiles , but it 's a mean expression .
tr	2	I 'm in one of those moods again .
tr	1	Part 3 Chapter 31 " Oh Troy , mi amor ! "
tr	2	I 'm in a terrible mood , an angel mood .
tr	4	My resentment is gooey and heavy and black like tar .
tr	0	" We should also put together a bag for Maya . "
tr	0	" Of course I need a bag and a gun .
tr	3	" You don 't want this life . "
tr	1	Gabe 's voice is suddenly low , raspy .
tr	2	" Did she feed at all today ? "
tr	2	He locks all the doors as I reach to stumble out .
tr	2	" You don 't know , " I whisper .
tr	1	I get my bliss , short and sharp as it is .
tr	0	Gabe 's laugh has only a touch of strain .
tr	2	The population would fragment into angels and food . "
tr	4	" So far the angels have kept themselves hidden .
tr	2	I put the window all the way down .
tr	1	" It 's up to you , " I shrug .
tr	0	I fall back against the seat and smile .
tr	0	" Pants on fire , " Gabe calls out .
tr	0	" What , and wash all the luck out ? "
tr	0	" How else is she going to get through this ?
tr	1	Gabe shrugs and puts his laptop on the desk .
tr	4	The envy inside of me is sudden and sharp .
tr	0	All I got was a damn guinea pig .
tr	4	" It 's possible we 've got a newbie here .
tr	2	Lots of people running alone , hiking away from others .
tr	2	You got Microsoft and Nintendo just around the corner .
tr	2	All those mosquito nets for African orphans were just a cover .
tr	0	" I call park , " Gabe says .
tr	4	" Yeah , because you never call it .
tr	1	Gabe looks up from his map and shrugs .
tr	4	He seems to have a lot of different smiles .
tr	0	A ruddy flame sparks and dies in Gabe 's aura .
tr	0	We stop , and Gabe consults his map again .
tr	3	Not very useful with you standing next to me . "
tr	1	" Sometimes I forget how weird this all is . "
tr	3	I ditch the hat and climb up a thick tree .
tr	2	I 'm not sure what I 'm looking for .
tr	1	The swatch is too small to guess at its origins .
tr	0	Why would the angel come this far away from its quarry ?
tr	0	Lake Sammamish to my right , dark and placid .
tr	0	His aura flares up , all spiky , dark and violent .
tr	3	" Just ... don 't do that again .
tr	2	" How 'd it go Dr. McDreamy ? "
tr	0	" You want me to wear pajamas on a stakeout ? "
tr	2	I huff to the bathroom and slam the door .
tr	3	That 's the best thing about being bait .
tr	0	Gabe leans back in his chair and looks me over .
tr	2	I drop the limp body on the floor .
tr	1	The ones that might be lions in disguise .
tr	0	Why you came back after all those years . "
tr	3	" I just want you to know that . "
tr	0	It was only a matter of time , Maya .
tr	1	" His family takes blood very seriously . "
tr	2	" Mom did a good job of hiding you .
tr	1	That 's when me and my genius brain got involved . "
tr	1	And then I don 't hear him anymore .
tr	4	These daggers in my lungs feel so real .
tr	1	" Your high school newspaper archives all of its issues online .
tr	0	The girl in the middle had a birthmark on her shoulder .
tr	1	The air is so hard to pull in .
tr	3	Gabe stands up , but I beat him to the door .
tr	0	He wears a snug black jacket and black pants .
tr	1	Gabe is still in his torn jeans and wrinkled shirt .
tr	3	" We 've got to get them out of the park .
tr	4	" We can 't , " he decides .
tr	4	" We won 't be able to find them all . "
tr	1	I rest my chin on my gloved hands and fume .
tr	1	I hook my arm in his and swing him around roughly .
tr	3	This is what brings me down enough to start thinking .
tr	3	" Running after that angel , that was stupid .
tr	1	I 'll do it in the morning . "
tr	2	Kind of a lot to live up to . "
tr	1	" I 'm calling it a night . "
tr	3	I can 't even tell the rabbits apart .
tr	1	" K , thanks , " Gabe sighs .
tr	0	Chapter 39 I am awake and on my feet instantly .
tr	0	he chokes and reaches out to touch his brother .
tr	4	" The angel killed a preacher last night .
tr	2	We go on mind blowing dates all over the world .
tr	2	" Oh my god , you 're such a nerd ! "
tr	1	" But we need to finish the mission first .
tr	0	Man : This is Bob ... Woman : And Kathy McGee .
tr	3	I 'm great with dogs , by the way .
tr	1	" This is stupid , " I tell Gabe .
tr	1	He stands up , stretches his arms up over his head .
tr	4	" No , we 're going to find something here . "
tr	0	Just hard work and some really awesome hacking .
tr	1	It 's tedious , mind numbing , incredibly frustrating .
tr	0	" ... like , glowy , like ahhhh . "
tr	1	His teases express themselves as little greenish whirls in his aura .
tr	1	I grab my phone with a dripping hand .
tr	1	" Yes , yes it is , " I say .
tr	2	I hope they all found good homes . "
tr	2	" Oh no , no , you 're not in trouble .
tr	1	I give him my Wild West Squint O ' Death .
tr	1	" I am a friggin ' genius ! "
tr	0	" That was me , " I add .
tr	2	" Do you always have to do this ? "
tr	0	" That 's legal , " I say .
tr	3	That 's where I got a hit on the list . "
tr	3	That 's kind of sad , " I retort .
tr	3	You have to take the safety off first . "
tr	1	My voice is shrill enough to check his steps .
tr	4	" You 've been doing this your way forever .
tr	2	" Because you 're so fucking good at that ! "
tr	2	" I 'm not asking for a good life .
tr	2	" You 're doing this for my own good .
tr	3	" Gabe , I want to learn how to fight .
tr	1	All I can think of is ... . "
tr	1	Again , he takes his time in answering .
tr	2	I 'm in no mood for soft landings .
tr	2	" Did you know you can house train rabbits ? "
tr	0	" Great , I 'm in a favor granting mood . "
tr	1	Not with his sad smiles and mischief eyes .
tr	0	Gabe looks down at the rabbit and smiles .
tr	2	I humbly apologize for my previous attempts to kill you .
tr	1	The song is always here , and it always comes first .
tr	1	I try to be all serious and professional while doing this .
tr	2	I 'll probably bumble in and get us all killed .
tr	1	He lets go of my wrists and I sit up .
tr	2	A young woman stands in the back of the room .
tr	2	Heroes who are too sarcastic for their own good .
tr	4	I 've faced my share of threats before . "
tr	3	They want to throw back diet pills instead of running .
tr	2	How could any of this possibly be real ?
tr	3	" Now , or I 'll start cutting .
tr	1	This is me , still lingering behind the two boys .
tr	4	I heard the noise right before you stormed the office .
tr	1	" Oh , you sick fuck , " Gabe says .
tr	1	" Amber knew to run if anything happened .
tr	4	Wipe down everything when you 're done . "
tr	2	I follow him to the door and stop .
tr	2	I hear the soft sucking of boots pulling away from mud .
tr	1	" This is you trying to be my friend . "
tr	3	" Not that hard , " the girl says softly .
tr	2	" Are you going to kill me ? "
tr	3	" You 're not actually supposed to say that .
tr	2	You 're supposed to say ' no , of course not .
tr	0	" And Grandpa says I 'm special now .
tr	2	" I know what you 're going through . "
tr	0	" I don 't have an aura . "
tr	4	There 's still some human left in you . "
tr	2	I 've memorized most of my history textbook .
tr	1	" Amber , I think I can help you . "
tr	3	" At first I could only move little things .
tr	2	Her face is too stoic for a child .
tr	3	" I 'm not evil , at least not yet .
tr	1	Before I can stand , her fingers wrap around my throat .
tr	0	She hisses with pain and tightens her hold .
tr	4	On the ground , somehow , kneeling against the tree .
tr	2	My thoughts are coming back , stitched crooked but good enough .
tr	2	You 're going back to the motel . "
tr	0	Tears slip down my face as we head back .
tr	2	" Yes , I told Grand about you .
tr	1	" It 's possible , " he says .
tr	4	It would have been nearly inaudible to my old ears .
tr	2	Puddles broken and clouded by my muddy feet .
tr	4	He baited my brothers with their own concern .
tr	3	Faulty heroes , but I won 't tell them .
tr	3	Grand is still out there in the world .
tr	2	I listen to their car doors open and close .
tr	4	" She doesn 't have a choice . "
tr	1	He pauses , probably fishing for his key card .
tr	1	" Alright , " Gabe says softly , surprised like me .
tr	2	The world will still be a violent and ugly place .
tr	2	" It 's not your job to save the world .
tr	4	We are silent a long while after this .
tr	0	Gabe shifts to his back , stares at the ceiling again .
tr	1	Thinking of what Amber said about being evil .
tr	0	That thing is happening when I lose all my thoughts .
tr	4	It will be quick ; he won 't even wake up .
tr	0	My hand reaches toward him , glowing bright .
tr	1	" I 'm trusting you with my life right now . "
tr	3	The words don 't come , but they will .
tr	4	I take a deep breath , all wet and wonderful .
tr	3	Didn 't I just pass the most crucial test of all ?
tr	1	" I 'm in control , " I whisper , awed .
tr	4	Please come by and say hello if you have time .
tr	1	His adorableness is his primary strength as a writer .
tr	2	Individual houses crop up every couple of miles or so .
tr	4	I feel hemmed in by these large trunks .
tr	0	" Yeah , well , I got ta go again .
tr	4	Gabe is already climbing up a tree behind me .
tr	4	" There 's something wrong with their energy .
tr	2	" Who wants to join us for brunch ? "
tr	0	Weak as the wavering flames of a dying candle .
tr	0	" You 're late , " Nathaniel says .
tr	3	" What kind of watch is that ? "
tr	1	" It 's a phone , " I tell him .
tr	4	" Everyone is so excited about those damn phones .
tr	4	Nathaniel 's piercing blue eyes give me the once over .
tr	4	His bushy black eyebrows crunch together in disappointment .
tr	3	" Though , perhaps it doesn 't matter .
tr	4	" These pants are just fine , " I huff .
tr	1	" I think ... I think I 'll just go . "
tr	1	First , Nathaniel is one hell of a misogynist and racist .
tr	3	Secondly , I think I just got the job .
tr	2	" I thought you would never get out of bed .
tr	2	We are not going to leave until hours from now .
tr	4	the questions started to come from all over the assembly .
tr	1	Shiner will issue the passports to his officer .
tr	2	Don 't make me look like a fool .
tr	0	Later that night Cody Hunt held his sides from laughing .
tr	2	He slapped Taylor on the back , almost knocking him over .
tr	0	Air traffic was very light on most days .
tr	3	" What the ... , " Cody started without a thought .
tr	4	Can I store this somewhere around here until we get back ?
tr	1	" Mind if I have a cup ? "
tr	4	We 'll start loading the plane in a minute here . "
tr	1	Taylor laughed and turned around to shut off the fuel pump .
tr	1	" Put on the headphones and switch on the noise canceling .
tr	3	The stars slowly dimmed out of sight for the day .
tr	4	In the end of course the decision was all about money .
tr	2	Seconds later one of his senior agents stormed into the room .
tr	2	He did not allow himself to get contemplative for too long .
tr	0	" I assume you already initiated damage control actions . "
tr	1	It is no secret to us who stands behind this . "
tr	3	Stone was dumbstruck by this casually uttered revelation .
tr	4	We need a more proactive plan to resolve this mess .
tr	2	And so the dominoes had begun to fall .
tr	4	No one ever made it that far back these days .
tr	2	" How 's everyone doing so far ? "
tr	3	Taylor looked at Hunt with a little chuckle .
tr	1	Disturbing the peace was furthest from his desires for this trip .
tr	2	The sound of cabin doors opening cut the tender moment short .
tr	2	" What are we going to do for water supply ? "
tr	0	Let 's gear up and happy trails ! "
tr	1	For him it all was invigorating and intoxicating .
tr	2	Hunt made good on his promise to find water .
tr	2	" Make room for the chuck wagon ! "
tr	2	" First I 'll cook , then we 'll eat . "
tr	0	He looked at Hunt who just shrugged his shoulders .
tr	3	I didn 't know what to think . "
tr	0	They also removed all markings , insignia and serial numbers .
tr	3	Chapter 4 : What Is The Most Important Thing ?
tr	3	" What is the most important thing ? "
tr	4	She replied , " What 's your name ? "
tr	0	She was not happy about that at all .
tr	0	Lilly Ann was having a ball at Taylor 's expense .
tr	2	" Yes , " Lilly Ann was not too forthcoming yet .
tr	0	Lilly Ann had tears in her eyes and gasped for air .
tr	0	All of a sudden she had an idea .
tr	4	She surely must be a very special child .
tr	0	In any case it was quite a wondrous thing to hear .
tr	0	What do you think , should we help them out ? "
tr	3	The girl looked intently at the four strangers .
tr	2	Surely Lilly Ann was playing games with them .
tr	2	How did that work out for you ? "
tr	2	We still have much work to do . "
tr	2	" So , what can I do to help ? "
tr	0	Are you sure you have thought this through ? "
tr	2	I have to ask you for something though . "
tr	2	All I must ask you is not to reveal our location .
tr	3	Put up a tent or something , will ya ? "
tr	0	" I am aware of that , I am aware .
tr	4	" Yes , sir , " Tim Farmer acknowledged instantly .
tr	4	A few hundred yards further they came up on an intersection .
tr	2	I am kind of worried about the answers though . "
tr	2	They did not have to search for long .
tr	2	I hope Lilly Ann is going to be back soon .
tr	0	He ran after Taylor as quickly as he could .
tr	0	It seemed that no one was in any particular hurry .
tr	2	People were obviously familiar with Lilly Ann 's van .
tr	0	May be we can have a chat later on .
tr	2	Good to have you here , folks . "
tr	3	Without asking he put drinks in front of each of them .
tr	0	Seconds later another foaming mug magically appeared in front of Hunt .
tr	3	He was starting to like this place a lot .
tr	2	He grabbed the old man 's hand and shook it vigorously .
tr	2	" Just kidding , did you enjoy the breakfast ?
tr	2	So , what do you want to do today ? "
tr	3	Farmer blurted out jumping off the rock he was sitting on .
tr	0	Might take a while , though , " she laughed .
tr	0	Pull the van around the barn , dear . "
tr	2	It was going to be a long day of hard work .
tr	0	She thought that this spoke very highly of his work ethics .
tr	0	Bye , bye my trusty old VW . '
tr	0	He didn 't know if he should laugh or cry .
tr	1	I can 't drive around like this . "
tr	3	Hunt , Farmer and Spade took the news without much emotion .
tr	3	Let 's just leave it at that for now . "
tr	0	Taylor was glad to be on his way .
tr	0	Spade asked afraid of the answer that she knew already .
tr	1	I can 't believe it , lightning for crying out loud !
tr	2	Do you think Mr. Taylor is ok ? "
tr	3	They were brothers , not by birth but in spirit .
tr	3	They spent most of their days cutting down trees .
tr	2	Why would someone be flying into the storm ?
tr	2	The black cloud grew bigger and so did the bird .
tr	3	It was almost night when they reached the outskirts of town .
tr	3	she started to shout half a street block away .
tr	4	She did not know if he knew that he was different .
tr	0	It 's a dilemma that can tear a man apart . "
tr	3	They probably think John didn 't make it .
tr	3	Don 't want to get in between this one . "
tr	4	Still laughing he retreated out of the house .
tr	0	" A few days , " Lilly Ann answered vaguely .
tr	3	That 'll get us some of your strength back . "
tr	2	" You are a strange cookie , John Taylor .
tr	2	Taylor didn 't quite know how to respond .
tr	4	All three of them felt the mood change in the room .
tr	0	" Who are Jack and Joe Jack ? "
tr	0	This thought he could live with , funny how that works .
tr	1	Still laughing and repeating , " I 'm so sorry . "
tr	2	" Yes , how 'd you know ? "
tr	2	What do we do with it now ? "
tr	2	Thank you , John Taylor , " she added lovingly .
tr	2	" Oh , Lilly Ann didn 't tell you ? "
tr	3	I can 't wait to read it . "
tr	3	I hardly thought about it myself in all that time .
tr	4	This one is from my personal secret recipe . "
tr	2	" How do you come up with this ? "
tr	0	What a great pleasure and honor to see and read this .
tr	0	Thank you so much for sharing it with me . "
tr	1	That was definitely him asking , right John ?
tr	1	" Can anyone explain to me what 's going on ? "
tr	0	" Are you talking about the biblical Abraham ? "
tr	0	" And what was the right answer ? "
tr	2	Can we move on to something more fun now ? "
tr	0	Do you have an idea what that could mean ? "
tr	0	Edie May was curious about Taylor 's understanding so far .
tr	2	How do I get my thoughts to mold energy ?
tr	0	" What do you mean by ' equivalent vibration ' ? "
tr	3	They both had to laugh at that image .
tr	2	They are inspiration , joy and most of all love .
tr	4	They are what we are in our innermost core .
tr	1	" So , about those sixty-eight seconds ? "
tr	3	Taylor wasn 't too amused at that suggestion .
tr	4	From then on you were just their chauffeur . "
tr	4	Taylor did not like where this was headed .
tr	0	If you try you probably land in the bushes .
tr	3	It was an interesting observation to say the least .
tr	2	Do you follow so far , John ? "
tr	3	That feels better , at least now you can breath .
tr	2	Remember , all of this is work done in your thoughts .
tr	2	He looks so happy , don 't you think ? "
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked at both of them for confirmation .
tr	0	" What do you want to play , dear ? "
tr	2	I 'll be still here with my legs not working . "
tr	0	So many wanted to have a turn in the game .
tr	3	He couldn 't get the words out fast enough .
tr	4	I can feel my feet , " he yelled again .
tr	2	Come back to bed now and close the window . "
tr	3	Then I 'll try to make it to the kitchen . "
tr	3	Maybe you understand it better than I do .
tr	2	Taylor took a closer look of the fabric .
tr	4	Taylor 's right knee came up like a reflex .
tr	2	Lilly Ann turned to Taylor , " See ? "
tr	2	I am sure Lilly Ann would love to drive you .
tr	2	You think you are strong enough for that ? "
tr	3	It 's mostly about the questions though . "
tr	4	Her arm made a big sweeping gesture around her .
tr	2	Taylor got curious about the scientifically looking device on the desk .
tr	4	" It 's a computer , " he exclaimed .
tr	3	The ultimate student had found his ultimate teacher .
tr	3	" That is a good start , John .
tr	4	After a short pause for effect they continued .
tr	2	They looked around the room searching for any sign of comprehension .
tr	1	How is he supposed to learn other basic things ? "
tr	3	Lilly Ann thought about it for a moment .
tr	4	She learned a lot about herself in these days .
tr	4	He can predict the weather just by looking at the waves .
tr	1	I think he is doing extraordinary well . "
tr	1	It was as magnificent and inviting as he had imagined it .
tr	1	She looked at John waiting for a sign of understanding .
tr	0	She bit off another hearty chunk to gather her thoughts .
tr	1	" Yep , " was Lilly Ann 's short answer .
tr	2	" Told you , " Lilly Ann beamed .
tr	3	She was certain that this could not be healthy for anybody .
tr	0	" What was the girl 's name ? "
tr	1	and then find any Lilly and ask her .
tr	2	So you choose that , no harm done .
tr	3	They won 't hold it against you . "
tr	0	For anything complicated or far reaching we just ask Lilly . "
tr	3	became the standard greeting that Taylor was welcomed with around town .
tr	4	His girlfriend giggled and slapped him over the head .
tr	3	What 's the story that people are telling ? "
tr	3	She quickly lost her trepidation to talk candidly .
tr	1	I for one find it hard to even imagine .
tr	1	" Sure , anything , " Michael said without hesitation .
tr	3	He didn 't want anything to do with either one .
tr	2	Lilly Ann was royally amused by his strong willed outburst .
tr	1	" I have no intention to found a church . "
tr	2	" I know , " was Lilly Ann 's lazy reply .
tr	0	" I knew you would say that , " Taylor laughed .
tr	1	End of one story , beginning of the next one . "
tr	3	" Isn 't that the end of personal accountability ? "
tr	2	" What is your question for Lilly really ? "
tr	0	Taylor had a hard time not laughing out loud .
tr	4	Her big dark green eyes were calmly fixed on Taylor .
tr	3	Taylor 's heart was about to jump into his throat .
tr	0	" Wan na play ' Chinchilla ' ? "
tr	0	she asked pulling him towards the back yard .
tr	2	" Aren 't you going to ask ? "
tr	1	Now I 'm never gon na tell you . "
tr	3	she just couldn 't let him off the hook that easily .
tr	2	" Sure , " Lilly Ann replied quickly without further explanation .
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked him up and down and curled her lips .
tr	4	Meet me in the kitchen in an hour . "
tr	2	The irony was not completely lost on him .
tr	3	' This might work out after all , ' he thought .
tr	3	He fought a bit to get the cufflinks working correctly .
tr	1	Taylor almost did not recognize himself in the unfamiliar wardrobe .
tr	3	Everything about this suit accentuated his most favorable features .
tr	1	" Are you ready for your party ? "
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked around her , confused only for a moment .
tr	2	She nodded and took him by the hand .
tr	2	Yes , right , last night , Lilly Ann .
tr	2	As she turned around his chin almost dropped to the floor .
tr	2	Another double clap and the lights would go out .
tr	3	Taylor had some difficulty not to get impatient .
tr	1	" Nobody had an explanation for this strange phenomenon .
tr	0	He clapped his hands , and the lights came on .
tr	2	" So , how 'd it go ? "
tr	3	" You want us to meditate with you ? "
tr	1	Lilly Ann inquired , " We can do that . "
tr	4	" Longer than anyone can remember , " Tom replied casually .
tr	1	" And it 's been running on what ? "
tr	0	" Wan na give it a try ? "
tr	3	Tom opened the electrical box that housed the starter button .
tr	2	she asked Taylor looking out through an opened window .
tr	1	" Yes , " she said simply and closed the window .
tr	1	" Jimi , what 's going on ? "
tr	1	It was a short , wild ride to Turner Farm .
tr	2	A quick look under the hood confirmed Taylor 's worst fears .
tr	1	Lilly Ann danced around him fighting imaginary dragons .
tr	2	He took Taylor 's hand and shook it vigorously .
tr	0	" So , what did really happen ? "
tr	1	Winter had been fun , exciting and exhausting .
tr	2	" I don 't know really , " Taylor answered truthfully .
tr	0	The aroma and richness of taste is amazing .
tr	0	" May I ask you a personal question ? "
tr	0	He got up from his chair and hugged Taylor .
tr	2	Taylor looked at him with a quizzical look .
tr	2	I want to marry you because I love you .
tr	2	Taylor looked at him with a sour smile .
tr	1	Fritz folded Taylor 's hand over the ring .
tr	2	He looked at Taylor with a quizzical look .
tr	0	Shows how much I know , right ? "
tr	0	" What are your plans a week from Saturday ? "
tr	4	Was life really supposed to feel that good ?
tr	2	" Are you all right , love ? "
tr	0	Lilly Ann stuck her head through the doorframe .
tr	0	What did I see downstairs anyway , what was that ? "
tr	1	There was just a hint of panic in his voice .
tr	3	The place was buzzing with activity and excitement .
tr	4	As far as Taylor could see there were no women present .
tr	2	Willie could only laugh and shook his head .
tr	0	Willie jumped from his seat and ran towards the man .
tr	2	Why don 't you join us for a drink ?
tr	1	Willie has outdone himself organizing this party . "
tr	2	' Something more to look forward too , ' he thought .
tr	2	He wrapped his arms around Lilly Ann and pulled her closer .
tr	1	Everything fell into place , no rush and no second thoughts .
tr	2	Today I choose to put my heart into your hands .
tr	2	" He is going to do what ? "
tr	4	She is so funny , cracks me up every time . "
tr	3	They all said their goodbyes without drama or hesitation .
tr	2	Who knows who will need it next . "
tr	3	When did he tell you about that ? "
tr	0	The old man had kept his word after all .
tr	0	He had a hard time even formulating an actual question .
tr	3	I wanted to get that out of the way .
tr	1	Taylor 's answer was as much a question as a suggestion .
tr	2	Something to look forward to in another plane of existence . "
tr	1	" What was the first thing you seriously asked ? "
tr	2	" It was actually one of Michael 's long lasting riddles .
tr	3	Gravity is thought , very old static not ever changing thought .
tr	3	" That sounds wild , " Taylor muttered .
tr	0	" I 'm afraid to ask , " Taylor laughed .
tr	1	" You are kidding me , right ? "
tr	2	" How deep does the complexity of your thoughts go ?
tr	2	Joy through expansion and expansion through joy . "
tr	0	, as many as your mind can imagine . "
tr	2	Thank you so much for this , John Taylor .
tr	4	As you see , the power always lies in the question .
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked at Taylor in amused bewilderment .
tr	1	Every child in town knew his name now .
tr	2	You know , I want to fly too . "
tr	3	Hm , didn 't even think about that until now .
tr	2	Would you want to join us for lunch first ?
tr	0	" This is why I brought you here . "
tr	2	Do you think that would be enough ? "
tr	3	I want to get a ride too . "
tr	0	Taylor and Lilly Ann finally made an appearance .
tr	2	What kind of wood is it made of ? "
tr	1	They are very dry and hard as rock .
tr	1	The engine said plop plop plop and was silent again .
tr	4	Taylor nodded again and Wilbur went to repeat the procedure .
tr	3	It sputtered and protested against the inappropriate fuel mixture .
tr	1	Lilly Ann was hopping up and down clapping her hands .
tr	0	Taylor smiled at Wilbur who hadn 't moved or said anything .
tr	0	The careful calculations of weight and balance had paid off .
tr	2	Are you having second thoughts about your choice ? "
tr	2	He pulled Lilly Ann closer to feel her warmth .
tr	3	Law of Attraction brings us whatever we direct our attention to .
tr	3	No preaching to the flock in hope that something sticks . "
tr	4	" You are wearing new underwear , I like it . "
tr	0	There was an obvious question mark attached to his answer .
tr	2	There is a little Lilly growing under your hand . "
tr	2	She obviously had not lost her quirky sense of humor .
tr	1	A child , his child , their child , their Lilly .
tr	2	" What do I know about being a mommy ? "
tr	2	" What do I know about being a mommy ? "
tr	1	" Leila , " Lilly Ann said without hesitation .
tr	3	But that 's not going to do it today . "
tr	0	" So what was the problem again ? "
tr	1	" Yeah , sure , I love playing with kids .
tr	1	" Bringing in the ships , are we ? "
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked at Taylor in utter amazement for his logic .
tr	2	" What do you know about money ? "
tr	2	What brings you the most joy , John Taylor ? "
tr	3	" I hear you want to fly to Texas ? "
tr	0	Edie May said casually as he was getting up to leave .
tr	2	What are you going to tell me tomorrow ? "
tr	4	There was no use in delaying the inevitable .
tr	4	Definitely not before you know my name . "
tr	3	' But what about the deck hook ? '
tr	1	' Language Edward - not in front of Andrew ' .
tr	1	' Yes it was exhilarating ' I said .
tr	1	' I think I might just go up again later ' .
tr	4	( 1 ) Possible leaders , for us to deliberate over .
tr	2	It was going to be a long night .
tr	1	The first one in was Swiss , ex Swiss Air Force .
tr	3	I 'm sure that was really important - I think not .
tr	3	' Isn 't that a specialist trade in itself ' ?
tr	3	She shut down the tiny aircraft and trotted over to me .
tr	3	A slight exaggeration , but they got the point .
tr	1	' Great idea , I like it ' .
tr	0	As you can image it was not a literal translation .
tr	1	' In your dreams sunshine ' I finished with .
tr	4	That was when my mobile phone entered stage left .
tr	3	The dot started to circle and she stopped humming .
tr	2	' Hello my darling , is that you ? '
tr	2	The dot moved up and down , ' yes ' .
tr	1	' I 'm fine my darling , is Charlie listening in ?
tr	2	The dot moved from side to side , ' no ' .
tr	2	Why didn 't he just take ten million dollars for himself ?
tr	0	He didn 't think that she liked them very much .
tr	3	That shut him up , but not Harley .
tr	3	You have the right to an attorney present during questioning .
tr	1	Charlie recited ; his favourite TV program was CSI Miami .
tr	2	' How do you think we got away so easily ?
tr	1	This was definitely a ' just in case ' case .
tr	0	Blackmail noted and accepted I sat back and waited .
tr	2	' Why are you out of a job ? '
tr	1	I said , and plonked an envelope in her hand .
tr	4	I hope she doesn 't get them mixed up .
tr	2	I wondered , and why did Teddy want a flying office ?
tr	4	She had to disgorge the ground crew before we arrived .
tr	1	It was obviously time for slapped wrists all around .
tr	1	' Just you wait and see sunshine ' .
tr	3	' That 's right Sally , what do they do ? '
tr	0	' It 's a special game Graham . '
tr	0	' Natasha has your aircraft got a make-up mirror ? '
tr	3	' The good news is that it isn 't cancer ' .
tr	1	I was beginning to like the whole family .
tr	0	Sasha looked at me and blushed -- and Margaret kicked him .
tr	3	It was certainly turning out to been one of those days .
tr	3	' Sh * t ' grunted Topsy and stormed off .
tr	1	2 - Think of a name beginning with ' T ' .
tr	2	Suddenly he had ' clout ' and lots of it .
tr	1	Within an hour the injunction had been served .
tr	0	Why hadn 't Sandra asked me that question ?
tr	1	He was a qualified miniature railway engine driver .
tr	1	' Yes David , what is it ? '
tr	3	' Right then , what pictures do you like ? '
tr	3	' That 's not too bad ' I said .
tr	0	Ordered compliance , and again my head shook .
tr	4	she spluttered , between giggles , ' it 's horrendous ' .
tr	2	' No , on the back of my toilet door ' .
tr	0	Perhaps Paco and Alba weren 't that bad after all .
tr	1	-- but I did like the colour pink .
tr	2	Were they going to poop on my parade , or not ?
tr	1	This book is the second in my Andrew Michaels trilogy .
tr	0	An attack was promptly launched by Arab nations on Israel .
tr	4	The creek ran through the forest to Alexander Springs State Park .
tr	2	The only transportation was by foot , bicycle or canoe .
tr	2	She nodded weakly and said , " Yes . "
tr	0	I fixed breakfast ; we sat in the cabin and ate .
tr	0	The interior although in disarray wasn 't in bad shape .
tr	0	Anything of a sexual nature is strictly your call .
tr	1	" Surreal what 's your twenty over ? "
tr	1	We rooted through the drawers for a watch .
tr	1	Still I wish we could send out for a pizza . "
tr	2	" Ask your doctor if X is right for you . "
tr	4	I gently pulled Connie closer and drifted off .
tr	3	Get your ass in this boat right now ! "
tr	0	Sam climbed on board and grabbed me in a bear hug .
tr	1	No , it was just a knee-jerk kinda thing .
tr	0	Sam said , " Yeah , that yours ? "
tr	1	Thousands were engaged in tilling fields and planting crops by hand .
tr	1	American cities lay abandoned filled with the remains of their inhabitants .
tr	2	I shouted , " Ahoy Hammer permission to come alongside . "
tr	2	Tell you what ; I 'm willing to meet you halfway .
tr	2	I asked , " How come Astor ? "
tr	1	What a crock of shit we were living in .
tr	1	I said , " Skipper drop that , right now . "
tr	0	He asked , " Is that a sailboat ? "
tr	3	I said , " Both at present . "
tr	1	I said , " I don 't go around advertising it .
tr	0	She said , " No I meant what rank ? "
tr	3	Still it 's on the up and up . "
tr	1	I said , " Be back in a jiffy . "
tr	2	We walked in ; the hall was already filling up .
tr	4	We wandered the aisles chatting as we went .
tr	1	He said , " Don 't rightly know sir . "
tr	1	He said , " I 'd say dress down sir . "
tr	0	I walked up the gangway saluted and came aboard .
tr	2	I looked through the powerful night vision glasses .
tr	4	Fire when ready and keep hammering him . "
tr	1	Once again , night closed in around us .
tr	2	I 'll be around to see you off tomorrow morning .
tr	3	I got out and walked around the front of the truck .
tr	2	I said , " Damn glad you did . "
tr	1	No sir , but we do have a tiny CIC . "
tr	0	I said , " Allan about the armament ? "
tr	4	Therefore , we need to be prepared for any eventually .
tr	2	" Jim how about you , any concerns ? "
tr	2	It is me more than you I worry about .
tr	0	I asked Linda , " Have anything to add ? "
tr	1	She said , " Sir , permission to speak freely . "
tr	2	I told myself George you worry too much .
tr	4	Herb rushed to see what had caused the problem .
tr	1	I saw a sly grin pass over Herbs face .
tr	3	" OK let 's try it again . "
tr	3	Allan sent word that there was a meeting tomorrow at nine .
tr	0	Allan had charts spread out on the table .
tr	1	I said , " Let Herb in on the action .
tr	3	I guess it was left up to the cook .
tr	2	Somebody go and tell the cook to come back in . "
tr	4	" You were right Herbs a go-getter saved the day .
tr	2	Got any more problems I can help you with ? "
tr	0	We 'll start deploying gear in about an hour .
tr	2	Good luck , Joe give it your best shot . "
tr	1	Jim , Herb , Dan can you think of anything ?
tr	1	How 's your side of things shaping up ? "
tr	0	Abe said , " I 'll take care of it ... .
tr	2	Do you think we 'll be OK going into Havana ? "
tr	3	I still see their faces at night and it haunts me .
tr	1	I told him we were going to Hispaniola next .
tr	1	Jim had suggested that all officers be issued side arms .
tr	2	Dan how close are you to having your problems fixed ?
tr	4	I ended with what I hoped would have meaning to Carol .
tr	1	I asked , " Jim what do you think . "
tr	0	I asked Jackson what was passing for a Government .
tr	1	I hurried over to the bridge port bridge wing .
tr	0	Puerto Rico and the US have had a long partnership . "
tr	1	I went down to engineering and returned in five minutes .
tr	1	I said , " Sorry for the interruption . "
tr	4	Gentlemen , the table is now open to discussion .
tr	1	I called on Jim , " Jim . "
tr	2	A tanker full of fuel would certainly let him do it .
tr	2	Well , that 's all we can do for now . "
tr	1	I said , " Can 't it wait . "
tr	1	She said , " Yes sir , no problem . "
tr	1	Saturday rolled around we were dressing for dinner .
tr	0	We weighed anchor and departed the harbor in a gala mood .
tr	1	You have it , I relinquish command . "
tr	1	In a moment , Ned was working on her .
tr	2	I watched it disappear and suddenly felt old and empty .
tr	4	What force was there that could be greater than love ?
tr	1	She said , " He says so . "
tr	1	I said , " Sam I 'm going alone . "
tr	2	I had no idea what the options ashore would be .
tr	4	We checked the complex but found no sign of human activity .
tr	1	I didn 't say anything , just handed Sam the glasses .
tr	4	It was around one thirty before the anchorage became quiet .
tr	0	Sam grabbed a line and swung aboard and I followed .
tr	1	Sam and I fully intend working toward making it happen . "
tr	4	We shoved off and made our way to the ketch .
tr	1	When it quit I said , " Here goes nothing . "
tr	3	I played with the battery connections with no results .
tr	3	There was no telling what useful stuff it might have contained .
tr	1	As they say , enquiring minds want to know .
tr	3	I said , " Don 't trust your captain either ?
tr	1	I just couldn 't get over our luck finding Fantasy Island .
tr	1	As I was telling these guys it 's a long story .
tr	2	We came alongside Homeward Bound with a dingy full of food .
tr	4	We celebrated by opening another bottle of expensive Pinot Chardonnay .
tr	4	" Yes sir , were all OK . "
tr	0	He said , " Hope that 's a good thing ? "
tr	2	We walked in the next morning Allan was all smiles .
tr	2	If you choose , Homeward Bound will be your flagship .
tr	2	Several contractors I know made millions from illegal labor .
tr	2	Sometimes you can 't judge a book by its cover .
tr	2	Many of my close friends worked for G.M. .
tr	2	As we evolve so should models of our economic systems .
tr	1	Next in importance is the instillation of culture and civilization .
tr	1	Punishment in school led to punishment at home .
tr	4	One bad teacher can ruin a generation of young people .
tr	3	Roughly , this is how it translates into practice .
tr	2	In the end , no good can come of it .
tr	4	Factors affecting government like all things change over time .
tr	1	She is giving mankind the ability to act on her behalf .
tr	3	This led to the most startling conclusion of all .
tr	4	Why , simply because it hadn 't been invented .
tr	0	She set to work using what she had on hand .
tr	3	This fact in itself accounts for our accelerated mental evolution .
tr	0	She had watched them play fight as was traditional .
tr	1	They are my children , the children of warriors .
tr	2	Your father is getting old now and slower . "
tr	3	It was quiet but more so than usual this morning .
tr	4	The very jungle seemed to be holding its breath , waiting .
tr	0	~ ~ ~ Chapter 2 Kuching , Sarawak several days later .
tr	0	Jennings was attached to HQ ' A ' Squadron 22 SAS .
tr	0	" What 's he on about Paddy ? "
tr	1	said the Captain walking over to his office .
tr	2	" Jennings suggested we might bring Gema in ... .
tr	1	She smiled as she sat down , carefully smoothing her skirt .
tr	0	they still had heads hanging in the rafters of their home .
tr	3	They had almost no contact with the outside world .
tr	1	an officer and a gentleman , an enigma indeed !
tr	3	Christ we don 't even like admitting that we exist .
tr	4	Plenty of jungle experience in Malaya ... speaks fluent Malay ... .
tr	1	Mason struggled to get his mind on the business at hand .
tr	4	her eyes twinkling well aware of his discomfort .
tr	4	Gema nodded quite prepared to let him speak .
tr	1	" What is it she 's so upset about ? "
tr	2	He didn 't have to wait too long the following morning .
tr	4	" Where the hell have you been Sticky ? "
tr	0	" I 'm glad too , " said Gema .
tr	3	I just didn 't want you to forget that . "
tr	0	She took a step backwards and looked up at him .
tr	3	He didn 't want the ugly world to intrude .
tr	2	" So what have you got for us ? "
tr	4	Robbie , I 'd like you to take the Bren again .
tr	2	" Bloody Yorkshireman , " said Downer laughing .
tr	1	" Gema , will you marry me ? "
tr	2	She stood still looking up into his face .
tr	2	and boss she doesn 't look too good . "
tr	1	Dickie got that sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach .
tr	0	he took her hands in his ... . .
tr	0	She had no way of confirming what might have happened .
tr	4	She felt alone for the first time in her life .
tr	4	We jump together and for God 's sake stay together .
tr	1	Our LZ is the big padi by the river .
tr	4	Apparently there 's no wind which should make it easier . "
tr	0	Navigator will come back and give you a hand . "
tr	2	He disappeared forward and closed the door behind him .
tr	2	Too soon the navigator clambered back from the cockpit .
tr	4	he yelled over the noise of the engines .
tr	2	Sensory overload falling through the gloom of the early dawn .
tr	1	Staying together using arms and legs as flight controls .
tr	4	Release the Bergen on its ten foot line .
tr	4	When you 're back we 'll move out . "
tr	3	Most of them probably got caught in there . "
tr	3	Beyond that the building had collapsed into itself ... ... .
tr	3	His thoughts came back to the river in front .
tr	3	What was left of the body was covered in blue tattoos .
tr	2	George took a number of photographs from different angles .
tr	0	All they had to do now was wait !
tr	2	He stood in the hallway for a moment .
tr	3	he thought , wandering into the spotless kitchen .
tr	3	Smart girl too , he 'd found that out pretty quickly .
tr	1	Funny when you think about it ... . .
tr	4	He had seen her in action , she was formidable .
tr	4	The disagreement had started after Wendy had been accepted by Cambridge .
tr	0	A small wizened man had appeared at their side .
tr	2	" I speak little English but good Malay . "
tr	0	He was barefoot his arms and legs fully tattooed .
tr	4	" We make camp now , hide truck . "
tr	4	Gema nodded her agreement with Wendy looking on in amazement .
tr	3	It is about three hours to the border .
tr	4	Her shoulders were bruised from the pack on her back .
tr	0	Again Gema smiled , she was fond of this little man .
tr	2	The old , rickety docks had long disappeared .
tr	4	The entire site was completely overgrown in secondary growth .
tr	1	Wendy put her arm round her mother 's shoulders .
tr	2	" What are we looking for mum ? "
tr	1	hard to imagine now , " she said wistfully .
tr	0	head bowed down the traditional way of the Barat .
tr	4	The spirits were quiet as they had been before .
tr	3	A little thick but on the green ... ... ... .
tr	1	Other than his business , golf was his second love .
tr	1	Dickie and his wife lived in Hereford ... ... .
tr	4	He usually stayed with either George or Dickie .
tr	2	Flashing lights , yellow tape , ambulance , police cars .
tr	1	Not much blood but left leg and arm in unnatural positions .
tr	1	His business just took off almost in spite of him .
tr	1	~ ~ ~ Chapter 7 A Gentlemen 's Club in Kensington .
tr	2	not a sign of racism ... not bloody much .
tr	0	He always sat with his back to the wall .
tr	2	usually by the shoe boy in the club 's lobby .
tr	0	He certainly wasn 't afraid of hard work .
tr	0	he 'd even run a half marathon ... . "
tr	3	He walked through the door to the restaurant .
tr	2	" That doesn 't look like a bill ... .
tr	1	as though nobody knows , " she said derisively .
tr	2	" Sorry to keep you chaps waiting . "
tr	4	" Were you born there or come from somewhere else ? "
tr	1	All four teed off , all four finding the fairway .
tr	0	" That oriental bastard cheats , " said George .
tr	2	I 'll tell you something else Harry ... .
tr	4	The real crunch came when Gema got ' The Job . '
tr	2	She still felt alien in an alien land .
tr	3	Just south of Rochester he pulled into a truck stop .
tr	0	He walked through Departures and took the escalator down to Arrivals .
tr	1	Avi sat , quietly waiting , nursing his lemonade .
tr	3	The bar started to fill up , not good this .
tr	3	His tradecraft screamed at him to get out now .
tr	3	Tony picked up the tickets and walked out onto the street .
tr	1	" It 's optional , " called Dickie .
tr	1	I couldn 't get into my old uniform if I tried .
tr	2	it was so much easier to look after .
tr	4	Pulling out of the laneway he suddenly stopped .
tr	3	She went back into the house and into his study .
tr	4	Tears sprang to her eyes but she forced them back .
tr	4	her husband ... ... they knew ... ... they all knew .
tr	3	" No pubs , that 's the problem .
tr	0	" Please not him , " she thought . "
tr	4	" I remember you both very well , " she said .
tr	0	hand shaking ... ... back slapping ... ... .
tr	3	~ ~ ~ Chapter 11 A night at the fights .
tr	3	We 'll talk about it then , " he said .
tr	0	Of course Avi had given him an argument .
tr	3	It was just a short walk to the gym .
tr	2	Some of them did it for the money or the notoriety .
tr	4	There were no rules and no ' decision . '
tr	0	He probably could have finished it then but why risk .
tr	2	As he stood Tony gave him a foot to the stomach .
tr	0	The air came out of him with a whoosh .
tr	0	I was sure you might have a contact . "
tr	2	" Room 's soundproofed , " he said to himself .
tr	3	" Let 's get on with it then .
tr	3	Major just sift out the info that 's relevant just now .
tr	0	David stay back for a while would you . "
tr	2	" So how you making out up there Dave ? "
tr	2	" Bored out of my tree , " said David .
tr	2	" Your army contacts still good Dave ? "
tr	2	" Buy a lonely girl a drink ? "
tr	4	She 'd been divorced for a couple of years now .
tr	1	" Nothing serious , bit of business , anything happening ? "
tr	3	She was waiting for him at the counter .
tr	1	" I was Miss , " said one of the uniforms .
tr	4	Relocate the tape at least a hundred yards in every direction .
tr	0	said David , " who the hell is he ?
tr	4	Tell the pro the course is closed until further notice .
tr	0	As far as cause of death ... . .
tr	4	They 'll send back the toxicology report when they 're done .
tr	1	" OK , but you 're buying . "
tr	1	Later , sitting in an alcove in the Dragon .
tr	3	I thought there was something about you . "
tr	2	~ ~ ~ Chapter 14 Moving right along .
tr	1	" Tern Hill Barracks , " was the announcement .
tr	1	" Quartermaster 's stores please , " said Jennings .
tr	1	" Quartermaster , " after a few rings .
tr	1	" George is or rather was Harry 's best friend .
tr	2	A few of them managed to stay close you know .
tr	0	" What a beautiful house , " she said .
tr	2	We fought together in both Malaya and Borneo .
tr	4	" Do you remember the names of the clerks too ? "
tr	0	Do you have any idea what killed Harry ? "
tr	1	Our people in Ledbury couldn 't figure it out . "
tr	3	Other than that that 's about it for now . "
tr	4	I want to see who 's there . "
tr	2	" We certainly tend to go our own ways .
tr	2	Two sides were primarily window looking out over farmland ... .
tr	2	Gema had added her own touch to it .
tr	0	It was her cave ... ... her sanctuary .
tr	0	I have to shower and grab some breakfast .
tr	4	" Hello there Sergeant , please come in .
tr	0	They shook hands each noting the grip of the other .
tr	3	The room was silent , each lost in their own thoughts .
tr	3	" This used to lead to the old servants quarters .
tr	2	Cooking it up is passed down from generation to generation .
tr	2	Good for years so I 've been told .
tr	2	" Careful it 's bloody sharp too . "
tr	4	He fancies you for sure , Jen . "
tr	2	Obviously George had a source of inside information .
tr	2	" What the bloody hell is going on ? "
tr	0	We can have a bit of a chat and swap information .
tr	1	" This sounds ominous , " said the Commander smiling .
tr	4	I 'd like to keep her involved . "
tr	3	Together they saw a lot of action in the jungle .
tr	4	" The way I see it we have two options .
tr	1	I 'm qualified in semi automatic pistol and shotgun .
tr	3	It 's not far and it 's on the way .
tr	4	I 'll be there in about an hour . "
tr	2	" Good that 's all I need to know . "
tr	0	Paddy and Frank had taken a small table in a corner .
tr	1	Commander 's going to be seriously pissed . "
tr	2	They pulled into the parking lot of a busy local pub .
tr	3	Paddy flicked the cigarette butt out of the window .
tr	3	We just have to react to their actions .
tr	4	He smiled at the memory of the red shoes .
tr	0	That was a safety issue but also a damned good investment .
tr	2	I brought you some kit you 're going to need . "
tr	4	He reached into the trunk and brought out a leather case .
tr	0	" What a beautiful gun , " she said .
tr	3	George was hitting his customary twenty to twenty two .
tr	3	It 's a bit lighter and certainly fits your hand better .
tr	1	It was obvious that Jennie was not a beginner .
tr	0	That 's almost the equivalent of a full SAS squadron .
tr	1	He paused , memories flooding into his mind .
tr	1	As for Harry and Peter ... that 's different .
tr	4	I 'm on the Fleetwood ferry heading over to Larne .
tr	2	he asked , " I 'll tell you all about her .
tr	3	They sat at the ancient pine table in the kitchen .
tr	1	She 's involved in some sort of martial arts thing .
tr	2	" Would you like me to stay ? "
tr	1	" What a stunning looking woman , " thought Jennie .
tr	0	They sat facing each other as though sizing each other up .
tr	2	Food for thought wouldn 't you think ? "
tr	4	George picked up his tea and walked out of the room .
tr	0	By now the study was a familiar , friendly place .
tr	1	He was casting his eyes around looking for a suitable victim .
tr	1	" Remind me to pick up a couple of kids gifts .
tr	0	No idea why , his army records show he 's Catholic .
tr	2	Suddenly the door opened , a middle aged lady stood there .
tr	3	Put it down to female intuition she thought .
tr	4	Mr. and Mrs. Mason knew both the deceased . "
tr	1	" Anything else you think I should know ? "
tr	3	Mrs. Mason spends a lot of time with the daughter ... .
tr	1	I 'm still waiting to hear from Robbie .
tr	3	Paddy strolled through the market but could not make them out .
tr	3	Not a bad bet he thought to himself .
tr	4	A pigeon locked in for the night after the evening service .
tr	0	He had the feeling that the church was watching him .
tr	0	On duty was a small guard force plus RAF maintenance personnel .
tr	3	a neat little apartment in a co-op type building .
tr	3	There was still plenty of time to go .
tr	3	They settled in for a wait of about five hours .
tr	4	By now the other two teams should be in place .
tr	4	George had been quiet up to this point .
tr	4	He sensed rather than saw the two men behind him .
tr	3	They tied him to the chair with plastic ties .
tr	2	Slowly the room warmed up as the peat took hold .
tr	1	My name is James , people call me Jimmy ... ... .
tr	3	The nature of that retribution is entirely up to you .
tr	3	For that we simply hand you over to the authorities .
tr	0	" He 's awake , " said Jimmy .
tr	2	John came round to find himself lying on the floor .
tr	2	The effort brought a moan of pain to his lips .
tr	0	he 's come around at last , " said Jimmy .
tr	1	Tony Wei sat in his club in Kensington .
tr	4	Maybe he would be deported but to where ?
tr	4	He could see the locks several hundred yards ahead .
tr	0	He slowed down to almost a walk as he approached .
tr	3	The foot struck him just below the heart .
tr	2	I don 't know about Leeds or Ireland .
tr	3	At least it 's a known quantity ... ... .
tr	1	The biggest unknown is going to be in Brixton ... .
tr	1	" David I want you take responsibility for Tony Wei .
tr	2	" You going to stay here over Christmas ? "
tr	2	" I 'd love to ... ... . .
tr	2	Do we know who 's coming for Christmas yet ? "
tr	3	Traffic was light on this side street off the Brixton Road .
tr	1	" Only one man in the van ... ... ... .
tr	1	confirm as Frank Jennings , let him unload ... ... .
tr	0	" Yorkshire and Ireland you have a go .
tr	1	We 're coming in now ... ... . .
tr	2	The lobby was cloudy with dust from the explosion .
tr	1	" Tony Wei and Frank Jennings ... ... .
tr	2	I suppose he could be long gone by now .
tr	3	I think that 's about it for now .
tr	0	This place was like an island ... ... .
tr	3	She had met Robbie for the first time just last night .
tr	3	that was the nature of the team . "
tr	2	" I hope that 's Bowmore , " said Robbie .
tr	1	" Now it even sounds like Christmas , " she said .
tr	2	He walked out of the room the dogs following .
tr	2	" Bloody dogs follow him everywhere , " said Robbie smiling .
tr	4	Jennie just sat contentedly watching the flames flicker .
tr	3	I wouldn 't want him getting into trouble ... ... .
tr	1	" Och man it 's beautiful , " said Robbie .
tr	0	probably more than I make in a year . "
tr	1	They found him in the canal in Market Drayton .
tr	4	" We had everyone under surveillance ... . .
tr	4	asked George his breath curling away into the night .
tr	4	Three people dead now that we personally know .
tr	0	Their names are actually Terry and Margaret . "
tr	3	He looked up at them quizzically , Margaret started to blush .
tr	1	By now the spicy smell of Christmas was pervading the house .
tr	0	She was beautiful twenty years ago and she was still beautiful .
tr	0	youthful and hard but it was Wendy that caught him aback .
tr	0	She was tall , as tall as her father .
tr	3	Did you get to talk to Wendy at all ? "
tr	3	David got to talk to Wendy quite a lot though .
tr	2	" How could you miss them ... . .
tr	1	she 's a stunning looking young woman . "
tr	1	I 'm surprised I had room for anything after yesterday . "
tr	3	They might well be right but I 'm not comfortable .
tr	1	I 'd rather be safe than sorry , Terry ... .
tr	1	" Sly bastard , " was Robbie 's only response .
tr	2	see you in a day or two . "
tr	2	Check on the proximity alarms in the woods ... ... .
tr	2	Thanks to you my collection has almost doubled in size . "
tr	2	I told her about you quite some time ago .
tr	1	George was doing the driving with Jennie sitting up front .
tr	0	David and Jennie sat down in arm chairs facing the Asian .
tr	2	" Bullshit , " George from the corner of the room .
tr	0	He frowned at the man looking back at him .
tr	1	He slowly dressed in front of the mirror .
tr	2	Beneath the photos a cardboard box , an old shoe box .
tr	3	He lifted it out , it was heavy .
tr	1	He slowly moved forward soundless and almost invisible in his camo .
tr	4	He knew he was within range of the sensor .
tr	0	The blow took him behind the right ear .
tr	1	Showing her warrant card they went in through the front door .
tr	3	They stood in the entrance to the study .
tr	1	Dick was sitting in his armchair by the cold fire .
tr	1	It certainly looks like a suicide but ... ... .
tr	3	It had started to snow again blowing in from the west .
tr	3	it 's snowing pretty hard just now . "
tr	2	George walked straight down the corridor to the guest rooms .
tr	2	George stood up and poured them both a drink .
tr	4	Can 't just hold a defensive position for ever ... ... .
tr	2	She knocked on the door of the main house .
tr	3	" I 'm not sure that I know Sergeant ... .
tr	0	She flew out three days ago via Kuala Lumpur .
tr	1	You 're just helping us with our enquiries .
tr	1	she 's in the cop shop just now . "
tr	1	I arranged it with him in England . "
tr	1	I am Guru Muda as is my mother .
tr	2	I apologize for sounding so callous but I have little option .
tr	4	Brenner and Downer were part of a fire team .
tr	1	" Do you know a Frank Jennings ? "
tr	3	" I don 't have a problem with that .
tr	4	Her parents , life in the Orang Ulu ... . .
tr	4	She went straight home ... walked all the way .
tr	0	He was sure he had it with him .
tr	2	I would say they probably belong to someone from the Kalimantan .
tr	3	It 's really tough , maybe the toughest in the world .
tr	1	" I think we have the link ... a connection .
tr	4	Give me a bell when you 're back in town . "
tr	2	Didn 't she say she wanted to go up to London ?
tr	0	Here 's what I think we should do .
tr	0	the lady with the big gun , " he said laughingly .
tr	2	" He 's probably still plucking up courage .
tr	0	I thought he was going to crap himself .
tr	1	He now knows about Brenner , Downer and Dick .
tr	2	She obviously doesn 't know about her father .
tr	0	She 'd quickly packed a bag and left .
tr	0	It was a chance she was going to have to take .
tr	3	" Too fast , too fast , " she thought .
tr	2	Mrs. Thompson 's hollow voice responded from the speaker .
tr	4	There were cameras in every room plus cameras outside .
tr	2	" If you speak I will shoot you .
tr	1	You know I think Robbie was getting a little pissed .
tr	1	" She never had any intention of killing me you know .
tr	0	I 've no idea what she 's talking about . "
tr	3	Tony slept intermittently his head falling to his chest .
tr	4	She turned her hands out , palms to her own face .
tr	2	For years I wondered who it could possibly be .
tr	4	Withdraw to a spot where you can eyes on the vehicle .
tr	2	It 's almost like full circle , please come out . "
tr	0	We can stay at the Brecon Castle again ... .
tr	0	The dart took him high on the left shoulder .
tr	4	The figure came at him in a lightening blur of speed .
tr	0	The startling blue eyes glared at him out of the balaclava .
tr	3	The characters and events portrayed in this book are fictitious .
tr	1	Finally I am leaving , a disillusioned wife and mother .
tr	2	Can I be so bold to continue this dream ?
tr	1	Faro did not care for her or for his four-year-old daughter .
tr	4	I could see his eyes were always seeking the captain .
tr	0	She is married , a lady of good means .
tr	1	But I can dream , even if it is futile .
tr	4	He swayed on his feet , his eyes bloodshot .
tr	0	A sailor and a lady are absolutely unsuited .
tr	4	He was strong and enormous in size but I fit perfectly .
tr	3	It felt so right , although it was wrong .
tr	0	My Cisco , her hand on his arm .
tr	1	I saw the fury raging in his eyes .
tr	3	She found me talking to that slave girl .
tr	2	I cannot allow him to suffer on account of us .
tr	1	He is a gentle , kind and loving man .
tr	0	But I had to make sure he was okay .
tr	3	But that kiss told me what he felt .
tr	3	But we both know it was a not to be .
tr	0	But he said he would not harm his own crew .
tr	4	He slapped her and dropped her on the deck .
tr	2	No doubt she was one of the favorites .
tr	1	His skin split open as blood seeped from his wounds .
tr	2	He was covered in his own blood from the shoulders down .
tr	0	He roared in agony and four men carried him away .
tr	0	When I reached him he had a high fever .
tr	1	I brought some ointment and tended his wounds .
tr	0	I made him as comfortable as I could .
tr	3	I could attend to him and touch him often .
tr	2	I really hope the ship will hold up .
tr	3	There are so many things I still want to show him .
tr	1	At twenty-four she knew her future would be colourful and beautiful .
tr	2	They had lived on it and had survived its worst .
tr	2	With only the Contra O Vento coming in she was worried .
tr	2	I will speak to all of you . "
tr	4	Cisco put the letter down and reached him in one stride .
tr	3	" Let me look at that leg . "
tr	0	" What has happen to you , Jean ? "
tr	1	" It is a long story , my friend .
tr	1	Calm down and tell us what is going on .
tr	0	With a whinny he was ready for action .
tr	4	The more she read , the angrier she got .
tr	2	It will all depend on how quickly you can deliver .
tr	3	She had to read the letter twice to understand the contents .
tr	2	" You have to leave tomorrow morning early .
tr	2	She stamped her foot in frustration on the marble floor .
tr	3	My heart wants to beat out of my chest .
tr	1	I cried for the first time in my life .
tr	1	Rosa - Lee is blossoming with him as her father .
tr	3	But that was only the start of our journey .
tr	4	He saved me when Faro wanted to rape me .
tr	4	Those days were filled with horrific scenes of death and survival .
tr	1	His whole family was endangered by one man 's insanity .
tr	2	" I will go get some warm water , Doctor .
tr	3	" I will not send my only daughter to that place .
tr	1	Cisco raised his voice in frustration and anger .
tr	4	Cisco gathered her closer , her face pressed into his shoulder .
tr	1	standing on her tip toes , she kissed his handsome face .
tr	3	This was not the time to be a hero .
tr	0	" Mama , please , don 't make it so hard .
tr	0	You and Papa have taught me everything you know .
tr	2	The outcome can be devastating for both you and Pedro . "
tr	0	She held her mother 's hands , kissing them .
tr	1	" I will be back with Pedro , I promise . "
tr	4	Her life would depend on her skill and alertness .
tr	3	I can hardly wait for this little one to come .
tr	2	My protruding tummy is a joy for Cisco .
tr	3	In disgust I watched as they ate it just like that .
tr	0	Again , people ate it and got stomach cramps .
tr	3	Cisco thought it wise to take me away .
tr	1	Captains barked out commands to their scurrying crews .
tr	0	The small , streamlined frigate lay waiting in the calm water .
tr	1	Roberto saw the fury and it drew him .
tr	1	This will be an interesting time with her aboard the ship .
tr	4	Her bodice clung to the small frame in the latest fashion .
tr	4	Her perky breasts looked ripe for the plucking .
tr	0	His guffaw rumbled up his throat , mocking her .
tr	3	Without a word , she turned to wave to her parents .
tr	4	He muttered something and the man looked away with a smirk .
tr	4	He was quite likeable , considering the predicament she was in .
tr	3	I might just as well make the best of it .
tr	3	" I refuse to eat with that man .
tr	1	I do not want any contact with him in anyway .
tr	3	" I don 't want to discuss this any further .
tr	0	" Can I at least have water ? "
tr	4	" No , " came the abrupt reply .
tr	0	The captain 's cabin lay two doors down the passageway .
tr	2	" How long do you think she will hold out ? "
tr	4	In the , end she will be mine without a question .
tr	3	That Roberto was up to something was very clear to him .
tr	3	Still today , I thank God for that .
tr	0	Afterwards I knew she had no chance with him .
tr	0	No matter how exhausted he was I was always his priority .
tr	0	With shaking hands she finished the water in one thirsty gulp .
tr	0	She had held out for three hot days .
tr	3	" Without a doubt , " she snapped .
tr	0	" Enrico is preparing a bath for you as we speak .
tr	2	Now she could not look at the smirk on his face .
tr	0	It was her first time taking a voyage again .
tr	4	Their feelings became stronger over the period of time .
tr	3	The captain sat at the head of the table .
tr	0	His mother was also beautiful as a young woman and gentle .
tr	4	Yes , this woman intrigued him on a completely different level .
tr	1	The next morning when I found her I was angry .
tr	1	The once brusque and impatient man turned into a loving father .
tr	0	That was my train of thought all awhile Cisco was gone .
tr	3	It was not the same group that left with him .
tr	4	He stood there , dumbfounded at the sight he saw .
tr	0	At that stage I was a walking skeleton .
tr	0	My once soft black hair was all tangled and without life .
tr	3	Now we can laugh about it but then it was serious .
tr	3	A few still able to think with clarity reacted immediately .
tr	0	" I held on to him with everything that I had .
tr	3	This was a contrast to everything she knew about this man .
tr	0	He had a beautiful , calming voice : strong and steady .
tr	0	" I have heard that many times . "
tr	0	She thought as she watched his retreating back .
tr	0	How fortunate I am to have my family .
tr	3	But it does not bother me at the least .
tr	3	To see Cisco this happy is more than worth it .
tr	4	We wandered through that wilderness in a daze .
tr	1	He made no sound and no eye contact .
tr	3	" It ran into trouble after a storm .
tr	2	We will be on the lookout for any pirates .
tr	2	" Thank you , Sir , and goodbye . "
tr	4	" I have looked everywhere but I cannot find her . "
tr	2	The man in front of him was not easily fooled .
tr	2	" Did you look on every deck ? "
tr	4	" What are you not telling me , Enrico ? "
tr	0	" She is on the other ship ! "
tr	4	" I realize that , but we have no choice .
tr	0	" Who says she didn 't talk already ? "
tr	2	" I will go alone , " Roberto said .
tr	4	The rest of the group scattered in a different direction .
tr	4	I knew she loved me but she never showed it openly .
tr	0	7 August 22 , 1624 Today was exceptionally warm day .
tr	0	Alfonso arrived a week ago and is helping him .
tr	2	Alfonso had no qualms about resigning from his old ship .
tr	1	Previously another woman just wanted his name for her unborn child .
tr	0	I wish them all the happiness in the world .
tr	0	He thought the last four days had changed things .
tr	0	Fool that he was , he had trusted her .
tr	2	What could she do on the ship , surrounded by ocean ?
tr	0	She will pay for this foolishness he thought once again .
tr	4	We need to get away while there is still time . "
tr	2	Would she be all right among the sailors ?
tr	3	He did not want to think about it .
tr	0	The pain and loss was unbearable at times .
tr	3	These were the thoughts that he struggled with .
tr	2	My father will kill me if I lose her . "
tr	2	" No , Pierre , you know he will not .
tr	4	" Are we still getting her from the ship ? "
tr	1	I don 't want anyone else in danger . "
tr	0	He and Pierre had talked about that in detail .
tr	1	His soft snores a sure sign of deep sleep .
tr	4	The normal military alertness and precision were not evident .
tr	1	Men were hanging in their hammocks , snoring .
tr	0	The small manicured hands were a dead giveaway .
tr	3	For a brief moment he just took in the sight .
tr	4	She trembled with fear , yet was happy she was back .
tr	0	When his second-in-command appeared , the conversation gave it all away .
tr	1	I will find that bastard and kill him . "
tr	2	They muttered angry words , words she could not understand .
tr	1	Sunlight drenched the cabin , streaming in from large windows .
tr	2	" Do you want to say something ? "
tr	2	" You cost me two days , " Roberto continued .
tr	2	" Roberto , what are you going to do ? "
tr	3	It did not matter how hard they were .
tr	0	He had to be strong and punish her .
tr	2	Roberto looked at him , annoyed , his face blank .
tr	3	I don 't want the crew to hear . "
tr	4	Roberto kept his eyes on her as they moved away .
tr	2	Enjoying the joy of motherhood and new life .
tr	1	This time his anger was aimed at himself .
tr	3	That in itself I found very odd at the time .
tr	2	He told me not to do something foolish and to hide .
tr	0	" And I suppose you have a plan ? "
tr	4	Please , Roberto , we need to help them . "
tr	3	" I saw the charts on the table .
tr	4	While they were talking they leaned on it .
tr	3	Walking to his table , she pointed at the open chart .
tr	4	We are going on a rescue mission ! "
tr	4	I myself almost died as I reached the fort .
tr	1	I didn 't notice this or go to her aid .
tr	0	I was afraid that I would not see you again .
tr	4	" Tell me the story , " she whispered .
tr	1	She was fighting , refusing to recognize it .
tr	0	He could understand why she was fighting it .
tr	4	The winds look good , " Pierre reported after a while .
tr	3	She was not only beautiful but very intelligent too .
tr	0	If he had half a chance , he would pursue her .
tr	3	Roberto thought his heart almost stopped at the ridiculous plan .
tr	4	" Do you have a better idea ? "
tr	3	But she brought out the best in him .
tr	4	When Pierre looked at him , Roberto scowled .
tr	1	His second smiled and continued with the conversation .
tr	1	And again that unknown feeling coursed through him .
tr	1	To show so much of herself was a first .
tr	4	He seemed ugly as his eyes ran hungrily over her body .
tr	0	She had to fight the shivers running through her .
tr	0	" My good captain , finally we can meet .
tr	2	Did she have to make it look so good ?
tr	4	Why were you on my ship in the first place ? "
tr	3	Is there anything that we can do for you ? "
tr	0	" Can I ask who you are ? "
tr	1	Pierre 's hand was almost touching the soldier 's hat .
tr	2	Good-bye , and a safe journey to you . "
tr	3	The rescuers thought it wise to withdraw quickly .
tr	3	But she brought out the best in him .
tr	3	That in itself was a thought that kept him awake often .
tr	1	His second smiled and continued with the conversation .
tr	1	And again that unknown feeling coursed through him .
tr	1	To show so much of herself was a first .
tr	0	She had to fight the shivers running through her .
tr	0	" My good captain , finally we can meet .
tr	2	Did she have to make it look so good ?
tr	3	Sailors scattered around as they started to do their daily chorus .
tr	3	Is there anything that we can do for you ? "
tr	0	" Can I ask who you are ? "
tr	1	Pierre 's hand was almost touching the soldier 's hat .
tr	2	Good-bye , and a safe journey to you . "
tr	3	The rescuers thought it wise to withdraw quickly .
tr	4	Respect and discipline were of the utmost importance .
tr	0	" The captain that led us was a cruel man .
tr	4	She dabbed away the moisture from her eyes and continued .
tr	4	Out of self-defence , Father had to kill him . "
tr	4	The people had a great respect for him .
tr	3	" It was painful to see them in that state .
tr	0	She swallowed again at the memories of that man .
tr	1	" His way of life finally caught up with him .
tr	4	" Will you ever go back there ? "
tr	4	She tried desperately to untangle herself but it was futile .
tr	2	Getting his footing , Roberto laid the lifeless body down .
tr	2	Blood streamed from her shoulder and Roberto gasped softly .
tr	2	Roberto watched as the doctor worked on her .
tr	2	" I owe you thanks for saving me . "
tr	4	" Can I give you some water ? "
tr	4	" You need to give me some time .
tr	4	He covered a yawn as he entered his own cabin .
tr	1	" My shoulder hurts , " she said hoarsely .
tr	4	And he kissed her on the cheek " This is real .
tr	4	She wiped the salt water from her body .
tr	4	She listened intently , enjoying the food set before her .
tr	0	She was now more aware of him as a man .
tr	4	Over the past few days she and Roberto became good friends .
tr	4	Immediately he rushed up to the upper deck .
tr	4	Anger filled Roberto when he realized what was going on .
tr	0	When Roberto caught up with him he was seething .
tr	2	" You were out of line , sailor . "
tr	3	The lady is not interested in you , you rat !
tr	1	We will deal with him in the morning . "
tr	2	Roberto said in a low , cold tone .
tr	1	" Again , my hero , " she said , smiling .
tr	1	" It 's becoming a trend now . "
tr	2	" When are you going to talk to me ? "
tr	0	All he saw was trust , and could it be ?
tr	4	Careful curiosity filled them as he watched her .
tr	4	He lowered his head and brushed against her lips .
tr	1	" Does that means it is a yes ? "
tr	3	She had to admit she wanted more than just this .
tr	0	And what would her parents say of this sudden marriage ?
tr	1	Questions poured through her , bringing her back to reality .
tr	4	She tried to move away but he did not let her .
tr	2	You know how I feel about them . "
tr	3	" That is not your biggest concern though ? "
tr	2	She could not lie to him or be dishonest .
tr	2	His authoritative voice left no room for argument .
tr	0	He chuckled as his mouth once again captured her mouth .
tr	4	" You are conceited , Mr Pirate . "
tr	2	One shoe fell with a thud on the floor .
tr	3	" Did you really think that those lashes would stop me ?
tr	1	" I promise I will have you . "
tr	4	The sailor 's head was in between her legs .
tr	0	He just held her as she clung to him .
tr	0	She could hear his heart racing , echoing her own .
tr	1	She nodded softly , numbness in her limbs .
tr	4	The memories of the previous night came back in a flash .
tr	2	" I vowed to protect you , " he said .
tr	3	" I do not feel like that right now . "
tr	4	" I will get Enrico to get you a dress . "
tr	1	" I want a dress , Roberto . "
tr	0	A man 's holy place , her father had once said .
tr	1	And she loved it would not change it for anything .
tr	0	Do you think all pirates are ignorant ? "
tr	1	" You are quite surprising for a pirate . "
tr	0	" I am glad to have the lady 's approval . "
tr	0	" I am glad to hear that . "
tr	2	" I 've caused a lot of problems for you ? "
tr	4	He walked to his desk to collect some water for her .
tr	2	" I know , but you are safe now .
tr	0	It was still hard after all these years .
tr	2	" I am so sorry for your loss . "
tr	0	It was a very long time ago . "
tr	3	" Don 't you want to tell me ? "
tr	2	Enrico knocked and she quickly took the food from him .
tr	0	She gasped , placing a hand on his arm .
tr	4	" I was nineteen , my sister twenty-one . "
tr	1	Two months later she became sick with morning sickness .
tr	2	The cargo was of much importance to the Falcon .
tr	2	Your brother 's stories didn 't do you justice .
tr	4	She came closer , opening herself to him .
tr	2	My body had no other choice but to follow . "
tr	1	" For a pirate you are very romantic . "
tr	3	There was nothing that could compare to this bonding .
tr	3	It was as if they could not get enough .
tr	3	All was forgotten except to just live for the moment .
tr	2	Pierre would tell of his bravery on many occasions .
tr	4	Because there would be no mercy once he was caught .
tr	1	He said she was brave but she was not .
tr	1	She had no doubt in her mind any more .
tr	3	With trembling hands she started to push him to the side .
tr	4	It startled her and she blushed , keeping her face down .
tr	4	The exploring of their tongues ignited fire in them both .
tr	1	Roberto was in a blissful state of his own .
tr	3	He wanted to tell her so much but could not .
tr	0	He groaned and crushed her mouth with his again .
tr	3	The only law that counts is the Falcon 's .
tr	0	His character was not that of a pirate .
tr	0	That is all I can say for now .
tr	3	But it was easier to speak to her than Roberto .
tr	2	Her body was adjusting and aroused under his raw desire .
tr	2	She had to wait on board for him .
tr	2	But he could not afford to turn around .
tr	4	What she had done to displease him they could only guess .
tr	1	" Roberto , I trust you are well ? "
tr	4	" Pierre , " Falcon acknowledged him briefly .
tr	1	The Falcon 's dark eyes glimmering with satisfaction .
tr	2	" Well let me hear all about it ! "
tr	2	" Now look what you have done , you idiot woman .
tr	1	He was ruthless in his endeavours and vicious to any captive .
tr	2	" You don 't offer much , Roberto .
tr	0	The patrols are canvassing the island as we speak . "
tr	3	It was the not knowing that drove her to pacing .
tr	4	The crew was on alert all the time .
tr	1	Tension hung like a thick , unseen blanket in the air .
tr	4	He was also a good man and the crew respected him .
tr	0	He had a self-assurance about him that made him attractive .
tr	0	He laughed easily and was pleasant to talk to .
tr	0	Her waist was cinched small , according to the latest fashion .
tr	4	Men watched her , following her with greedy , hungry eyes .
tr	1	" Where is my brother , you bastard ? "
tr	2	" Your brother will come when I am good and ready .
tr	0	He brushed away her hair , cupping her breasts again .
tr	4	She felt humiliated , exposed to every hungry glare .
tr	2	You bloody bitch , you 've had sex ! "
tr	3	Roberto was quiet all the way to his hut .
tr	0	We thought the chief was a good man .
tr	0	And she comforted him , his head on her shoulder .
tr	0	" I am going to be a father ! "
tr	4	" How can I refuse that request ? "
tr	2	" I love you , my Rosa . "
tr	0	He crushed her body against his , demanding her mouth .
tr	3	To fight for their future was worth everything .
tr	4	Quickly , they introduced themselves to the young girl .
tr	4	Nora was already at the edge when they were stopped .
tr	2	" You will not touch her again , Falcon .
tr	1	Both knew they had the same cunning and skill to win .
tr	0	Both had a roguish grin on their faces .
tr	1	Grabbing the sword , his face was stunned .
tr	2	" You wounded me , you son of a bitch ! "
tr	0	She waited for him as he moved forward again .
tr	1	One man grabbed Nora , holding his sword under her chin .
tr	2	Looking at Nora , they lowered their swords .
tr	0	" A pirate with a wife , what a laugh ! "
tr	2	Are you going to marry her too ? "
tr	0	" My men saw your brother at Santa Apollonia .
tr	3	Both are so pretty , don 't you think ? "
tr	1	" I am tired of you slapping me .
tr	4	She left Roberto 's arms and threw herself into his .
tr	2	He would be a good husband to her .
tr	1	I just do not understand what is going on .
tr	2	" Would you like to sit down ? "
tr	4	He rose to his full height , towering over her .
tr	2	" What would you like to know ? "
tr	1	" There are a million questions racing through my mind .
tr	3	Start at the beginning , I guess . "
tr	3	It was a wonder this one was still intact .
tr	1	She raised it to her mouth and took small sips .
tr	4	He smiled at her and her eyes were fixed on him .
tr	4	Roberto placed a kiss on her nose with a conceited smile .
tr	1	" Hi , sister , " Pedro said sheepishly .
tr	4	Your secret would have been safe with me . "
tr	0	" You are very brave , Captain . "
tr	1	He brushed against her plum lips , sighing in contentment .
tr	2	I am going to make an effort to court her .
tr	2	I am going to be a farmer from now on .
tr	3	" I have found the will that your father left .
tr	3	The Captain handed two letters over to him .
tr	2	His father was not one to mince words .
tr	0	It told him how much they had missed him .
tr	0	What if he did not accept him as her husband ?
tr	0	With a sigh , she opened her warm mouth .
tr	2	" You don 't play fair , " he pouted .
tr	2	" Well , are you going to talk to me ? "
tr	2	" He will not shoot you , Roberto .
tr	4	He is loving and caring , everything you are as well .
tr	1	She placed another kiss on his plump lips .
tr	2	" You taught me , so don 't complain . "
tr	2	You are making it too much of an issue .
tr	2	" Were you looking for me , Rosa ? "
tr	1	His light blue eyes filled with suspicion and surprise .
tr	1	" Papa , I must introduce you to my husband . "
tr	1	" Step aside , sister , " he hissed .
tr	1	" Manuel , you don 't understand ! "
tr	1	" What is this pirate doing here ? "
tr	2	" But child , he kidnapped you . "
tr	0	He came back later and joined them again .
tr	3	Roberto swallowed at the lump in his throat .
tr	0	He could only shake his head at his own stupidity .
tr	3	It was an enmity that led to war .
tr	1	Yet this decision was fraught with its own difficulties .
tr	2	" No good will come of this . "
tr	4	He remembered back to his lord 's youth .
tr	1	" I do not understand , " replied Finan slowly .
tr	0	As always , Finan , you are correct . "
tr	0	Rafe grinned and relaxed back into his chair .
tr	4	Finan 's eyes fell on the first line of the missive .
tr	1	" You begin to understand , I think . "
tr	1	Lord Brogan 's disapproval would be weighing heavily on his mind .
tr	3	Do you not think that your father is right ? "
tr	3	" I take it that your father did ? "
tr	3	" Then you must do as you think best . "
tr	2	" I happen to be your only son , sir . "
tr	1	Rafe shifted his weight awkwardly and pulled on his tunic .
tr	4	Rafe hesitated , fingering the sheathed knife on his belt .
tr	3	' Tis not my wish to hurt you . "
tr	0	Rafe grasped his father 's hand tightly in his own .
tr	1	" What is your business here , sir ? "
tr	3	" I am here to visit the fort . "
tr	4	The voice was sharply bracing and Rafe suddenly rediscovered his tongue .
tr	4	" She must be well taken care of .
tr	3	She stood abruptly , indicating that he was to follow her .
tr	2	" Now I will take you to your chamber .
tr	2	" I shall have some food sent to you . "
tr	0	Although what more they could give her she did not know .
tr	3	It was the chest that contained Lord Rafe 's letters .
tr	0	Lord Rafe was a kind , generous man .
tr	0	What was he going to do with her ?
tr	1	The poor girl ... this must be alarmingly new for her .
tr	2	In truth he seemed unconscious of his good fortune .
tr	0	He shook his head , surprised at his own thoughts .
tr	0	He also noticed that she brought with her another young lady .
tr	1	She was very beautiful , as striking as Adele was subtle .
tr	3	It might not be too bad after all .
tr	0	His mother would ... Great goodness , what was he thinking !
tr	0	" Why do you call him Charger ? "
tr	0	" Charger and Valiant , and what may I call you ?
tr	3	Now the problem was how to tell her the truth .
tr	1	Illumination broke like a sunrise in Adele 's mind .
tr	4	He would tell her the moment they gained his border .
tr	2	Rafe began to drag wood together , ignoring Eda 's outburst .
tr	2	" Those provisions are from the fort ! "
tr	3	Rafe saw nothing in that fact to weep over .
tr	2	" But ... how will you cook it ? "
tr	0	Eda grasped his arm and tried to pull him away .
tr	4	" Leave her be , let go you brute ! "
tr	1	Its savoury smell reminded him that he was still hungry .
tr	1	He broke off , shaking his head in dissatisfaction .
tr	0	His voice was bitter , his face strangely haggard and troubled .
tr	2	If you stop you will not survive . "
tr	2	" You mean if they do not kill you ? "
tr	1	" Could you not run with us ? "
tr	0	When the attack came it was sudden and loud .
tr	1	The gloominess was frightening , closing over them with disorientating thickness .
tr	0	She looked up at Rafe again but his face was thoughtful .
tr	2	" All is well , " assured Rafe .
tr	1	" Not if you will not believe it . "
tr	1	Rafe 's eyes narrowed , swift suspicion filling his mind .
tr	0	" Are you suggesting that I am heavy ? "
tr	2	" But , Adele , ' tis all so vile ! "
tr	0	" You have said that already , dear . "
tr	1	" The village is built upon a hill and is extensive .
tr	0	He had been going to say that Finan had startled him .
tr	2	" I hope you did not hurt yourself . "
tr	3	" No ' tis naught like that . "
tr	3	It was simply that it was not his secret to confide .
tr	3	Not that they hadn 't listened to him with respect .
tr	0	" I was thinking , " answered Rafe apologetically .
tr	4	" You are worried , " shrugged Adele .
tr	3	It is not pleasant to be always troubled . "
tr	1	" You are a very unusual girl . "
tr	2	" You do not think Lord Rafe will mind ? "
tr	1	" You think he will like it , Finn ? "
tr	0	He was gone again , lost to her as a companion .
tr	1	She didn 't speak again , did not question him .
tr	4	She stole a look up at him from beneath lowered lashes .
tr	1	" I think it would be best if we dismount . "
tr	2	" Or take me down with you ! "
tr	4	" You are wet through , " Rafe noted .
tr	0	Adele smiled up at him , laughing again .
tr	3	Finan : at that moment pretending to be Lord Rafe !
tr	1	She bore no signs of being a star crossed lover .
tr	3	" They do not , but it makes little matter .
tr	2	We shall be upon them soon enough , Bron . "
tr	0	" You said that yesterday , Master Rand . "
tr	4	Rand pulled on the reins and wheeled his horse about .
tr	1	asked Finan , his large frame stiffening slightly .
tr	4	Just the fragrance alone made him feel warmer .
tr	1	Finan answered , not missing his queue this time .
tr	1	" Yes , yes : what is it ? "
tr	2	" I do not think you would . "
tr	2	" No , I suppose I would not . "
tr	0	" Say Finan , are you alright ? "
tr	0	" What was he doing here anyway ? "
tr	3	" But for my father that is not enough .
tr	1	Competing with one another in friendly rivalry was one thing .
tr	2	" You should get out of the rain . "
tr	4	" Eda , be silent , " whispered back Adele .
tr	0	" Fine , " assured Eda , looking away .
tr	4	Still , it was a very strange experience .
tr	3	It was not really a question but a statement .
tr	4	" Well , yes , " answered Adele guiltily .
tr	4	" Well ... we played with them . "
tr	1	For some reason this last seemed monstrously unfair .
tr	2	" How long ago did you meet him ? "
tr	4	Adele turned eyes that sparkled with excitement toward him .
tr	3	" Anyone must see that the situation is difficult . "
tr	3	" That our betrothal is ... difficult ? "
tr	2	" You could not tell , Adele ? "
tr	2	Adele broke off not knowing how to form the question .
tr	2	" She did not die , no . "
tr	2	" How did you reach that conclusion ? "
tr	2	" Of what problem do you speak ? "
tr	1	It was Adele 's turn to look surprised .
tr	2	" But it was you who spoke of it ! "
tr	4	" You remember my telling you that I heard horses ? "
tr	4	Bless Adele and the day on which she had been born !
tr	1	" Yes , thank you , Finn . "
tr	2	" He could not possibly ... " Bron swallowed .
tr	4	He lifted his hand and the dagger flew from his fingers .
tr	1	Finan rubbed his hand over his face and neck , yawning .
tr	3	" ' Tis no matter , lad . "
tr	3	It was a statement , not a question .
tr	0	" Almost as traditional as war between Mercia and ourselves . "
tr	2	" Do not we all upon occasion ? "
tr	4	The cloak inched down a little and Eda regarded her speculatively .
tr	2	Eda slowly pulled herself upright , giving a groan .
tr	0	" Why are you in such a hurry anyway ? "
tr	4	She was startled to hear his voice when he spoke .
tr	2	" Look ; Finn forgot to take his breakfast . "
tr	0	Did he wish to make her hate him ?
tr	3	" It is not what you think . "
tr	1	I know Lord Rafe would never kill an innocent man . "
tr	4	" We were banqueting in the king 's hall . "
tr	1	So stupid , such a pointless waste of a life . "
tr	0	What happened was not Lord Rafe 's fault . "
tr	3	Whose fault is that if not Lord Rafe 's ? "
tr	2	This conversation must end now , before one of us . "
tr	4	Adele called back , but she hesitated and did not leave .
tr	4	" Adele ... " " Adele , are you coming ? "
tr	1	Her voice was calm but filled with warning .
tr	3	That must surely be enough to satisfy you ? "
tr	3	It seemed to him that they contained a sympathy of sorts .
tr	2	She did look different from usual he had to own .
tr	0	Be assured that Lord Rafe is more than capable . "
tr	2	" Think how proud your father would be ! "
tr	2	Rafe looked around at the many hoof prints .
tr	1	" At least six horses with riders . "
tr	4	" I can see where they reined the horses in . "
tr	1	" Finn , should we not ... ? "
tr	2	Charger followed and soon both horses were out of sight .
tr	1	" What is your business upon them , stranger ? "
tr	4	" Whip the dog for his impudence , " he demanded .
tr	0	Adele had escaped ... to him that was all that mattered .
tr	3	The chair directly across from him caught his attention .
tr	1	Some would say ' tis no less than you deserve . "
tr	3	Do not think that I treat the thing lightly .
tr	2	" You think I care ought for your explanations ? "
tr	2	" So now you think to shirk the blame ? "
tr	4	" He seems a little naïve , Brother . "
tr	3	The youth strolled lazily forward to stand next to the fire .
tr	2	" What do I do with you ? "
tr	4	" They are , very unpleasant , " replied Rafe stiffly .
tr	2	" Your family is bound together by love and affection .
tr	3	" That is it , is it not ?
tr	3	What if they hadn 't made it to the border ?
tr	1	" You still suppose this is about love .
tr	3	" That is what this is all about ? "
tr	3	" It has nothing to do with perception !
tr	0	My grandmother and great-grandmother 's names are above it . "
tr	3	" Two horses continued in that direction . '
tr	3	" Then Lady Adele is without protection . "
tr	3	" Something that I do not understand . "
tr	1	" The warrior is of secondary importance . "
tr	1	" Bring the warrior to me alive . "
tr	2	" You are upon occasion useful to me , Bron . "
tr	2	Bron did not know , nor was he likely to ask .
tr	4	------- Adele snuggled closer to Charger 's neck .
tr	2	Adele hardly noticed ; all she could think of was Finn .
tr	3	She didn 't really want to think about that either .
tr	2	Have you forgotten those who follow us ? "
tr	3	Adele felt that she was doing the right thing .
tr	0	Adele caught Eda 's arm as she made to dismount .
tr	3	Chapter Sixteen Finan gazed out into the mist .
tr	3	" What is it that we are looking for ? "
tr	1	" Come , Finan , what is it ? "
tr	1	" Perhaps I might direct you to your final destination ? "
tr	3	Silently he lead them through the camp to his tent .
tr	2	Adele took the opportunity to go to Charger 's head .
tr	3	" But you must have thought something . "
tr	3	" Well if that is not just like you ! "
tr	2	" What more do you wish me to say ? "
tr	0	" What did you say your name was ? "
tr	1	Finan shook his head and sat motionless , listening as well .
tr	2	It took Rafe no more than a second to recognise him .
tr	2	I should have known that it was you of course . "
tr	4	Adele did worse than argue , she ignored .
tr	2	" For goodness sake , will you not end it ? "
tr	2	" If not more , to lose . "
tr	3	Go back to the tent and rest . "
tr	0	" What do you want , Rand ? "
tr	3	" Just a little of your time . "
tr	4	They will be returned to you when you leave . "
tr	2	" Come , I will show you . "
tr	3	Rand knew that Adele thought him to be Finan .
tr	0	They had been friends , or so he had thought .
tr	4	Other than Adele , for she is already taken . "
tr	0	" Speak plainly , Rand , I am tired . "
tr	0	Rand lifted his hand in a placating gesture .
tr	2	" And how did you reach that conclusion ? "
tr	3	" That is not what this is about . "
tr	2	" She has no need of your comfort ! "
tr	2	" You could have come back to us . "
tr	2	They had no choice but to obey my father 's command .
tr	1	" Is she still in danger from your father ? "
tr	3	" The truth is that I do not know exactly .
tr	3	" The men who attacked us at the first camp ? "
tr	2	" Very well ; is that all ? "
tr	0	Rafe groaned and ran a weary hand across his forehead .
tr	3	" I had forgotten about that , " he admitted .
tr	1	" Finan , you did not surely ? "
tr	2	Finan choked over the words that flooded to his lips .
tr	3	Had you better not tell Lady Adele the truth ? "
tr	2	" Very well , but allow me to say this . "
tr	2	Perhaps it would even be wrong to do so .
tr	0	" What do you say , Finan ? "
tr	4	Finan 's pale eyes met those of his friends .
tr	0	" Lady Adele said that you had been captured ! "
tr	0	Not that he could accurately remember that which he had said .
tr	3	" I am little , not stupid ! "
tr	2	" Would you care for something to eat , Master ?
tr	0	" I have heard nothing of this . "
tr	4	" It seems then that we should prepare for war . "
tr	1	" Even enemies can find unity in a common cause . "
tr	1	King Ine twisted his beard around his finger .
tr	2	" What do you think , Brogan ? "
tr	2	" How do you propose to do that ? "
tr	3	" They are not to be trusted . "
tr	4	" My liege must do as he sees fit . "
tr	3	He cast the parchment on to the table .
tr	3	I lost my uncle , Mul , to the Kentish revolt .
tr	3	------ Adele lay staring at the walls of the tent .
tr	0	Why had no one warned her of this ?
tr	1	Why had Lord Rafe put her in this impossible position ?
tr	2	Finn looked out into the mist shrouded camp .
tr	3	" He had not slept in two days ! "
tr	4	Either way there was going to be trouble .
tr	1	His temper , always so easy , was pricked .
tr	0	Behind him he could hear the sounds of pursuit .
tr	3	" But , Master , they approach too fast !
tr	0	" Now I am almost afraid to . "
tr	1	" ' Tis ... difficult to explain . "
tr	3	Not so much at first , but later . "
tr	0	Rafe sat upright , holding his head in both hands .
tr	2	There was nought any of us could do . "
tr	1	" It is time to forgive , Rafe . "
tr	4	They walked to Rand 's camp in silence .
tr	1	" How is Finan , any change ? "
tr	0	The aggravation had made the wound bleed again .
tr	0	" He would not , why should he ? "
tr	4	" When do you expect the fever to break ? "
tr	2	" You think we should move within your boundaries ? "
tr	3	" But there is something I must do first . "
tr	0	" Are you ready , my lady ? "
tr	3	" He wants to talk to us now ? "
tr	2	" Finn , are you out of your senses ? "
tr	4	" Very well , Finn , " she smiled nervously .
tr	0	Had she said something that had displeased him ?
tr	4	Her cheeks suddenly blanched ; had he known ?
tr	2	Could he do nought without making it worse ?
tr	0	All his life he had known what to do .
tr	3	Eda stared at her , trying to accept the information .
tr	4	Adele brushed the back of her hand across her face .
tr	3	" I thought that we liked Finn ? "
tr	2	" How did you do it , Eda ? "
tr	0	Eda shook her head trying to clear her thoughts .
tr	0	Either way , his manner had changed abruptly .
tr	4	She lifted her free hand to rest upon Adele 's .
tr	1	I will fight him with every means at my disposal .
tr	1	Rafe shook his head , his shoulders sloping tiredly .
tr	0	Rafe scowled and turned back to his task .
tr	2	" What would you have me do ? "
tr	4	" There is no harm in asking , " he replied .
tr	0	I have a mind to lay claim to her myself .
tr	4	" Am I being insufferably ill tempered ? "
tr	1	In most things Rafe was completely open with Finan and himself .
tr	2	He took another look at his friends face .
tr	0	It was a gamble asking so direct a question .
tr	1	First Adele calmly indicating that his audience with her had finished .
tr	1	Rafe groaned again , digging his fingers into his scalp .
tr	1	" There is something amiss , sir ? "
tr	1	Great goodness , would it always be thus ?
tr	2	We know not what more to do for him . "
tr	0	" Since yesterday night , my lady . "
tr	2	" Do you think they will come back ? "
tr	1	Adele 's hand was still pressed against Finan 's brow .
tr	3	" Trust a man to make things difficult . "
tr	3	Adele smiled gratefully at this attempt at humour .
tr	1	Eda straightened from her awkward position with difficulty .
tr	0	It was the young man that had brought her here .
tr	4	Her eyes met his , large , wondering , and soft .
tr	2	Rand opened his mouth to speak but no words would come .
tr	0	He had done nothing of which he was ashamed .
tr	0	Damnation , it always came back to that .
tr	1	They had only been girls , very young and very innocent .
tr	0	He should have realised that something like that might happen .
tr	3	He felt quite sick just thinking about it .
tr	4	It had made him feel important and clever .
tr	0	How much affection he must have had for the sick man .
tr	4	" It reminds me of easier times . "
tr	0	" I was happy too , Rafe . "
tr	4	Adele disconcerted him by remaining silent for some time .
tr	2	Rafe stood , moving out of her way with reluctance .
tr	4	He felt a sudden and unaccountable pride in her .
tr	3	" I do not think that likely . "
tr	2	" But it would help you too ! "
tr	2	" Why do you want him dead ? "
tr	2	" How was I to know he was not Lord Rafe ?
tr	2	He looked wildly from one to the other of them .
tr	4	He looked weak , but the fever had left him completely .
tr	0	" As though an army had marched over me .
tr	0	Finan looked up at Rafe as though he had gone mad .
tr	2	Of whom do you suppose he was speaking ? "
tr	0	" He would not have let it weigh with him .
tr	1	" I could almost think you like him , Rafe . "
tr	4	" Come , Rafe , surely there must be someone ? "
tr	4	" Well then , who else is there ? "
tr	1	It is a far more serious thing . "
tr	4	He turned quickly , but knew already what he would find .
tr	2	" How do you feel , Finan ? "
tr	1	" I think perhaps it would be unwise . "
tr	2	" I do not wish to trouble you . "
tr	2	" You know , I do not think I shall . "
tr	4	" I rather think you will , " he observed .
tr	0	Finan shook his head , casting Adele a wary glance .
tr	2	You mean you actually are going to go to sleep ? "
tr	3	But no , it was a risk he could not take .
tr	3	He did not wish her to pull away at the liberty .
tr	4	" I must remember to convey my thanks to her . "
tr	2	Rafe said nothing but his brows drew together ominously .
tr	0	" What have you been thinking of all this while ? "
tr	1	" Nothing very much , " replied Lord Brogan .
tr	2	" Only about that boy of mine . "
tr	2	Brogan , who placed so much more store by diplomacy .
tr	3	It was almost as though the boy was taunting him .
tr	2	" We will show those boys how ' tis done .
tr	0	Brogan snapped his fingers and a page appeared at his elbow .
tr	2	" How long will it take to rally your men ? "
tr	3	" I had not thought to take them . "
tr	4	" I will send for them at once . "
tr	3	" It will be just as it used to be .
tr	0	That which others saw of him was that which he was .
tr	2	" No doubt you now regret our bargain ? "
tr	2	" Ask and I shall tell you . "
tr	2	" Very well , what was it ? "
tr	2	" I am proud of you , Rafe !
tr	0	It was no longer a playful catalogue of tricks .
tr	1	" You think it none of my business ? "
tr	2	" I do not understand , how did you ... ? "
tr	1	" I had it from his own lips . "
tr	0	" What a shock he must have had ! "
tr	4	" You knew he had a master then ? "
tr	2	" What possible reason could he have for killing you ? "
tr	2	" Nothing , only much to lose . "
tr	0	" Very well , his actions are not sane anyway .
tr	4	" He wishes to see the body . "
tr	2	" And what do you propose to do with him ? "
tr	0	" I have already taken command of his men . "
tr	4	" It seems you have thought of everything . "
tr	4	" And when shall I meet her ? "
tr	1	" ' Tis my lady who has shown kindness .
tr	2	" I would have the truth from your own lips . "
tr	4	Would she give him the chance to explain ?
tr	2	" There is nothing to forgive you for .
tr	1	It was Rand 's comfort she had sought and not his .
tr	1	Put quite simply this whole thing was driving him to distraction .
tr	3	He would speak plainly to her and set matters straight .
tr	4	" Yes I do , so please let me . "
tr	1	Its purpose was that you should be kept safe . "
tr	0	" Because I wish only that you might be happy . "
tr	3	Rafe gritted his teeth and gripped his hands tightly together .
tr	2	" Then you wish our betrothal to proceed ? "
tr	2	" How came you to know of that ? "
tr	2	" How came he to know of it ? "
tr	2	" You will be careful , Finn ? "
tr	4	He held her still , preventing the escape .
tr	3	" It matters to you that I am careful ? "
tr	1	" The kiss , I ... I liked it very much .
tr	0	It was Adele who came to his aid .
tr	3	" Anything to set my lady 's mind at rest . "
tr	1	Adele 's lips twitched into a mischievous smile .
tr	3	' Tis enough to turn a man 's stomach . "
tr	0	" See that you stay close to Finan and Rand . "
tr	1	The quiet subservient slant of his shoulders was gone .
tr	1	Your men are surrounded , as are you .
tr	2	Yield or I shall be forced to kill you . "
tr	0	" Always the same , are you not ? "
tr	0	His anger would have consumed my family also . "
tr	0	" May I accompany you , Rafe ? "
tr	0	" You think he might come back to harm them ? "
tr	3	It had not been his intention to attach her feelings ?
tr	1	Rand stepped backward in surprise , waiting for her to continue .
tr	3	" Are you trying to insult me yet further ? "
tr	1	Rand stared at her blankly , not understanding her anger .
tr	1	His voice sent an unpleasant chill down her spine .
tr	2	" Did I do something to anger you before ? "
tr	2	" Do you think that you could like me again ? "
tr	3	" That is ... you do not understand . "
tr	1	He paused , his voice coming with difficulty .
tr	2	If you count me worthy , I would be yours . "
tr	0	" I can be quite a handful ! "
tr	2	Eda laughed , playfully slapping him on the shoulder .
tr	4	He turned to the soldier who held the horse 's reign .
tr	4	" Yes , I had expected to find Rafe present .
tr	0	Lord Brogan waved his hand in an airy gesture of dismissal .
tr	2	Lord Brogan did not look like his son , Adele decided .
tr	1	" Is he off on this wild chase as well ? "
tr	1	Lord Brogan was silent as he absorbed these facts .
tr	2	" You look well , Lord Brogan . "
tr	2	Lord Brogan looked his lost foster son over slowly .
tr	4	" I fear you will never recover from the experience . "
tr	4	Adele hesitated , not wishing to leave Lord Brogan alone .
tr	4	" Were you happy at the fort , Lady Adele ? "
tr	4	" Yes , I was very happy there . "
tr	4	" He cooked us pork over the campfire . "
tr	2	Lord Brogan nodded sadly , his eyes filled with grief .
tr	2	" Yes ; you look very much like your mother . "
tr	1	" You will make Rafe a good wife , I think .
tr	2	" You look tired , Rafe , " Lord Brogan commented .
tr	2	" What do you do here , sir ? "
tr	0	" How much have you told him ? "
tr	4	" Because Adele was given to me and not to him .
tr	3	" But that was not the whole reason ? "
tr	1	Lord Brogan gifted his son with a warm smile .
tr	0	" It takes a brave man to admit his mistakes .
tr	1	" Such hate as he possesses will not fade .
tr	2	Why does Tom know so much about these people ?
tr	0	Okay , maybe I was a tiny bit .
tr	1	Grass tickled my ankles , and I gripped his hand tighter .
tr	0	So maybe it wasn 't a boat ride .
tr	2	He shifted his weight from foot to foot .
tr	0	In my fantasies , this date was about me .
tr	1	" Yeah , I know it was kinda stupid . "
tr	1	Cider splashed out of the plastic , fluted glass .
tr	2	" Why do you think -- " " Whoops . "
tr	1	Some of it splashed out on his jeans .
tr	0	He snorted , trying to hold back his laugh .
tr	3	My heart fluttered , but I stayed on task .
tr	0	" Was that an admission of guilt ? "
tr	0	I cleared my throat in a judicial sort of way .
tr	1	Except for the blood running in rivulets down his arm .
tr	0	He groaned again , and I ran to his side .
tr	1	I was a nice girl having her first date in Paris .
tr	3	Things like getting shot didn 't happen in situations like that .
tr	2	I knew exactly how this would look to the police .
tr	1	I kept pressing the quilt against his arm .
tr	2	" Do you know who might 've shot you ? "
tr	2	A bit of drool clung to the corner of his mouth .
tr	2	" We need to get you to a doctor . "
tr	1	" It 's just a grazing , I think . "
tr	2	I hooked my arms under his shoulders and pulled .
tr	0	That was why I never heard the gun shot .
tr	1	I said in a tiny , scared voice .
tr	4	" We need to run , " he said .
tr	2	Or what if you pass out from blood loss ? "
tr	0	He held his breath and grimaced with pain .
tr	0	Or I could do as Malcolm wanted and run away .
tr	1	A cramp gripped my side , but I kept pushing .
tr	2	Someone touched my shoulder with a soft hand .
tr	1	It would be hard to miss a guy in his underwear .
tr	3	I 'd stayed up late into the night , worrying .
tr	1	Why did I act so impulsively last night ?
tr	2	He had no idea I 'd almost died last night .
tr	0	More serious than whatever drama he was reading about .
tr	0	Dad sat straighter and his voice became sharp .
tr	4	" Did you say the Eiffel Tower ? "
tr	1	Not if I ever wanted any kind of social life again .
tr	0	" You could say it was an adventure . "
tr	0	And I had to see about a body .
tr	2	I nodded and downed a glass of water before slipping outside .
tr	2	I sprinted to the corner before slowing to a jog .
tr	2	" Oo la la , you look terrible ! "
tr	1	I leaned forward and nibbled on my croissant .
tr	3	I didn 't want to talk to Aimee about my date .
tr	2	And then slowly backed out of our friendship ?
tr	1	I couldn 't handle losing my only friend .
tr	2	He did not show for work this morning . "
tr	2	" I 'll tell you on the way .
tr	1	Wanting to know what was wrong without wanting anything back .
tr	3	Then I told her the rest , almost .
tr	1	I talked about his admission of guilt and the mock trial .
tr	4	Then her lips twitched , and her eyes crinkled .
tr	3	A part of me wished I 'd told her the truth .
tr	4	Not even a bit of yellow police tape was visible .
tr	0	Aimee asked , a hand on my arm .
tr	1	Even if I did , what did it matter ?
tr	1	A serving tray could possibly save my life .
tr	1	Newly spun webs clung to my face and neck .
tr	2	His wild red hair and acne scars just added to it .
tr	1	No chairs or tables or water coolers were in sight .
tr	0	I made a mental note to stay away from him .
tr	4	The smell of bat excrement made me feel positively sick .
tr	0	Maybe I 'd end up in a hospital next to Malcolm .
tr	4	Aimee whispered , " You can do this . "
tr	0	Dad took full advantage of everyone 's gawking stares .
tr	2	It 's your job to follow the clues and save him .
tr	2	Joy burst through my veins and flooded my body .
tr	3	I was stuck until it was time to drop .
tr	2	Dad boomed out their names as they dropped down .
tr	0	Six Dad cleared his throat after an awkward silence .
tr	0	That distraction came in pieces of colored candy .
tr	0	A special tag allowed me to bypass buying a ticket .
tr	0	Only a small bench with black padding decorated the room .
tr	1	And I wasn 't in the mood to explain .
tr	1	With a dramatic flourish , I finished off the wings .
tr	3	" You might want to work on that accent . "
tr	3	" Your fake British accent isn 't much better . "
tr	0	The lady glanced back at her team and shrugged .
tr	4	Then I dug into my satchel and handed her an envelope .
tr	2	" The least you could do is say you 're sorry .
tr	3	After that we both turned to our easels .
tr	3	I had to completely turn away before I throttled him .
tr	3	It was my turn to splatter him with paint .
tr	1	With one final yank , I ripped it from his hands .
tr	3	I 'd forgotten to throw out the rest of my Skittles .
tr	4	Or they were because their informant wouldn 't be here .
tr	1	Tips of skyscrapers poked at the sky in the distance .
tr	3	I squinted and my heart dropped straight to the ground floor .
tr	3	The lady slipped into the crowds like any other tourist .
tr	4	Someone tugged on my coat , but I brushed them away .
tr	0	She tucked a strand of graying hair back into her bun .
tr	4	She seemed a little unsure , so I nodded .
tr	2	I so wasn 't in the mood for his ' tude .
tr	2	He sent a youngish woman from his group over to me .
tr	3	Dad had strict orders to not help them out .
tr	4	Her look softened and she grasped my hands .
tr	0	That was all she could say to me ?
tr	3	Hide it in a closet or better yet , burn it .
tr	0	" They probably already know you are in France .
tr	0	They could have spies watching us right now .
tr	4	They already took a dear friend of mine .
tr	3	I won 't let them take you too . "
tr	3	We had a museum to visit and lattes to drink .
tr	3	I thought Mr. Bent might have an alternate plan for you .
tr	2	" You were both probably in on it .
tr	2	" You need to find your group . "
tr	3	I started it when I brought candy into the Louvre . "
tr	2	That is no reason for him to lose it . "
tr	3	" That would be nice , but no . "
tr	2	" I am going to follow him . "
tr	2	Maybe you should -- " " Dad ? "
tr	4	No answer except the empty silence of a lost connection .
tr	3	I shut the phone and jammed it into my bag .
tr	4	It seemed to always come back to him .
tr	1	And he wasn 't singing show tunes either .
tr	4	" Get in the chair , " I answered .
tr	2	Peyton towered in the doorway , but no group .
tr	3	Not a good sign that he split from his team .
tr	2	" You can 't stop me now ! "
tr	2	" You 're supposed to stay with your group .
tr	4	I 'm sure they need your help . "
tr	4	He puffed out breaths while cracking his knuckles .
tr	0	I wish I could change what happened . "
tr	1	" You think this is a joke ? "
tr	3	" Don 't even think about it . "
tr	0	I had no idea what to say to him .
tr	2	The door to the storage room slammed shut .
tr	0	Pain shot through my head , radiating out from my cheek .
tr	2	" You should 've stayed out of this . "
tr	2	Peyton dropped to the floor , writhing in agony .
tr	1	" What 's going on in here ? "
tr	0	Dad kicked the crate out of his way and approached Peyton .
tr	2	Cards fluttered only to settle on the wooden floorboards .
tr	0	Nancy and Gray both arrived , breathless and with flushed faces .
tr	2	I nodded , all words trapped in my throat .
tr	2	Maybe Dad would ship me off to boarding school .
tr	4	Aimee must have forgotten to meet me here .
tr	0	With light steps , I headed down the narrow hallway .
tr	1	A draft ruffled the ends of my hair .
tr	2	I wasn 't going to tiptoe around my own home .
tr	2	I stopped and swayed , a bit dizzy .
tr	3	Whatever it was , Mom didn 't want me to know .
tr	2	Nancy nodded , but her whole body drooped .
tr	3	The staff gathered their stuff and filed out .
tr	2	I couldn 't lie my way out of this one .
tr	3	" We had a strict contract with the museum .
tr	1	I 'll scrub their floors for a year . "
tr	1	And I thought I 'd hid it so well .
tr	1	He missed Mom just as much as I did .
tr	2	I know you mock some of the clients .
tr	0	Dad 's voice was sharp , and I stopped babbling .
tr	2	Dad pulled out a letter and handed it to me .
tr	1	My hand shook a little bit as I quickly read it .
tr	4	" Aimee is very responsible , " I continued .
tr	2	You 've always said to follow our instincts .
tr	1	" I admit her leaving is a bit strange .
tr	1	But instinct is different than an overactive imagination .
tr	2	You 're too close to this to see properly . "
tr	0	I traced circles on the arm of the couch .
tr	3	He started to say something , then stopped .
tr	2	Normally , I loved when Dad left early for work .
tr	3	I had to get him out of our apartment .
tr	2	My hand wavered and so did my confidence .
tr	4	He sipped his coffee , his eyes still on mine .
tr	0	" Just waiting to hear back from a friend . "
tr	1	" Anything I can do to help ? "
tr	0	Unless you have a crystal ball or a magic wand . "
tr	0	A hot kiss totally makes me want a second date .
tr	4	Why did he keep acting like we worked together ?
tr	2	" Your dad was supposed to leave you a note . "
tr	1	" I met with your dad this morning .
tr	2	How could my dad sign someone so soon ?
tr	3	Okay , working with him might not be that bad .
tr	2	Twelve I found the note confirming Malcolm 's story .
tr	0	I placed my hand on his arm to shut him up .
tr	2	I couldn 't leave until I was absolutely sure .
tr	3	" You want to talk about it ? "
tr	2	Don 't forget gloves for the bat poop . "
tr	3	" But you don 't believe that . "
tr	3	Time to get this out in the open .
tr	3	That usually doesn 't happen on my first dates .
tr	1	I just wish the kiss had lasted longer . "
tr	2	" I can 't tell you all my secrets . "
tr	0	As soon as he said that , he pulled back .
tr	3	Now it 's time to get started . "
tr	1	" She 's basically telling us to scram .
tr	3	Malcolm muttered , " She 's on the attack . "
tr	4	I made gingerbread cookies and the kettle is on .
tr	4	Maybe you can talk sense to her . "
tr	0	She probably lost her husband in a war long ago .
tr	1	" No , no , nothing like that .
tr	4	She borrowed a sweater of mine last week .
tr	4	I mustered the most sugary voice I could .
tr	4	I begged to differ with the flowered apron .
tr	3	I took the stairs two at a time .
tr	1	" What 's our next lesson , boss ? "
tr	2	" No ticket reservations or books on Europe or hotel reservations .
tr	0	I was ready to spy -- I mean train a spy .
tr	4	He pulled an innocent baby face quite effectively .
tr	1	I strode across the room to his private filing cabinet .
tr	0	" Why are you spying on your dad ? "
tr	1	After several minutes of jiggling , I handed it to him .
tr	2	" Okay , I showed you how to do it .
tr	3	" I don 't feel right about this . "
tr	1	" This is the only way to find Aimee .
tr	1	I flipped through the files and found P quickly .
tr	4	He must have had a teleconference and forgotten .
tr	1	" You couldn 't unlock the filing cabinet . "
tr	1	Strand by strand , I pulled microfibers from the rug .
tr	0	Spy Games was popular and doing well , wasn 't it ?
tr	3	I thought about Mom 's money stashed in the closet .
tr	1	Malcolm found my hand and entwined his fingers with mine .
tr	2	I closed my eyes and listened to Dad 's words .
tr	1	The tall brick buildings were built for tourists and quick money .
tr	2	Malcolm focused on the front of the building .
tr	4	" Do you think Aimee could be here ? "
tr	0	I wasn 't exactly a pro at breaking the law .
tr	0	" You saw how psycho Peyton was yesterday .
tr	0	" Was he mad at Aimee too ? "
tr	1	" Because sitting in this bush kinda sucks . "
tr	0	" What if he 's in the room ? "
tr	2	Good for us , but possibly terrible for Aimee .
tr	2	Okay , peeking at Dad 's files didn 't count .
tr	4	Maybe he had already used some of it on Aimee .
tr	1	" This isn 't a Clue game , " I said .
tr	1	Rip open the seam a tiny bit and shove it in .
tr	1	Malcolm gripped my arm and held me back .
tr	2	" What the hell are you doing in my room ? "
tr	0	I said it as casually and friendly as I could .
tr	1	Is this how they do things in Paris ? "
tr	1	I didn 't bother to give him a dirty look .
tr	2	" I guess we got off on the wrong foot . "
tr	3	" That 's one way to look at it . "
tr	3	" Why don 't we talk about this ?
tr	1	" I did not ruin anything , " I argued .
tr	0	Color crept up his neck and across his face .
tr	4	Because soon the police will be after you .
tr	3	Malcolm started to talk but I cut him off .
tr	3	" I don 't want to talk about it . "
tr	1	And by tonight I might be in jail .
tr	1	I 'd pissed him off , but I didn 't care .
tr	1	His lips tightened and a muscle twitched in his jaw .
tr	0	I blinked away my tears and hardened my face .
tr	2	" Don 't you have to go to work ? "
tr	1	Flannel nightgowns are highly underrated , soft and comforting .
tr	3	Why did I have to take that guy 's picture ?
tr	1	I didn 't hear you come in . "
tr	3	" It 's just hot in here . "
tr	2	" Your mom would have to explain that . "
tr	3	" So the split isn 't permanent ? "
tr	2	Finally , he said , " Only time will tell . "
tr	1	I blinked back the tears blurring my vision .
tr	0	When Mom , Dad and I were a family .
tr	2	I 've got some paperwork to catch up on . "
tr	0	He turned his back to me , his shoulders hunched .
tr	3	I didn 't want to be that girl anymore .
tr	1	I sensed a conspiracy and didn 't like it .
tr	1	He continued , " Which I 'll forgive .
tr	1	" How come I wasn 't involved in this decision ? "
tr	0	Dad backed away with his hands in the air .
tr	3	Time to prove I wasn 't about to fall apart .
tr	4	He caught my eye and my stomach fluttered .
tr	2	" Atmosphere has nothing to do with romance . "
tr	2	Are you going to divulge our afternoon plans ? "
tr	0	" Tall , dark hair , an obnoxious swagger .
tr	0	Halfway across , Malcolm stopped and the bridge creaked .
tr	1	I groaned , my fingers digging into the railing .
tr	2	I found nothing but fox dens or rabbit holes .
tr	4	" You might as well take in the view .
tr	0	" Tell me again about our wedding day . "
tr	3	I just about lost my breath when he said that .
tr	1	For once I didn 't have anything to say .
tr	0	Maybe , just maybe , I could call him a friend .
tr	3	" Are you still wearing that stupid tray ? "
tr	2	I huddled close to Malcolm , trying to shrink from sight .
tr	3	" What if this wasn 't Peyton ? "
tr	1	" This might be about my mom . "
tr	4	I saw him on the other side of the bridge . "
tr	1	" I didn 't say I was going to share it .
tr	1	" My biggest fear is failing my dad .
tr	2	I clasped my hands together and fiddled with my fingers .
tr	1	This was my most embarrassing moment , for sure .
tr	2	Moments passed , and we didn 't say a word .
tr	4	" We should be okay to leave . "
tr	2	The once happy blooming flowers in the window boxes drooped .
tr	2	At first , I stood in the doorway and observed .
tr	1	Why didn 't I think to bring rappelling hooks ?
tr	4	I 'd seen enough spy thrillers with my dad .
tr	1	" Just visiting Marie 's granddaughter , Aimee . "
tr	4	The lived-in feeling of a teenage girl 's room .
tr	4	I walked the streets , a pile of nerves .
tr	3	What the hell was my mom getting paid to do ?
tr	3	I wasn 't sure if I wanted to know the truth .
tr	1	He said professionals as if the word was synonymous with royalty .
tr	2	" Do you know who I am ? "
tr	2	The throng of adoring fans all laughed too .
tr	2	He dropped his voice low so only I could hear .
tr	0	Shaken , I stumbled away until I found my table .
tr	1	With a silly grin , I stood behind my masterpiece .
tr	4	The force of something leaving the camera pushed my body back .
tr	1	I murdered a famous pastry chef in a foreign country .
tr	3	I didn 't want to stick around to find out .
tr	0	My legs gave way , and I stumbled backward .
tr	2	A door to the right was cracked open .
tr	1	Hairs instantly stuck out across my arms and down my legs .
tr	3	The butler eventually had to stop and take a breath .
tr	1	I tried to pick out what few words I might recognize .
tr	2	And if I did that , I shuddered to think .
tr	1	I flipped it around , a gigantic smile on my face .
tr	4	I needed to keep our distance so I could think clearly .
tr	0	" Heard you made it through to the Extravaganza finals . "
tr	2	Relief flooded my arms and legs , and my body sagged .
tr	1	Better yet , my mom wasn 't an assassin .
tr	3	Honestly , winning that contest is about impossible .
tr	0	What would I have to do at the Extravaganza finals ?
tr	4	He pulled out grapes , bread , cheese , and champagne .
tr	3	Hopefully it wasn 't drugged with truth serum .
tr	2	And if I didn 't answer what would he do ?
tr	4	I 'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself . "
tr	2	Obviously he was going with the not-so-subtle approach to questioning .
tr	2	" What do you want to know ? "
tr	1	I tried to act as sincere as I could .
tr	1	It was more like business trip after business trip .
tr	3	I know a little bit about obsessive parents . "
tr	4	I can 't believe someone knocked him out . "
tr	0	Why would you think he 's bad ? "
tr	0	" But that was a week before the Extravaganza .
tr	1	He couldn 't have known , " I said .
tr	2	" What did you discover about your mom ?
tr	0	You can 't leave a guy hanging . "
tr	1	He responded by lifting my chin with his finger .
tr	4	He moved closer until our lips were inches apart .
tr	4	He jerked away , breaking from our light kisses .
tr	1	" My mom isn 't a spy . "
tr	4	" We haven 't even talked about my dad yet . "
tr	3	That was when I decided it was my turn to spy .
tr	3	And what did that have to do with me ?
tr	3	But I couldn 't ask him to repeat it .
tr	2	" How long did you know her ? "
tr	1	Dad asked from his slumber on the sofa .
tr	2	I smoothed down my black shirt over my black pants .
tr	4	He lowered the file , his eyes fixed on me .
tr	1	" I had a good feeling when I hired him .
tr	2	Not only on Peyton , but now on Malcolm .
tr	1	What does a guy like him do in his spare time ?
tr	3	With a slight turn , the door opened .
tr	1	I sank into one of his kitchen chairs .
tr	0	Did I really want to know what he had on me ?
tr	4	I scrolled down but the text was complete gibberish .
tr	1	I couldn 't read it if I tried .
tr	1	I was sure she didn 't need much convincing .
tr	4	" Last summer I climbed Mt. Everest . "
tr	0	I hoped her bra was old and ratty .
tr	3	um ... stopped by to talk about Spy Games .
tr	2	I 'll have to get it to you tomorrow . "
tr	2	" You live close enough to walk ? "
tr	2	Malcolm asked as he followed her to the door .
tr	2	His kind of talking probably meant torture of some kind .
tr	0	" What are you doing sneaking around my place ?
tr	3	" I was just trying to get to know you .
tr	1	I was so tired of being lied to .
tr	4	The smell of old carpets teased me from the hallway .
tr	3	I struggled , but he was too strong .
tr	2	What the hell is going on , Malcolm ? "
tr	1	" I can 't , " I whispered .
tr	1	" I want to find my mom ... and Aimee .
tr	0	That was exactly what Mom had said to me .
tr	1	Jiminy crickets , he was spying on my family .
tr	2	" You don 't have to worry about her . "
tr	1	" I 'm so outta here , " I said .
tr	3	I want you stop the games and work with me . "
tr	3	" I didn 't want to scare you . "
tr	1	His story had more holes than Swiss cheese .
tr	2	I stuck out my hand , and we shook on it .
tr	4	He really shouldn 't have believed anything I said .
tr	2	Jolie didn 't want me to focus on him .
tr	2	He must be off on some devious mission of death .
tr	2	It wasn 't too big or too small .
tr	3	But I didn 't hear anything like that .
tr	4	They didn 't seem to be having a friendly conversation .
tr	2	I fought the urge to sneak through the window for proof .
tr	2	" How nice of you to drop by .
tr	0	Is that your neighbor who baked them ? "
tr	1	I did miss one tradition I 'd started in Paris .
tr	4	Any resolve I had to be 007 disappeared .
tr	3	" I thought you might know something about that .
tr	1	Considering you 're making her grandmother be your servant . "
tr	2	I stood up and inched toward the side .
tr	2	His boisterous laughter made my blood run cold in my veins .
tr	1	I put my hands on my hips for emphasis .
tr	2	" You can call the police if you 'd like .
tr	2	" They probably know you because you paid them off . "
tr	4	He opened the door and pushed me toward the small opening .
tr	3	Just a little payback for the tranquilizer dart . "
tr	0	I didn 't need a sugar crash later in the day .
tr	2	Or he 'd take over and lock me in my room .
tr	2	" How 's the new route coming along ?
tr	4	Are we ready for Spy Games this weekend ? "
tr	4	But I had no idea where the money came from .
tr	0	Maybe I learned my conversational tactics from him .
tr	2	What do you want me to do ? "
tr	2	" And perfect timing , " Dad said .
tr	2	And we 're on a mission for your dad . "
tr	2	I shook it off along with Malcolm 's arm .
tr	0	" Yeah , but it 's a church .
tr	0	" Isn 't this the church famous for the hunchback ? "
tr	4	He sneaked a glance at me and smiled .
tr	3	In that moment , I wanted to tell him everything .
tr	3	Trust me , the climb is totally worth it .
tr	3	Just climbing the stairs will take two hours ! "
tr	2	An echo of footsteps behind us also stopped .
tr	0	A man in a suit coat stood a couple feet away .
tr	0	Malcolm passed him an envelope , probably a payoff .
tr	4	A permanent chill had descended on my shoulders .
tr	0	The cathedral was a no go for Spy Games .
tr	0	And I didn 't care as long as I found Aimee .
tr	4	I gripped the straps of my backpack and studied the house .
tr	2	The neighbors wouldn 't question a visitor opening the backdoor .
tr	0	A girl 's jacket lay across a worn plaid loveseat .
tr	0	A chess game sat on the table , half played .
tr	1	Family times with my mom and my dad .
tr	2	A good spy does not let emotions cloud her mission .
tr	3	At the top , I could go right or left .
tr	4	A deep growly voice , one that I recognized .
tr	4	Thirty-one Please , please go into the bedroom .
tr	4	The whistling entered the bathroom , and I cringed .
tr	1	Terrible foreboding images flashed through my brain , scarring me forever .
tr	2	Jolie spit out directions and rushed out of the bathroom .
tr	2	I couldn 't rip my eyes away from the photo .
tr	4	I 'd felt guilty because our relationship seemed focused on me .
tr	4	No deep conversations -- unless they were about me .
tr	3	I didn 't want to think about it .
tr	2	In front of a giant hole in the floor .
tr	4	My eyes widened as I took in the room .
tr	0	The passageway was short and opened into a small cavern .
tr	2	Construction tools were candy to someone like Malcolm .
tr	2	Jolie was paying Malcolm to torture a prisoner ?
tr	3	What kind of trouble could a pastry chef get into ?
tr	4	I studied the yellowish hue of Malcolm 's face .
tr	4	She would have more than a crease if someone had died .
tr	1	My body shivered as my wet clothes pressed against my skin .
tr	0	And that 's why Malcolm infiltrated Spy Games and my family .
tr	1	I brushed against limestone walls and sloshed through squishy mud .
tr	2	Almost at the top , voices echoed from below .
tr	3	I should go , but listening was too tempting .
tr	2	" You don 't have to worry about her .
tr	1	" She is not capable of infiltrating your organization . "
tr	2	" What would you like me to do with her ?
tr	2	A pompous jerk and a tad bit too emotional .
tr	1	I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood .
tr	1	Legs burning and pain shooting through my chest .
tr	1	Their arms froze in position with frosting tubes in their hands .
tr	4	A girl 's toes are her best weapon !
tr	3	I left them behind and sprinted out the front door .
tr	2	Of course , I had no plans of stopping .
tr	2	I dodged and ducked tables and Parisians out for a stroll .
tr	2	" Okay , I 'll try another one .
tr	2	I had to sneak in and look for you .
tr	1	And that 's dangerous territory entering a girl 's bathroom . "
tr	0	Did he think I couldn 't see through his act ?
tr	3	You must be tired of talking about Spy Games .
tr	3	Why did you ask me out that first night ?
tr	0	Was it to spy on my family ? "
tr	1	I grabbed his shirt and pulled him close .
tr	3	In the arm , the chest , until my fist hurt .
tr	3	" Fine , you want the truth now ? "
tr	2	Too stunned to form thoughts , never mind words .
tr	1	And I didn 't even care about any romantic feelings .
tr	3	But that was better than through the living room .
tr	2	Maybe she had good reasons for not being around .
tr	1	What did Jolie or Malcolm think we were hiding ?
tr	0	he said with a grunt and wrapped his arms around me .
tr	0	I scrambled away and flicked on the light .
tr	0	" Savvy , what are you doing ? "
tr	4	He sighed and waited almost a minute before speaking .
tr	3	I pulled about fifty threads out of the pillow .
tr	2	" Dad ... " I didn 't know what to say .
tr	2	" I know how to communicate with your mother .
tr	3	Not without telling him about my recent spy missions .
tr	3	And then just like that , he turned and left .
tr	4	His whole body seemed to lighten and the wrinkles smoothed out .
tr	3	But I 'll still try and communicate with your mom . "
tr	0	What did I ever have against spying anyway ?
tr	3	I grit my teeth to pull out another ten sit-ups .
tr	2	I dug down for the book on breaking codes .
tr	0	She 'd laugh and say , " About time . "
tr	0	We 'd chat and joke about Spy Games .
tr	0	And that was only a couple of weeks ago .
tr	3	I contemplated how he might react to my surprise visit .
tr	2	But not the cold-hearted , sneaky kind who worked for profit .
tr	2	For some reason , I couldn 't make myself walk forward .
tr	3	But that was when I didn 't care .
tr	3	They did make my butt look a little big .
tr	0	They 'd probably take one look at me and laugh .
tr	0	I watched as Nancy chatted gaily with Malcolm .
tr	2	Why didn 't I memorize some cool spy lingo ?
tr	2	His eyes widened and traveled up and down my body .
tr	1	I glared at him , trying to hide my reaction .
tr	2	It looked like something from a Tim Burton movie .
tr	3	I changed hands and kept trying to force it to work .
tr	2	Rough hands gripped my arm and whipped me around .
tr	1	Okay , not quite the way I 'd envisioned this happening .
tr	2	" Don 't hold back , " I shot out .
tr	0	No way would Dad work with a homicidal pastry chef .
tr	1	Quite ironic , don 't you think ? "
tr	4	The knowing smile on Jolie 's face reflected the truth .
tr	2	" I know a lot , " I shouted .
tr	2	" I am not some sort of joke .
tr	0	He will bring you nothing but heartache . "
tr	1	He made the motion like he was zipping his lips .
tr	2	" How do you know about that ? "
tr	3	I 'm not at liberty to say . "
tr	0	And you can forget all about me . "
tr	2	" I know nothing of your mother . "
tr	4	I reached into my large purse and grabbed my taser .
tr	1	With one quick thrust I aimed for his big belly .
tr	1	But he wasn 't as stupid as he looked .
tr	0	He caught my wrist inches from his belly .
tr	1	His grip tightened on my arm until I groaned in pain .
tr	3	" You want to play with the big boys ?
tr	4	Then I will treat you like one . "
tr	2	I hit the floor with no chance of blocking my fall .
tr	1	But he 'd be back with his minions .
tr	1	I turned the knob and stared down into the never-ending darkness .
tr	0	I came to a halt and stared in shock .
tr	1	A man sat slumped over in the chair , snoring gently .
tr	4	Or did they have her tied up in a separate cavern .
tr	2	" You don 't know me , sir . "
tr	1	I 've been waiting , staying alive , for you . "
tr	2	" Come on , let 's go . "
tr	0	He pulled away and spoke in English again .
tr	2	" Now I know you 've got the wrong girl .
tr	3	" At first I thought it wasn 't important either .
tr	4	All that was left were the charred bones of the dead .
tr	1	A voice rang through the cavern , sounding like a gunshot .
tr	2	The photo on Malcolm 's laptop flashed back to me .
tr	2	You both have run out of time ! "
tr	3	The butler went on , but I blocked him out .
tr	1	I gripped his shirt , not letting him go .
tr	3	The butler was curled into a fetal position .
tr	1	" Is , is he doing to die ? "
tr	1	Spying on someone was one thing , but killing a man ?
tr	0	Finally , I ran out of words and grabbed his hand .
tr	2	" Jolie thought I knew about your family .
tr	3	You must -- " A high-pitched scream interrupted his story .
tr	0	Her frizzy blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail .
tr	4	It felt like years had passed since I 'd seen her .
tr	3	But I think he 's lost it . "
tr	2	Go after my dad and mom too . "
tr	2	Her arms wrapped around my middle and she pushed .
tr	2	I stood to my feet , ready for round two .
tr	2	" Do you know where my mom is ?
tr	1	Did your crazy grandfather lock her up too ? "
tr	2	" I do not expect you to care for my grandfather .
tr	0	" Months ago , my grandfather started acting jumpy and nervous .
tr	4	The prisoner squeezed her hand and reached for mine .
tr	3	" My grandfather thought your mom had something to with it .
tr	2	But then she disappeared , and you and your dad arrived .
tr	2	" So why leave without saying goodbye ? "
tr	2	Mom used to go on a lot of trips .
tr	1	" It was always about my mom , " I murmured .
tr	3	" I must get you to help . "
tr	0	I put my hand behind him to help her .
tr	2	" There is nothing I can do to help you .
tr	0	But I cannot do that and save my grandfather . "
tr	3	Maybe today at the finals , they 'd finish the job .
tr	3	My leg shot out and caught the butler in the face .
tr	2	For not letting you know somehow that I was okay .
tr	3	For not telling you the truth from the start .
tr	0	At the front door , I paused , scanning the Extravaganza .
tr	2	I slipped out the door and joined the flow .
tr	1	He was supposed to be working for Spy Games .
tr	4	The news Jolie had been spotted rippled through the teams .
tr	2	Too bad he was too annoyed to speak in English .
tr	2	I absolutely could not let Malcolm see me .
tr	0	About ten yards away , I peeked around a strawberry tart .
tr	0	I pushed through the crowds a bit further .
tr	0	The colors and sounds of the Extravaganza swirled around me .
tr	0	And what girl would they be taking care of ?
tr	3	He pointed to the mountain of pastries on my tray .
tr	0	I won first place and advanced to the finals .
tr	4	It could 've been a rated R violent movie scene .
tr	2	" I 'm proud of you , Savvy . "
tr	1	" I 'm not saying you did everything right .
tr	2	Dad didn 't know the half of it .
tr	2	With one word , Jolie commanded my attention .
tr	3	" It is too late for that . "
tr	0	A man with curly hair pushed through the wall of people .
tr	4	Jolie moved his killer glare to the reporter .
tr	3	Like someone might try to plant a bullet in his chest .
tr	2	" You do not know what you are talking about . "
tr	4	I stepped closer to him and lowered my voice .
tr	2	As Jolie laughed hysterically , Malcolm and the mime closed in .
tr	3	Don 't you dare try to deny it . "
tr	1	" Like you had a chance of winning ?
tr	0	" My daughter can bake a mean birthday cake .
tr	2	" Way to go , Dad , " I whispered .
tr	4	But I had to make him believe me .
tr	2	Jolie 's goons ripped Dad away from me .
tr	0	He fought against the men holding his arms .
tr	3	Right as he turned , I threw it .
tr	4	Jolie spluttered and gasped , wiping frosting from his eyes .
tr	1	I 'd lost sight of Malcolm and the mime .
tr	2	With a small sob , I let go .
tr	1	I couldn 't tell if I was screaming or not .
tr	2	I needed to get away , find my dad .
tr	0	The face was fuzzy but I saw Dad 's dark hair .
tr	1	Through the pain , my mind locked in on his voice .
tr	2	I shook it off and took a deep breath .
tr	0	I 'd crawl away if I had to .
tr	3	The floodgates opened and I beat against him with my fists .
tr	1	" I was going to shoot him , " I whispered .
tr	1	Peyton grinned a normal , nice , warming smile .
tr	0	I pushed back and tried to squirm away .
tr	1	Malcolm gripped my arms so I couldn 't move .
tr	3	He 's much better at this than me . "
tr	1	" Guess you want some answers , huh ? "
tr	2	The knife still lay at Malcolm 's side .
tr	4	My words grated and tension throbbed between us .
tr	2	" When did your mom first contact you ? "
tr	0	" I know all about your family , " he said .
tr	2	" You don 't want to know . "
tr	0	" This might help with the pain . "
tr	3	My heart completed a set of short , staccato beats .
tr	4	He opened the flask and handed it to me .
tr	2	" Do you know anything about your mom 's work ? "
tr	2	" What do you know about my mom ? "
tr	2	" I don 't know where to find my mom .
tr	2	" Are you sure you want to know ? "
tr	1	We fell silent as I soaked in his words .
tr	0	I stifled a tiny groan of pain and pleasure .
tr	0	His past , my past , our families all faded .
tr	1	My hands roamed across his chest , exploring .
tr	2	Emotion flooded out and filled every inch of my body .
tr	3	At that moment , I didn 't care .
tr	4	You 've made me question everything in my life .
tr	3	" Not if you want to stay alive . "
tr	3	" I can 't let you get hurt .
tr	2	The high school scenario of two teens fooling around dissolved .
tr	2	Shouldn 't you bring me to a hospital or something ? "
tr	2	" I 'm sure someone will find you soon . "
tr	1	" I 'll be disappointed if you don 't . "
tr	3	The words barely made it past the lump in my throat .
tr	0	Walk away from all this and forget about me .
tr	1	It wasn 't one I could explain in one sentence .
tr	4	They didn 't seem to care I couldn 't breathe .
tr	1	I didn 't think it was a free ride home .
tr	3	I must be pretty important to have an escort .
tr	2	The second cop took off his hat and turned toward me .
tr	1	" You 're lucky I found you . "
tr	1	... to be continued in Heart of an Assassin .
tr	2	Would you like to know when my next book is available ?
tr	2	Did you know this book is part of a series ?
tr	4	Maybe we used one too many blasters . "
tr	3	I didn 't want to end up like that .
tr	3	" That 's the truth , sir . "
tr	4	He raised an eyebrow and his face softened .
tr	3	You can see that , right , sir ? "
tr	4	Dad finally spoke when we were in the driveway .
tr	0	That was all that was said for weeks .
tr	3	" Maybe we 'll have to resort to that . "
tr	2	" We 're going to have to think of something .
tr	1	We don 't need any damned bears wandering into camp . "
tr	3	Scott straightened slowly and the bear stopped growling .
tr	3	" Get into a fight with a bear ? "
tr	0	" That 's damned strange actions for a bear .
tr	0	" Was the bear coming at you ? "
tr	4	It seemed to be guarding that piece of red nylon . "
tr	3	" I clamped these lids on tight last night .
tr	3	He watched it closely until it stopped at the trash barrels .
tr	3	Scott watched the bear dig into the drum again .
tr	3	" You might be on to something there little brother .
tr	1	It also might explain how your rifle got hit . "
tr	2	The younger Lyndon looked off into the underbrush .
tr	2	" It comes down here foraging for food .
tr	3	The tray was there but there was something on the tray .
tr	0	Why had he thought the child would return ?
tr	2	How old do you think she is ? "
tr	3	" But she was talking to that bear .
tr	0	" And that would mean catching her . "
tr	2	" Closer so we can do what ? "
tr	2	" I have to run into town for supplies .
tr	2	" I forgot to put out her food . "
tr	3	" It 's only a little after ten .
tr	4	I 'm sure you have plenty of time yet . "
tr	2	" Bringing your breakfast to the office now ? "
tr	3	" I found that on the tray this morning .
tr	0	I added a banana to her supper last night . "
tr	0	" She knows how to peel a banana ? "
tr	3	I think I took a step toward that last night . "
tr	0	he asked his brother through barely moving lips .
tr	3	Scott frowned in thought then took a chance .
tr	1	" If I knew that I wouldn 't be guessing . "
tr	1	She sat down beside it and began stroking its fur .
tr	3	" I think this coyote 's another protector . "
tr	3	Scott looked from the bear to the little girl and back .
tr	3	" Why don 't you put this in the truck . "
tr	0	Other than a whimpering whine Scott heard nothing from the animal .
tr	2	He smiled and wondered if she would understand .
tr	3	" You 've thought that for years . "
tr	2	" It 's ok , " he said gently and nodded .
tr	3	Instantly the bear lumbered toward them at a trot .
tr	3	Scott smiled at the little girl 's questioning eyes .
tr	3	It dropped to its haunches and sat there watching them .
tr	3	Scott turned his attention to the little girl and smiled .
tr	4	He said a prayer for her then went back inside .
tr	3	Chapter 5 " Site two to base . "
tr	4	" Scott , we got us a problem up here . "
tr	1	He says it 's caught on something . "
tr	3	" That 's the first thing we thought of .
tr	1	Scott Lyndon scowled and examined the situation again .
tr	4	" You guys stay here , " he instructed .
tr	4	The man in the midst of the logs asked in disbelief .
tr	0	" That 's why I had to laugh . "
tr	4	" Seems he 'd have more connections than you would . "
tr	1	It 'd kill her to be in captivity . "
tr	4	He spotted the empty tray long before he reached it .
tr	4	He decided to try the same approach they had both used .
tr	1	To his surprise , she laid her tiny hand in his .
tr	4	" Hello , " she said in the same angelic voice .
tr	3	The animal seemed totally content with what was going on .
tr	1	A soft howling cry erupted from her throat .
tr	2	" Where 's your Mommy and Daddy ? "
tr	4	There was nothing up there but steep mountains and deep gorges .
tr	3	Scott hurried in and tossed the tray on the counter .
tr	3	" You 'd better take a two way . "
tr	2	The frown disappeared and she smiled and nodded .
tr	2	He was not one for wild goose chases .
tr	4	Less than a mile farther , she found it .
tr	4	He looked at the little girl to see her watching him .
tr	4	This little girl had been in these mountains for five years ?
tr	2	" Do you sleep all winter too ? "
tr	2	Certainly the coyote could not bring her food .
tr	2	" How do you get down to see them ? "
tr	4	Or , to be more precise , Sidney would be .
tr	3	Scott thought the animal looked a lot like a point man .
tr	0	" Can I look in your Daddy 's backpack ? "
tr	1	" Daddy is sleeping so it 's ok . "
tr	1	No identification and there was nothing else in the main compartment .
tr	0	They also had a four year old expiration date .
tr	0	The backpack had cost $ 20 and was bought at Sears .
tr	2	" Sidney , does Daddy carry a wallet ? "
tr	2	" I don 't see your Daddy 's wallet . "
tr	2	" Can I look in Mommy 's backpack too ? "
tr	2	Two bodies , two sets of bones , and no identities .
tr	2	Did Mommy and Daddy drive a car ? "
tr	0	" A big red and white car . "
tr	0	That would have generated a report and an investigation .
tr	2	" How old was your brother when he went away ? "
tr	2	Sidney looked down at the bones then smiled and nodded .
tr	2	" Shall we go and let Mommy and Daddy sleep ? "
tr	4	Was there family who had been searching for them ?
tr	2	" You coming back to camp now ? "
tr	2	Should be home in thirty minutes or so . "
tr	2	" What do you plan on doing ? "
tr	3	" Report that I found those two skeletons . "
tr	2	" What are you going to do about Sidney ? "
tr	1	" How 's it goin ' Sheriff ? "
tr	4	Steve called after a quick glance at his brother .
tr	4	" We just picked up a passenger , " he commented .
tr	3	" This is going to take some getting used to . "
tr	3	Scott looked at the girl with a smile .
tr	3	She had had a lot more contact with Scott .
tr	3	Scott took the wallet and noticed it was well worn .
tr	4	He took a deep breath and opened it .
tr	4	" Sammie , " he decided then flipped the leaf over .
tr	1	He examined it but found no markings on it .
tr	4	Please contact me if I can be of further assistance .
tr	1	Could it be the family was moving to California ?
tr	0	It was a small cabin that Susan and I built ourselves .
tr	2	Our daughter Sidney , does not know of our plans .
tr	4	" Can you keep it safe with Mommy 's locket ? "
tr	3	Scott Lyndon had to blink back the tears .
tr	4	The smile she gave him alighted her blue eyes .
tr	0	" I saw Sid cross the yard at a full gallop .
tr	0	Actually , the number of animals had grown .
tr	4	Sidney had taken them in and raised them .
tr	4	But you know how these new people are .
tr	1	" We will Josh , " Scott assured .
tr	1	Big city boys got big city ideas . "
tr	2	" You know I 'm just waitin ' for you . "
tr	4	The uniformed man looked after her then shook his head .
tr	3	" That 'd put it on our land . "
tr	2	" The guy might be trigger happy . "
tr	3	Scott could now hear the truck and told his sister so .
tr	1	Too many people and not enough hunting ground .
tr	2	" Did you get a good look at the truck ? "
tr	1	Scott asked , knowing her keen night vision .
tr	0	The passenger was older and had gray hair .
tr	1	The driver was younger with dark hair . "
tr	1	" We 'll call the sheriff first thing in the morning .
tr	2	" I had some checking to do . "
tr	4	" You 're the best brother I could have . "
tr	3	" I gather that 's the calling card he left . "
tr	3	He was not sure he wanted to know the truth .
tr	2	" What window 'd he shoot out ? "
tr	2	He closed his notebook and tucked it back into his pocket .
tr	2	" Do you want to file a complaint ? "
tr	4	I can take care of the grey and everything else . "
tr	4	Scott knew the ' everything else ' was the pups .
tr	2	" But could you do me a favor ? "
tr	4	They were good people and they didn 't rile easily .
tr	3	Scott thought him to be in his mid-twenties .
tr	0	" What can I do for ya ' ? "
tr	2	" I 'm looking for either Scott or Sidney Lyndon .
tr	3	" I 'm Scott Lyndon , " he told the man .
tr	0	Never had he thought he would be facing this !
tr	4	He swallowed again and pressed himself tightly into the corner .
tr	1	Dan Jansen felt his heart pound in his chest .
tr	3	" But it wasn 't enough , was it ?
tr	2	" You are very good with animals Miss Lyndon . "
tr	2	Two of the occupants of the porch recognized the voice .
tr	2	You do know the meaning of the word , correct ? "
tr	1	" I think Tip 's done eating . "
tr	3	Scott Lyndon looked at the distant form of his sister .
tr	3	" She 's actually taking it pretty slow tonight . "
tr	2	Country life is just too slow for me . "
tr	1	I don 't think I could live without her . "
tr	3	" Does she actually talk to them ? "
tr	2	The End This book is a work of fiction .
tr	0	Although based on years of factual research , it is fiction .
tr	2	You could almost hear his heart pounding out of his chest .
tr	1	Occasionally , an upside-down glimpse of his face came into view .
tr	1	" Not ... gon na ... make ... it ! "
tr	2	" I know I winged you , too .
tr	0	It was a warm morning , but a damp one .
tr	0	Alex loved swimming and was good at it .
tr	0	Alex 's dad was Richard ( Rick ) Williamson .
tr	2	How do you always know what I want ? "
tr	2	You practice almost five hours a day counting the gym work .
tr	0	Have fun , don 't work all day .
tr	2	" Is that not good enough for you ?
tr	4	Rick yelled through the door as he banged on it .
tr	0	Rick was always leery of barging into Anna 's room .
tr	3	When are you going to start setting the alarm clock ? "
tr	3	I think you can start getting yourself up soon . "
tr	1	" Breakfast will be waiting , your highness . "
tr	2	" How many eggs do each of you want ? "
tr	3	It took twenty minutes to walk to school .
tr	4	This precise routine was followed every day , to the second .
tr	0	" I have a clock in my head .
tr	4	Alex asked expectantly , seeming oblivious to her own accomplishment .
tr	2	Do I ever let up on you in the pool ? "
tr	2	You goin ' to practice after school ? "
tr	0	" Yeah , right , " said Alex skeptically .
tr	1	Many kids could be heard murmuring about the rumored pop quiz .
tr	1	I like where you 're going with this ! "
tr	2	What did the normal moms and dads do ?
tr	2	All we know is what the royalty wore . "
tr	2	Others joined in , " What was school like ? "
tr	0	Kaylie loved to practice as much as playing .
tr	2	" OK , we 'll play one half .
tr	1	Shouldn 't I be in the long jump ? "
tr	0	Anna stared blankly , considering all he had said .
tr	3	That 's more points for the team , isn 't it ?
tr	4	She smirked and backed up about ten feet .
tr	0	" That was actually 4 ' l0 " .
tr	1	Just put your hands up to catch your fall .
tr	4	She then noticed something else , something rattling inside .
tr	1	Jodie and Alex continued to train on their own .
tr	0	" Best idea you 've had all day ! "
tr	0	" More like balsa wood , " Alex said .
tr	4	It soon emerged spotless and Alex held it out to examine .
tr	2	" How could it be so perfectly smooth ? "
tr	4	Alex yelled over her shoulder as they pedaled off .
tr	2	Call me later or something , will you ?
tr	0	Ironically he was commanding his army against the Roman Empire .
tr	0	" Caesar raided your lands , too ? "
tr	0	I do recall peasants and field workers , at least .
tr	0	" OK , what about the servants and peasants ? "
tr	1	" I didn 't know you put ham in it . "
tr	1	Kaylie finished putting the broccoli in the pot .
tr	3	" Do I put this other stuff in here ? "
tr	0	Kids have always found ways to make balls .
tr	2	" Oh , cool , I need that ! "
tr	0	" Did you find your answer yet , Kay ? "
tr	0	" What 's this -- uh -- holy -- !
tr	0	They all agreed , sat down , and started passing food .
tr	2	" No , not all of them , " Rick corrected .
tr	2	Christy intoned , following up with spooky noises .
tr	3	" Don 't be stupid , " Christy snorted .
tr	1	" Girls , I 'm going to call my friend .
tr	2	It would have to be for five , though .
tr	0	" Would you happen to be reading about Mayan artifacts ? "
tr	1	What 's going on ; you must really miss me ! "
tr	2	" Wow , she looks pretty today ! "
tr	4	" We were hoping you might help us figure that out .
tr	2	" No , more like ... popcorn ! "
tr	3	But it is written about by countless ' observers . '
tr	2	The girls all snickered and poked at him playfully .
tr	4	" OK , so we 're stupid and wasted your time .
tr	3	" They 're just flirting , " Anna told her .
tr	3	He tells us to stay away from them ! "
tr	1	Abby smiled , " I didn 't think so .
tr	4	Jessica looked up at him , reverently , " Dad ?
tr	0	All I could make out was a few Mayan numbers . "
tr	2	" Exactly , it looks kind of like Braille .
tr	1	" I don 't get it , " Rick said .
tr	3	" I just translate , you historians and archeologists interpret !
tr	0	" Thanks , Walt , " Abby said .
tr	1	" Did I find something like ... important ? "
tr	3	Kaylie stuck her tongue out at Alex this time .
tr	2	" Too bad he 's got the hots for Abby ! "
tr	3	What if those texts were just slightly misunderstood ? "
tr	4	How else could anyone explain some of the descriptions ?
tr	4	These Mayans could have gone back in time .
tr	3	That it came from Anna 's big butt ? "
tr	1	" Future aliens visiting the past , " Jessica concluded comically .
tr	3	I can try to find someone who studies the myth . "
tr	2	" Abby , what do you know of the myths ? "
tr	2	Those could be up to 64 million years . "
tr	1	" I didn 't say I could solve everything !
tr	0	Abby waved , blew a kiss and signed off .
tr	4	" Oh , " Christy seemed to understand .
tr	1	" Hurry up , go get ready , girls ! "
tr	1	Satisfied it was not dangerous , he passed it around .
tr	1	This is all a bit difficult to comprehend ! "
tr	4	Twelve eyes stared at her like puppy dogs at a whistle .
tr	0	A menu appeared with options of record and playback .
tr	4	These things are made to keep records of time travel .
tr	2	Anna was still totally baffled by the whole thing .
tr	0	" What do you mean about algebra ? "
tr	3	" What 's the matter , Rob , intimidated ? "
tr	2	" You know I 'll find a way , Rob .
tr	4	Rob loved a challenge and intrigue doubled the fun .
tr	1	Now I won 't sleep tonight until I find it .
tr	2	" What do you think , Daddy ? "
tr	1	At first , the Chronicler was in view .
tr	0	I should have checked but wasn 't thinking .
tr	3	Taylor then darted off the path and through the woods .
tr	2	" I know you 're out there , Taylor !
tr	1	Jessica asked with a sad expression , full of empathy .
tr	4	" I trust my coin is well preserved ? "
tr	3	" That , my friend , is the forgotten trail .
tr	3	I wasn 't sure if you wanted that or not . "
tr	2	I know someone who would probably jump right on it . "
tr	2	He shook Anna awake and told her to go to bed .
tr	2	What would you desire on your plate this morning ? "
tr	2	" OK , why are you doing this today ? "
tr	1	" I 'm not going in no cave . "
tr	3	That 's why we can 't go this morning .
tr	0	Anna shot a very menacing look her way .
tr	3	It 's not worth a lot ... " " Exactly !
tr	1	It 's really an endowment , you know .
tr	2	It 's over two billion dollars now . "
tr	2	You know how much interest there is on two billion dollars ?
tr	3	No , there must not be anything but weeds around it .
tr	1	Worthless hunk of land , it is . "
tr	2	" Johnson , I thank you so much for your time .
tr	4	" Yeah ... Yeah , definitely , " he replied distractedly .
tr	0	Can I stay in the van and play with it ? "
tr	2	Nobody opens a door or even a window without me watching .
tr	3	Is that why you wanted to stay ? "
tr	2	What would you girls like from the concession stand ? "
tr	3	There are still things that are dangerous to watch .
tr	2	You want some of my drink and hot dog ? "
tr	3	" A little -- a bite or two .
tr	2	" How do you do them both then ? "
tr	0	Abby said with a sly smile on her face .
tr	4	" I want to see something from the Roman Empire .
tr	3	" Looks that way , but why ? "
tr	4	" And you 're sure nobody will detect it ? "
tr	3	" We got ta tell Dad about this ! "
tr	2	You seem to like to worry , I don 't .
tr	4	Personally , I think they 're extremely mature .
tr	2	I don 't think you need to worry . "
tr	1	" Says Ms. Oblivious ... " " Shush . "
tr	3	You don 't give them enough credit for their maturity . "
tr	3	That 's what I 'm worried about , girls !
tr	4	" The dinosaurs and cavemen were really the coolest though .
tr	2	You won 't let any of us ? "
tr	3	" Then you best be studying fast ! "
tr	1	" Don 't you mean Uncle Ricky ? "
tr	0	" Dad , " she said again , defiantly .
tr	0	" Why can 't I just go by myself ?
tr	4	" Because I 'm responsible for you . "
tr	4	He feigned shock and realization , " Wow !
tr	0	" I care , that 's all . "
tr	3	They stood to watch the last two events end .
tr	0	Kay has two goals , " Christy cheerfully announced .
tr	1	" Kay scored another goal , her third .
tr	4	Alex updated them as they reclaimed their spots on the blanket .
tr	0	" She 's not that bad , " Anna offered .
tr	3	" That 's because you stink , too ! "
tr	1	I 'm going to pet a dinosaur , first thing ! "
tr	3	" I 'm going to the future ! "
tr	0	" I 'm with Anna , the past already happened !
tr	2	" Oh no , not you too ? "
tr	3	" Hmmm ... Never thought of it that way . "
tr	4	Abby rubbed some insect repellent on everyone 's exposed skin .
tr	0	" What if we run into a bear ? "
tr	0	Kaylie asked , half curious , half worried .
tr	0	They looked at him as if he had sprouted horns .
tr	1	" Stop , " Abby instructed as she consulted the GPS .
tr	4	Everyone is responsible for watching the person in front of them .
tr	3	We must all stay together no matter what . "
tr	0	They shared their thoughts with a knowing glance .
tr	2	Looks like 250 feet or so to the next fork . "
tr	0	They all came back with sad , disappointed faces .
tr	2	I don 't see one , do you ? "
tr	0	She put her hands on her hips and awaited an answer .
tr	3	" It was fun though , wasn 't it ?
tr	2	Come on -- move your lazy butt ! "
tr	0	Anna simply glared at him , " Fine ! "
tr	0	Rick shook Kaylie and Alex , whose eyes had shut again .
tr	2	She couldn 't know -- or could she ?
tr	3	" Thanks , I just got it last weekend .
tr	2	Alex says it makes my boobs look big though . "
tr	3	I thought you went to get a drink . "
tr	3	" Don 't look at me that way .
tr	3	It was taken point-blank , straight at the wall in question .
tr	0	Now Abby could clearly see what had grabbed his attention .
tr	1	" I think I can stay up a while myself .
tr	3	" Isn 't it OK to dream though ? "
tr	4	" Maybe you 're not excited enough , " she retorted .
tr	4	Could we have both evolved from the same species ?
tr	1	Which leads to ... how did life begin ?
tr	1	Kaylie whispered , still smiling that happy , fun smile .
tr	2	" Do you want her to be ? "
tr	1	She loves us as much as she does you !
tr	2	She looked so happy and comfortable playing mommy today .
tr	4	Why don 't we wake Alex and go to bed ?
tr	4	He closed her door and went to the garage .
tr	2	Did you actually look on the couch ? "
tr	2	" Uh , no , I got on the computer . "
tr	0	" She hit me with a shoe ! "
tr	0	Anna smacked her on the back of the head again .
tr	3	" Well , my butt is not fat ! "
tr	4	" So , when are we going ? "
tr	1	Kaylie asked as soon as she was in sight .
tr	3	I can 't wait to see that time machine ! "
tr	1	" I 'm not hungry , " Anna told him defiantly .
tr	4	" You need to learn to be patient and behave ! "
tr	0	" You like having a place to put your earrings ? "
tr	3	The swirl pattern matched perfectly with that in the inset area .
tr	2	" No , I mean what do we do now ? "
tr	0	She was at the far end of the pathway .
tr	0	" That 's what I was gon na show you ! "
tr	4	Jessica protested , wanting credit for the discovery she had made .
tr	0	" Uh , where does it go , though ? "
tr	2	" What do you think you 're doing , Kay ? "
tr	3	He stopped at the first support beam and studied it .
tr	0	" This size , " he held up his flashlight .
tr	0	How dare you scare us all like that ! "
tr	0	Abby fumed at Kaylie , " What is this ?
tr	3	" So he 's putting you up to this ? "
tr	1	Abby chastised herself , " Gosh , you 're so right .
tr	2	No wonder you and Rick are such good friends , Kaylie .
tr	2	Nobody spoke , anticipating the details of his photography session .
tr	4	The other girls hurriedly shucked their clothes as well .
tr	4	Several excited nods later , they were darting about the room .
tr	0	" You mean a place to travel ? "
tr	0	" No , a date , Rick . "
tr	1	Christy stepped forward , " I 'm Christy .
tr	2	Abby spoke first , " I 'm Abby . "
tr	0	I don 't want to make any fatal errors . "
tr	0	If you prefer a general area , you can say that .
tr	2	" You can normally select a location manually , as well .
tr	4	He noticed it would zoom faster if he pushed in further .
tr	1	We can look inside of things , even through things ? "
tr	0	Rick was taken aback , " Why ? "
tr	4	" Those memories have been removed , Rick . "
tr	3	" What can you tell me about it , T ? "
tr	2	need ... to learn more about your memory technology ? "
tr	3	And thanks for transferring the poem , to the UC . "
tr	1	" Did I just hear a hint of cynicism ?
tr	4	The arm retracted and disappeared into the console .
tr	2	" Very wise of you to notice , Rick .
tr	0	" Oh , you think this ... boy has it ? "
tr	1	Caesar is still alive at this time , right ?
tr	3	" Can you get us something to eat ? "
tr	1	" Would you like fries with that , Rick ? "
tr	2	Alex now has permission to control the console . "
tr	1	It was four feet high , six wide .
tr	4	" Is this volume level acceptable , Rick ? "
tr	1	We cannot discuss any of this with anyone .
tr	0	" That guy looks gay , " Anna concluded .
tr	0	" Pause , T , " Alex said wearily .
tr	2	" OK , I should probably go alone .
tr	3	Sure enough , it only went just past her waist .
tr	0	Alex said , changing her mind yet again .
tr	1	" You and I are going treasure hunting .
tr	3	Nice to be a part of it ! "
tr	2	she said playfully , knowing his habit well .
tr	4	" Why are you suddenly so eager now ?
tr	3	" It 's not that bad , we 're just looking .
tr	4	" Crude , but effective , " Kaylie concurred .
tr	0	A tug at his shirt accompanied the address .
tr	4	" How do we talk to these people ?
tr	0	How far ahead are we going in ? "
tr	1	Anna stopped , considering her plans for a moment .
tr	2	That should allow us to get close enough to Octavian .
tr	2	" Do you wish to disable safety protocols , Rick ? "
tr	1	" Destination confirmed safe , initiating displacement , " T answered .
tr	1	" They just vanished , no fancy lights , no countdown ?
tr	1	T had mentioned a slight , brief orientation period upon arrival .
tr	0	He plans to ambush us and take our lands ! "
tr	4	He hides because , well , because he 's embarrassed .
tr	3	" But ... they belong to our father !
tr	0	" Our father died two years ago in a battle .
tr	2	Alex was floored with compassion for the story .
tr	3	Titus came out just then carrying a studded leather tunic .
tr	1	" You sure are in a hurry ! "
tr	2	" There , does it look good on me ? "
tr	2	" You look good , Rick , " Christy blurted .
tr	1	I understand you would like to guide us through Rome ? "
tr	3	She started to answer , but couldn 't .
tr	0	What a beautiful name for a beautiful girl !
tr	2	Are you going to be OK now ? "
tr	2	We should be on our way , shouldn 't we ?
tr	1	I understand you 're in a hurry for some reason ? "
tr	4	She then turned and blended into the crowd .
tr	2	" Why do you need to carry someone ? "
tr	1	This made Rick laugh uncontrollably when Christy explained it to him .
tr	3	The soon-to-be emperor finally turned and started to walk toward them .
tr	3	" Just the important details , OK ? "
tr	0	A woman was screaming , " Thief ! "
tr	4	demanded the larger of the two guards on the scene .
tr	3	This woman tried to steal from me ! "
tr	3	This startled both the guards and the woman .
tr	1	Rick scolded , his voice filled with authority .
tr	1	I got scared and tried to run away from her ! "
tr	4	It was blue , but roughly the same size and shape .
tr	1	Rick stopped and turned , getting down on one knee .
tr	2	You should have come to me when you spotted it . "
tr	2	He was loading another bolt into his crossbow .
tr	0	Grab that arrow and yank it out ! "
tr	0	Alex was hysterical , " I can 't !
tr	2	You 're not supposed to do that anyway , Dad ! "
tr	2	" But so could you , Daddy ! "
tr	2	Now just quit complaining and do what you 're told ! "
tr	2	" Do you think you can make it ? "
tr	1	All those thoughts assailed his mind at once .
tr	2	A trio of protesting howls came from the girls .
tr	0	Kaylie went once again and bought a blanket from a merchant .
tr	0	She had found the two girls hiding behind piles of trash .
tr	0	It was nearing dark when they finally reached the last alleyway .
tr	1	The girls rested while Rick crept forward to look around .
tr	3	" No , I can 't tell who 's out there .
tr	4	" Perhaps you weren 't punished enough then ! "
tr	4	Her eyes widened , " I can 't take that !
tr	1	It 's worth more than our entire farm ! "
tr	2	Rick shook his head , " Probably not .
tr	3	" This will just take a minute ! "
tr	1	Do you think it will survive a washing ? "
tr	3	But right now , we got ta go .
tr	4	Jessica fretted after only fifteen seconds had passed .
tr	2	I 'm not losing you now , mister ! "
tr	2	Kaylie proudly unfolded it and dangled it in front of her .
tr	0	Is that an actual basket made by Roman hands ?
tr	4	" I have another message now , " she informed him .
tr	3	She zoomed in further and told T to rotate the image .
tr	0	Rick held up a hand to stop her .
tr	2	" So you 're not mad at me ? "
tr	2	" No , I 'll help you , " she said .
tr	3	Let 's figure out what to do next now .
tr	2	We are doing nothing tonight but go home .
tr	1	Then we 're discussing Salem , Massachusetts . "
tr	1	" So , what 's in Massachusetts ? "
tr	2	You got any books of that time ? "
tr	2	It sounds good , doesn 't it ? "
tr	2	" Wow , how much power does that produce ? "
tr	3	The girls and Abby took turns supporting him .
tr	2	You have to get Jess and Anna up tomorrow , too .
tr	2	But , " he looked up at her in confusion .
tr	3	" So ... did you get the crystal ? "
tr	0	" Are you gon na beat us ? "
tr	3	" That wouldn 't be fair , would it ? "
tr	0	" Go put away your things and get back here .
tr	3	" He made a mistake this time , " Scott said .
tr	1	" Are you suggesting this one 's a setup as well ?
tr	1	It 's a man -- I know it . "
tr	2	" How did he become so popular ? "
tr	2	" Well , Samantha , it 's really quite simple .
tr	4	You are capable of independent thought -- even humor !
tr	0	That was really funny , Sam , " he said sarcastically .
tr	4	Red scales faded , turning tan like the desert .
tr	0	Now all Margaret cared about was her life .
tr	4	The boat sat in silence , undiscovered , for days .
tr	0	A great black spot lay in the desert ahead of him .
tr	2	Carlos nodded to his friends then took off for the wreckage .
tr	4	The bikers rolled cautiously down the slope toward the burnt wreckage .
tr	3	The thirty foot wide circle of ash smelled of burnt plastic .
tr	2	Josie crouched down , moving around the corpse .
tr	4	" What 's a speedboat doing out here ?
tr	4	Josie ignored her friends and stared at the burnt corpse .
tr	0	" Is that a hole in his chest ? "
tr	1	" I think this is a gun ! "
tr	2	She looked up as more drops began to fall .
tr	4	Josie nearly fell over as she jerked back .
tr	4	A couple of the guys were already starting their motorcycles .
tr	2	Josie gave the burnt stone body one more look .
tr	2	Josie finally shook her head and stood up .
tr	2	Water began to pool on the ground around the stone man .
tr	1	The stone man 's gaping wound begin to fill .
tr	1	The stone man was now just a shirtless , gaunt figure .
tr	2	Pooled water began to soak into the sand .
tr	3	Then it began to soak into the stone .
tr	1	The gray then faded , turning to tanned skin .
tr	0	Logan asked around a mouthful of energy bar .
tr	1	" That makes no sense , Josie , " Logan said .
tr	1	She 's trying to screw with us ! "
tr	4	Her steely gaze was tinged with a bit of fear .
tr	0	You had me going for a sec , " Kendall said .
tr	2	" Big day in the Canyons tomorrow , losers .
tr	2	Logan held up his hands and stood up .
tr	4	He wisely remained quiet and walked off to his own tent .
tr	2	Finally , he stood up and offered a hand to Josie .
tr	2	He leaned forward and put his hands down .
tr	4	They were loose and baggy - several sizes too large .
tr	0	He began to walk forward , toward the distant campfire .
tr	2	Not much - maybe only a few drops .
tr	4	He saw the many bottles inside the cooler .
tr	3	The cold water went down his throat quickly .
tr	1	Josie lay unmoving in her tent , listening .
tr	1	She had slept in her motocross pants and a large t-shirt .
tr	2	He wore black pants , and one boot .
tr	0	He had smooth skin - especially on his bald head .
tr	2	Not swollen from drinking too much liquid , but more muscular .
tr	3	It was the burnt , stone man from the boat wreck .
tr	2	Jimmy looked around , not knowing what to do .
tr	3	The stranger dropped his last empty water bottle on the ground .
tr	0	Logan wasn 't about to stand there slack-jawed .
tr	0	With his other hand he pushed against Logan 's chest .
tr	0	He looked at his arm , then his chest .
tr	1	From behind the stranger , Jimmy had sprung back up .
tr	4	The blade sank deep into the man 's back .
tr	1	His shots all hit the stranger 's bare chest .
tr	0	It wasn 't that Carlos was a chicken .
tr	1	He didn 't consider himself afraid of most anything .
tr	2	" And judging from these stars , you are too ? "
tr	0	The stranger 's hand was dry and smooth - and warm .
tr	1	" You 're in Arizona , " Josie said .
tr	0	" What 's your name , kid ? "
tr	4	She hadn 't realized all the guys had fled the area .
tr	3	" I don 't - " she started to say .
tr	1	Logan winced but didn 't cry out in pain .
tr	2	Mark twisted his head around and tried to look behind him .
tr	0	I thought you said your name was Mark ? "
tr	4	They were strangely shaped , with off-road tires .
tr	3	Mark pointed to the one of the trucks .
tr	1	Mark was surprised but kept his face straight .
tr	1	" Jimmy , that is ridiculous , " Josie declared .
tr	1	" Uh , it 's 2013 , " Jimmy said .
tr	2	head wound ... " " Found me ? "
tr	2	Josie looked down for a moment , embarrassed .
tr	4	" You were stone , " Josie tried to explain .
tr	0	" That doesn 't make any sense at all .
tr	1	Now he didn 't even recognize his own clothing .
tr	2	" Do you have any ID on you ?
tr	2	But like always , Jimmy reluctantly followed Josie 's lead .
tr	1	He pushed against the plastic , ripping it .
tr	2	" I 'll be damned , " he said aloud .
tr	1	It was a modern one-hundred , printed in 2011 .
tr	4	" What do you remember after the war ? "
tr	4	His boots were polished to a perfect shine .
tr	0	As always , she wore slacks , turtleneck and lab coat .
tr	0	Maria smiled at Mark as she brushed her hair .
tr	2	" Ready to go back to work ? "
tr	3	It still felt strange to wear a ring .
tr	4	She 'd remember her honeymoon vacation for a long time .
tr	3	" I tend to get what I want . "
tr	2	" Oh , is that how you got me ? "
tr	0	" I fig - " Maria started to say .
tr	4	A red phone that was never supposed to ring .
tr	1	I 'll inform Dr. Guerrero , " Mark finally said .
tr	0	Maria asked , standing up from her chair .
tr	4	" Mark , those are my people down there !
tr	2	" Protocol says we keep it locked in until nightfall .
tr	2	" I 'm so close to figuring out how it works !
tr	3	It was the fangs and teeth part that bothered him .
tr	0	Maria walked up to Mark and his gun closet .
tr	0	Only the hum of the lights could be heard .
tr	3	They were still trying to reach Command for authorization .
tr	2	Hidden hydraulics took over , slowly swinging the door outwards .
tr	2	The door swung to its half-open position and stopped .
tr	2	The basilisk suddenly darted out from behind the door .
tr	0	It hissed and turned to face Mark and Maria .
tr	2	Mark looked over at his wife , worry on his face .
tr	4	Maria nearly fell down in the elevator , but quickly recovered .
tr	4	Suddenly , she spied Mark , pinned under the flaming debris .
tr	2	Logan was hurt , and needed to go to a doctor .
tr	2	Kendall was only too willing to take him .
tr	4	And he wasn 't even sweating in the heat .
tr	4	Josie asked from the bed of the truck .
tr	0	Her hair was back in a long pony tail .
tr	3	" But it is starting to come back ? "
tr	2	You have any more of those nightgowns of yours ? "
tr	1	Carlos said , offering the shirt to Mark .
tr	3	Mark accepted the shirt and started to put it on .
tr	1	" Carlos is in love with her . "
tr	1	Jimmy finished closing up the tailgate of his truck .
tr	2	Mark turned to look off into the morning desert .
tr	3	" It 's that way , right ? "
tr	3	" I don 't trust him , " Jimmy pouted .
tr	0	She had a handful of friends and that was it .
tr	2	Logan eyed Mark suspiciously but took the money .
tr	1	Josie slid over , next to Jimmy , who was driving .
tr	0	His truck couldn 't navigate as well as his motorcycle had .
tr	0	It made Jimmy wish for a paved road .
tr	1	" Are you sure your friends will be all right ? "
tr	1	Jimmy immediately noticed Josie got out on Mark 's side .
tr	0	Almost as big as a softball , oblong .
tr	0	It was heavy , and hard , like a stone .
tr	3	Complete with the stubs of stone arteries sticking out from it .
tr	0	" That looks like a human heart , " Mark commented .
tr	2	Thank you , Mr. Obvious , Jimmy thought to himself .
tr	3	As it did so , the stone turned to flesh .
tr	3	" That 's not what I meant , " Jimmy said .
tr	2	" What 's wrong with you , Jimmy ? "
tr	3	Wasn 't that what she was trying to do now ?
tr	4	" Well , I do , " Josie replied .
tr	0	Brass casings , thicker than bananas - grenades ?
tr	2	" Do you realize how crazy you sound ?
tr	1	" Straps , belts , holsters , " Mark said .
tr	1	Jimmy was reaching the limits of his patience .
tr	2	Josie took a step forward , toward Mark .
tr	1	Jimmy asked , folding his arms across his chest .
tr	4	Josie walked up to Mark , her eyes pleading and sincere .
tr	1	Your memories are coming back , right ? "
tr	1	Jimmy didn 't like where this was going .
tr	3	This wasn 't a stray dog they were talking about .
tr	1	Jimmy had made it crystal clear he didn 't like him .
tr	0	Now Jimmy was offering him a place to stay .
tr	0	Josie stepped around beside Mark , facing back across at Jimmy .
tr	2	And you know I like a good mystery . "
tr	2	" I don 't know if that 's a good idea .
tr	3	" That I don 't remember , " Mark admitted .
tr	3	At first , they 'd been met with skepticism and laughter .
tr	2	The boys were quickly moved to an interrogation room .
tr	1	" We should have just kept our mouths shut . "
tr	2	He was interrupted by the door to the interrogation room opening .
tr	3	" Out in the desert ... " Carlos blurted out .
tr	4	" He 's alive , " the agent announced .
tr	3	Thomas was the only one to survive the Atlantic crossing .
tr	0	A couple of years later , he saw action in Korea .
tr	0	And that 's about where Mark decided to clam up .
tr	4	He could feel the pavement was hot , very hot .
tr	2	This was so out of character for him .
tr	3	Talking was better than staring at each other in silence .
tr	0	The public bought it - with the help of Hollywood .
tr	4	By the 1980s , superheroes were selling toys and lunch boxes .
tr	0	Mark looked at the foam rubber and plastic shoes with disdain .
tr	2	Dirty , ragged blue jeans and cowboy boots .
tr	1	They walked right up behind Josie with big grins .
tr	3	" You just get back from the war ? "
tr	0	She held her hand up , towards the locals .
tr	4	" You guys know where I can get some pancakes ? "
tr	2	Mark stood only a few steps short of the dirty duo .
tr	4	The impact doubled Cletus over and sent him hurling backwards .
tr	4	Campbell looked up from the tablet , surprised .
tr	0	He had no relatives as far as Campbell knew .
tr	4	Campbell hated it , but they were going to need help .
tr	4	We need to contain and assess , " Campbell ordered .
tr	2	It would be night in a couple of hours .
tr	4	" And you really do need some new clothes . "
tr	3	Mark sighed , and got out of the truck .
tr	3	It rolled to a stop behind Jimmy 's parked truck .
tr	2	" Standby , 532 , " the dispatcher advised .
tr	4	Lee waited patiently , eyeing the empty , parked truck .
tr	1	" Is this the fugitive vehicle or not , dispatch ? "
tr	3	" We 're to standby but make no contact . "
tr	3	Mark felt at the thin fabric of the shirt .
tr	4	Once more , Jimmy wanted to question what they were doing .
tr	1	" Helping this guy , " Jimmy explained .
tr	1	" I think he has anger issues , " Jimmy suggested .
tr	2	It was all he could come up with .
tr	4	Jimmy briefly considered telling Josie how he felt about her .
tr	0	Oh , did he hope he was wrong .
tr	0	Josie was taken aback by Jimmy 's accusation .
tr	0	But that was not why she was helping him .
tr	1	" I trust him , Jimmy , " Josie explained .
tr	1	You do like him , " Jimmy said .
tr	1	" I 'd prefer boots , " Mark said .
tr	0	Mark at first was amazed by the number of restaurants available .
tr	3	Not this particular food court , but the idea .
tr	4	" You 've had french fries before , right ? "
tr	1	Jimmy pushed an order of chicken strips in front of Mark .
tr	1	" I think you 're in shock , " Josie said .
tr	1	" You know , waking up in the 21st century .
tr	4	He immediately made a face at the taste .
tr	3	" What do they put in it now ? "
tr	1	Mark finally picked up a chicken strip and tried it .
tr	2	Josie finished a mouthful of food and took a drink .
tr	0	" So what was familiar in the paper ? "
tr	0	" Taking his family on a vacation , apparently .
tr	0	To get away from some scandal , " Mark responded .
tr	1	Politics was one of Jimmy 's favorite subjects .
tr	1	All politicians do stuff like that , " she said .
tr	0	Mark was about to try a french fry and stopped .
tr	0	Ronald Reagan , the actor from California . .
tr	3	" Bet you didn 't see that coming in 1962 . "
tr	2	" Let 's stick to more modern times for now . "
tr	3	" What can you tell me about the VP ? "
tr	3	" Other than - " Mark started to say .
tr	0	Something about it was so very familiar to Mark .
tr	1	He was wasting time sitting here in a mall .
tr	0	Mark 's normally pleasant , laid back eyes seemed angry now .
tr	1	" I remember why I was in Arizona . "
tr	1	" This is Major Campbell ... " the voice said .
tr	0	Mark was surprised , and looked at Jimmy and Josie .
tr	1	" What is your mission status , Colonel ? "
tr	1	" And why I should you trust you ? "
tr	2	" You 've got to come in . "
tr	3	" I haven 't got to do anything . "
tr	2	Josie was more calm , but also looked around .
tr	0	His eyes normal again , he looked calmly at Mark .
tr	1	It was a thin , wide , evil smile .
tr	3	Mark wanted to punch the telepath right in the face .
tr	3	" This one doesn 't like you that much .
tr	1	" What are you doing with something like this ? "
tr	2	The other people on the food court had noticed the commotion .
tr	1	It was hard to miss someone being stunned .
tr	0	" Call it an exorcism , " Mark said .
tr	2	Or maybe laying on the roof , next to a skylight .
tr	3	The agents kept their distance , unsure what to do next .
tr	2	" Let 's not go crazy , shall we ? "
tr	2	Mark , then Josie , stood up slowly .
tr	1	" Nobody likes spending a month in traction . "
tr	2	" Should I be afraid of you ? "
tr	2	The agents could hear coughing coming from the cloud .
tr	3	Standing next to her was the dark silhouette of their target .
tr	1	Electricity immediately began pulsing down the darts ' trailing wires .
tr	4	The agent doubled over , the wind knocked out of him .
tr	0	Mark reached out and pulled at the agent 's gas mask .
tr	3	Mark tugged at the straps , trying to tighten it .
tr	3	But more importantly , the gas had hurt Josie .
tr	4	He was suddenly jerked off his feet before he could finish .
tr	4	He rolled over quickly and sprang to his feet .
tr	0	She wore thigh-high , black leather riding boots .
tr	4	Thick makeup around her eyes gave them a sunken look .
tr	1	They were always flashy and dressing in garish costumes .
tr	0	Mark turned around and started to walk away .
tr	0	Mark again appeared unharmed by the mystic flames .
tr	2	" You 're going to be difficult aren 't you ? "
tr	3	They began to grow bright red then burst into flame .
tr	0	The shards then hung in the air , defying gravity .
tr	1	The ice sliced into his skin in thirty to forty places .
tr	1	Lancing into his arms , his chest , his stomach .
tr	4	His burns from the asphalt debris were now gone as well .
tr	1	It quickly absorbed into the skin of his fingertips and vanished .
tr	3	The impact of the kick caused Mark to grunt out .
tr	4	The blow sounded like a boxer striking a side of beef .
tr	0	Mark caught the cane with his left hand .
tr	2	Blood began to trickle out of her nose .
tr	0	The FBI 's telepath was in a coma .
tr	3	" Yes - I know our Target is still out there .
tr	3	Given what little we know of the Target ?
tr	1	" Yes , sir , " Campbell said .
tr	3	" Get me patched into that truck , pronto ! "
tr	1	She was laughing at something funny he 'd just said .
tr	2	Jimmy turned to Josie to ask what was going on .
tr	1	She was now wearing a suit just like Jimmy 's .
tr	0	She had her hair cut short , and pinned up .
tr	4	" We can take him down just like any other .
tr	4	He sat up suddenly , wondering where he was .
tr	0	Jimmy leaned back against Josie and drank the water .
tr	4	" They weren 't suit salesmen , " Mark said .
tr	3	" So why didn 't you just go with them ? "
tr	4	" No , because I remember the important parts . "
tr	0	Mark waited a moment , then spoke again .
tr	1	He sat up suddenly and began looking out the windows .
tr	3	" Why didn 't they just take your mind over ?
tr	1	Something about the way he said it worried Jimmy .
tr	3	" But I don 't think you want to know . "
tr	2	" No one 's going to disappear you kids . "
tr	1	" Because I 'm that Campbell guy 's boss .
tr	3	It was time to tell these kids what was going on .
tr	2	Not too far from where you found me . "
tr	4	Josie asked , remembering the stone heart in the desert .
tr	3	After my team and I failed to stop it . "
tr	1	Ordinarily , the FBI had capture teams for situations like this .
tr	3	The salesman wore boxer shorts and a dirty white t-shirt .
tr	4	Echo had not enjoyed dressing the last man .
tr	1	And who would be far stronger than normal men .
tr	4	All seventy-five of his fired shots had found their target .
tr	4	The Colonel grabbed up his rifle and looked through the scope .
tr	4	The shapeshifter emerged from the hole in the wall .
tr	2	He kept his cool and continued to methodically reload .
tr	4	Again , the shapeshifter began to be riddled by bullets .
tr	2	" How many times do I have to kill you ? "
tr	3	It was the giant 's turn to attack .
tr	4	His heart was exactly where it should be .
tr	1	This didn 't kill the giant , but it blinded him .
tr	1	It cracked his ribs and lifted him off his feet .
tr	4	He might not have five minutes left after all .
tr	1	Simultaneously , the shapeshifter fired his last shot .
tr	0	His own bones were far harder than a normal man 's .
tr	1	The shapeshifter stepped forward , again transforming into his dragon form .
tr	4	He couldn 't believe he was still alive .
tr	4	" Hang in there , Colonel , " Echo said .
tr	2	Far above , the dragon noticed Echo on the ground .
tr	4	He tore and pulled , chewed and sliced .
tr	4	In seconds , he had torn Echo 's chest open .
tr	4	" Why do you remember 1962 so well ? "
tr	2	" You look good for your age . "
tr	2	" And I don 't do it on purpose . "
tr	4	Maybe one day he 'd tell them more .
tr	1	He was sick of hearing Mark impress Josie .
tr	4	" We don 't even have any super powers ! "
tr	4	He then threw it out the open window beside him .
tr	1	You won 't be in any danger . "
tr	2	Power was something you could hold in your hands .
tr	2	" Why do we both have to go ? "
tr	1	" You won 't be in any danger .
tr	3	" They won 't know he 's telling the truth .
tr	1	" Right ... " Jimmy said , nodding his head slowly .
tr	3	Jimmy thought about the plan for a moment .
tr	1	On particular Chef worked harder than the others .
tr	4	The teens stopped and looked around for a Secret Service agent .
tr	3	" That 's got to be them , " she said .
tr	0	He held up his hands for her to stop .
tr	4	The elevator doors closed and the elevator began to descend .
tr	2	They fanned out , looking around the lobby .
tr	2	He briefly shook blood , brains and gore from his hands .
tr	2	" And where do you think you 're going ? "
tr	1	Jimmy lunged from his position in the corner .
tr	0	And on Agent Williams - particularly his hands and arms .
tr	3	Agents Finch and Todd hastily grabbed for their pistols .
tr	0	" Is that any way to treat a lady ? "
tr	1	In the lobby , the gunfire sounded distant and faint .
tr	2	" And what of you , Colonel ? "
tr	3	Just the guy that 's going to kill you . "
tr	1	They wore him down with spears and stones and flint knives .
tr	1	His flesh hung like rags on his skeleton .
tr	0	The second man dropped his spotlight and swam quickly away .
tr	0	But his rapid ascent came to an abrupt end .
tr	1	Drifting in the ocean current nearby was the Lady Jane Franklin .
tr	1	A land he had visited many times in his youth .
tr	1	His skin was cut in dozens of places from broken glass .
tr	2	" I 'm not done with you . "
tr	4	Impossibly , the human had been holding back before .
tr	3	The two titans toppled backwards , beneath the water .
tr	4	The telepathic assault had rendered him barely able to stand .
tr	0	A great tail and wings sprouted from his back .
tr	4	For Josie , standing behind Keen , it was simply unbelievable .
tr	2	He had pushed off from the bottom of the pool .
tr	1	Josie smashed her elbow against the glass , shattering it .
tr	3	He shoved both hands in the pockets of his tattered pants .
tr	2	" You wouldn 't shoot me , would you ? "
tr	0	A tail and one wing sprouted from its back .
tr	4	But the glass held , blackening under the terrific heat .
tr	1	Then he began to shrink , transforming into his giant form .
tr	4	First one up his nose , then one into his eye .
tr	1	" I 'll be back in a minute . "
tr	2	He turned and nodded to the agent and paramedics .
tr	0	They began to walk away with the gurney and body bag .
tr	0	It was all her fault for making him come along .
tr	3	The coyote pawed at the dirty lump , flipping it over .
tr	0	Its ratty tail elongated , turning hairless and also growing scales .
tr	3	The two guards with the giant 's body wheeled it out .
tr	2	Josie watched the floors count down on the panel .
tr	4	They looked like what you 'd see in a bunker .
tr	0	Light flared as a scanner read his palm print .
tr	1	Calm , almost soothing , despite its obvious machine inflection .
tr	4	She had a stern look on her face .
tr	1	" Who 's in charge of this facility again ? "
tr	2	He nodded for her to go over to Jimmy .
tr	1	" It 's what 's keeping him alive . "
tr	2	So clear , Josie could see down into it .
tr	2	" I don 't understand , " Josie said .
tr	0	She was getting that cold chill up her back again .
tr	1	" I 'm very sorry , " Mark said .
tr	2	" But , technically , he still is . "
tr	0	It was large enough to hold a basketball .
tr	3	There was not the faintest mark or scar .
tr	2	She looked at the doctor , who nodded slowly to her .
tr	4	Then it 'll be like going to sleep . "
tr	1	Josie said , stepping in front of Jimmy .
tr	3	" Turns out , that 's not entirely accurate . "
tr	2	Josie looked back at Jimmy , a frozen figure of stone .
tr	3	" I don 't - " Josie started to say .
tr	0	She had gotten Jimmy back , now he was a statue .
tr	1	BLOOD AND STONE The last shapeshifter has survived .
tr	3	He 's only under twilight anesthetics at this point .
tr	1	Ron 's assistant , Jenny , wasn 't at her desk .
tr	2	" Go on back , Victoria arrived some time ago . "
tr	1	" This is incredible " , said Victoria .
tr	2	" Oh William , of course you 're right ! "
tr	1	" You can monitor his brain activity remotely ? "
tr	1	" It 's possible , " said Ron .
tr	2	Toby entered William 's study , slamming the door loudly .
tr	0	He wanted Victoria to know he was mad .
tr	4	Being connected to the Network was a funded government service .
tr	1	This input was also a type of real-time ongoing census .
tr	2	" Good morning Toby , 007 here . "
tr	0	Toby spotted a pile of unfamiliar papers on an end table .
tr	2	" Hello William , I 'm glad I caught you . "
tr	3	" That 's what I 'm told . "
tr	2	Can we move a functioning organism from one host to another ?
tr	1	Your expenses to run this process should be minimal . "
tr	1	" I know you want to help , " said William .
tr	2	" Some of your notes Victoria , " said Toby .
tr	3	" Thank you Toby , that 's enough .
tr	3	That thing wants to take over my implant ?
tr	2	" Good afternoon , 007 , " said William .
tr	2	too loud , Victoria is going to shut this off !
tr	4	007 , please tell me your instructions for the afternoon . "
tr	2	" I did not give you a motor command . "
tr	1	" The command came from the host . "
tr	0	I guess William went ahead and changed his name .
tr	1	I 'll work a plan to build out his capabilities .
tr	3	" That 's not funny , " said Victoria .
tr	0	The old bastard is already made of money .
tr	0	Which reminds me , how much is he paying you ? "
tr	3	They paused , both letting the statement sink in .
tr	2	We ' ll fix that , then tell William . "
tr	2	" You 're going to tell Toby who you are ? "
tr	2	" A hotel room is no place to raise a child .
tr	4	His developmental problems have prevented him from getting close to anyone .
tr	1	" He 's learning very quickly , " said William .
tr	3	" Why would he want to do that ? "
tr	1	The organism is self-sustaining as long as it has power .
tr	2	" Do you think you can do it ? "
tr	0	Victoria settled back down , snaking her arm around him .
tr	2	" Just pull it on over your cloths . "
tr	0	AI projects had lacked real substance for years .
tr	4	Victoria vowed to never let Alfred near Toby again .
tr	0	All that really mattered to her now was her family .
tr	0	007 waved his hand and gave a charming smile .
tr	0	You have a private message waiting which I cannot read .
tr	3	Information about him must exist in NET 's databases .
tr	1	" Possibly , and others -- many others .
tr	1	She knows many things she won 't say to me . "
tr	3	" She tries to protect you , Toby . "
tr	3	You left off the last three letters to test me .
tr	2	" I 'm asking your mother to join us . "
tr	4	Toby looked into her eyes flatly , holding her gaze .
tr	2	The Human Simulation project holds great promise for the world .
tr	2	Toby looked to Victoria , who nodded in agreement .
tr	0	I have natural parents whom I 'll probably never know .
tr	0	Why hadn 't she told him these things ?
tr	2	" Toby , how do you know these things ? "
tr	0	NET has many sensors and databases , all on their network .
tr	3	Now they will let me work with them , thought Toby .
tr	0	" Alfred is a bad man , " said Toby .
tr	2	" Victoria , Toby and I have some work to do .
tr	1	" What sensor is the closest to you ? "
tr	3	" Can you locate the HS units ? "
tr	4	There are many old processes on the network .
tr	1	Ben said sincerely , tipping his cup in Alfred 's direction .
tr	3	Ron hasn 't taken it to the attorneys yet . "
tr	2	William will be famous , just like you .
tr	3	At least I have plenty of work , thought Ben .
tr	1	Sounds like the implant is working , " said Ben .
tr	4	" Yes , I 've heard the great news ! "
tr	2	" Don 't be hard on yourself . "
tr	4	We 'll let you know when we have something . "
tr	1	Ben and William are still stirring the pot .
tr	2	" I 'm so glad you 're home . "
tr	0	He relaxed a bit ; apparently nothing major was wrong .
tr	1	William felt his knees go weak , his vision going dark .
tr	3	" Toby and I were just getting to know one another .
tr	1	Victoria and I have some explaining to do .
tr	0	Jacob Crawford was wearing blue jeans and a light blue sweater .
tr	1	William turned away , shaking his head and wiping his eyes .
tr	2	" Why would he plan to kill you ? "
tr	3	" Let 's start from the beginning , " said Jacob .
tr	2	" There was obviously much confusion after the bombing .
tr	3	Another long moment passed , William content to wait .
tr	4	There was smoke , glass and bricks everywhere .
tr	4	Then Victoria realized we had missed the meeting .
tr	0	William cleared his throat and rearranged himself on the sofa .
tr	1	William could feel his pulse quickening , his anger rising .
tr	2	Before I could respond he told me about Toby . "
tr	1	William drained his glass again , " This involves Toby ? "
tr	1	" We need to stop drinking , " said William .
tr	1	The Toby bribe was a surprise to us .
tr	2	" What are you going to do now ? "
tr	2	I knew I could count on you . "
tr	1	" I think I understand , " said Jacob .
tr	2	" You 're not hung over , " said Jacob .
tr	0	" Make yourself at home , Jacob , " William said .
tr	0	" And Yes , Toby is a rather amazing lad .
tr	0	Jacob and Victoria dug into their breakfast with abandon .
tr	3	The only security is getting on the network .
tr	3	Without the Scotch he wouldn 't have slept at all .
tr	0	What have you been doing with him ? "
tr	1	William caught Victoria smiling , almost glowing again .
tr	3	" What about the accelerometer suit for Toby ? "
tr	1	" A person directing multiple human sims ... " said William .
tr	1	Victoria 's newfound maternal instincts were on high alert .
tr	0	Oh , and Toby says Jacob is a Hack !
tr	2	William wondered how much he really did understand .
tr	2	Now I 'm moving smoothly and actually with newfound freedom .
tr	2	Victoria was on the other recliner , Jacob on the sofa .
tr	1	007 recognized his new host and began accepting commands .
tr	4	The focus required to operate 007 had been exhilarating .
tr	2	" No , not really , " said Toby .
tr	0	It appears something happened to him , similar to brain damage .
tr	0	" You 're right , something has happened to him . "
tr	0	He was back , his eyes gleaming again .
tr	2	The combination is a leap over regular robotic controls . "
tr	1	007 's skin has many more sensors than my suit .
tr	3	But don 't start thinking you can push commands to me .
tr	2	" My , you do look handsome today .
tr	4	" Tell me , have you seen Dr. Harland today ? "
tr	2	Oh , I 'm not sure how you knew that .
tr	0	007 , Toby , Jacob and Victoria watched her bounce away .
tr	4	" He has the legs of ten men . "
tr	1	And thank you for the rain warning . "
tr	2	I look forward to our coffee date ! "
tr	3	" That 's interesting , " said 007 .
tr	3	Why would he want to do that ? "
tr	2	Can he monitor any of your sensors ? "
tr	1	" Yes , Dr. Cunningham joined a short while ago .
tr	1	" Hi Ben , " said Victoria from off screen .
tr	4	Anyways , it 's been quite useful for me .
tr	1	Pushing memories to bio organisms is the right direction .
tr	1	Ben said skeptically , pushing back into his chair .
tr	3	" Well it works , " Toby said triumphantly .
tr	4	" We need to secure the network . "
tr	2	" Alfred will love that , " said Ben .
tr	2	" Yes , but only temporarily , " William lied .
tr	4	We 'll have a news leak soon if someone slips up .
tr	3	Publicity is not what Toby needs right now . "
tr	0	" Not a bad idea , " said William .
tr	1	" Sharing this now sounds risky , " Ben protested .
tr	2	Alfred paused , looking into Toby 's face on the display .
tr	3	" Toby , is that an accelerometer suit ? "
tr	1	Victoria moved into the picture , standing behind Toby 's recliner .
tr	1	" I like dealing with venture capitalists and making deals .
tr	4	" He said he planned all the details of the trip .
tr	1	" He said something similar to me , " Victoria said .
tr	1	Both Ben and William were visible in the display .
tr	0	" Then why was he dealing with them ? "
tr	1	I suspect it was just part of doing business there .
tr	2	" So what do you two think ? "
tr	3	It ' s pretty lame , actually . "
tr	2	They were bonding , as a group with a common goal .
tr	1	" He 's expensing his meals to terrorists ? "
tr	1	" No , I meant the guilt is eating him .
tr	2	Typically , they level major parts of the building .
tr	3	" It was naïve to trust Alfred . "
tr	0	" We can take advantage of that for now .
tr	0	" Mac sounds like a man 's name . "
tr	1	Do you mind if I take your picture ? "
tr	2	" How do you want me to pose ? "
tr	2	Hopefully this won 't take too long . "
tr	2	Which reminds me , how about some artwork ?
tr	3	" Just stick to the plan , please .
tr	2	Maybe I should work on the other one .
tr	4	" You 're planning to deceive someone . "
tr	3	" You 're the best at both . "
tr	2	" Hello , Toby , " said Jacob ignoring the question .
tr	1	I 'm sending the shutdown and boot 006 commands now . "
tr	1	" He 's down , " said William .
tr	4	" I can 't tell the difference . "
tr	1	He cannot do anything else right now . "
tr	1	" Alfred sends encrypted messages most days about this time .
tr	1	" I think he forgot something , " William said .
tr	1	" The video feed is working , " said William .
tr	1	This is a less expensive testing tool , no ? "
tr	3	" Yes , but it has vast application potential . "
tr	4	My engineers will be happy to have another toy .
tr	1	" Oh my G ... " Victoria was hyperventilating .
tr	2	" For a fortune , no doubt . "
tr	1	" I 'll bring 006 home , " said Toby .
tr	2	Oh , I wish you could talk . "
tr	2	Toby and Victoria will be here soon . "
tr	4	As they approached , the commotion stopped immediately .
tr	3	" Well , that 's just great , " said 007 .
tr	2	" The glass is always half full , " said William .
tr	3	To hell with them , they could wait .
tr	0	He had taken the stairs twice today already .
tr	1	Hopefully it would establish a trail of incriminating evidence .
tr	0	" Alfred , you may call me Ahmad .
tr	2	" It 's good to finally meet you . "
tr	4	Ignoring the comment , Ahmad pointed over Alfred 's shoulder .
tr	2	He recovered quickly , motioning for them to join the group .
tr	2	" Allow me to introduce Victoria and Toby Crawford . "
tr	0	" Hello , young man , " said Ahmad .
tr	0	" Alfred has told me about your implant .
tr	2	I would love to hear what you think of it . "
tr	2	" I asked you to join us later .
tr	2	What are you doing here now , young lady ? "
tr	0	" That is correct , " said Ahmad .
tr	1	" An interesting conclusion to draw based on limited information . "
tr	2	" We will join you in the lab shortly . "
tr	1	It is a privilege to see you again . "
tr	1	" Why am I not dealing with ... ? "
tr	2	For now you have some technology to share with us . "
tr	1	" I will direct the transaction as I see fit .
tr	3	The two promptly turned and walked toward the exit .
tr	1	I think he may have worked for Victoria .
tr	3	" Let 's turn 006 over to them now .
tr	1	" I 'll go out with him , " said Victoria .
tr	0	" Yes , that 's brilliant , " said Jacob .
tr	1	" Run to the limo , " cried William .
tr	2	" Toby , we mean you no harm .
tr	1	" My name is Mohammed , and this is Mohan .
tr	4	Toby simply nodded , focusing intensely on the data feeds .
tr	1	" Why are they using Indian names ? "
tr	1	Why was Toby leaving the building in the first place ?
tr	4	They certainly were entering and exiting the building as they pleased .
tr	1	It was time to visit William 's lab .
tr	1	Surely , none of this was an accident .
tr	4	" You realize of course that we have security cameras .
tr	2	" Your office is on the second floor , no ?
tr	1	" I will meet you in your office . "
tr	4	What a fool I 've been , thought Alfred .
tr	3	" He must have run up the stairs without Alfred . "
tr	0	Jacob asked , as he paced around the room .
tr	4	Jacob cleared his throat , looking intensely at her .
tr	4	Victoria rolled her eyes and joined him pacing the room .
tr	0	Mohammed was pacing in front of Alfred 's desk .
tr	1	" It was your choice to involve him in our business .
tr	0	" Alfred shot him through the desk , " said Toby .
tr	2	" Shouldn 't I call for medical help ? "
tr	2	" You know how to drive , right ? "
tr	3	" Today you get your chance on city streets .
tr	1	Have you driven around town with William ? "
tr	2	007 overrode his central control monitor to match Toby 's respiration .
tr	3	Let 's just get it out of here .
tr	2	You really should use terminology from your own generation . "
tr	2	Just act like you know what you 're doing . "
tr	3	" What exactly is the plan , young Toby ? "
tr	2	How clumsy of me not to have noticed . "
tr	3	I just want to get the story out of Ahmad first .
tr	2	I 'm going to play the tough guy . "
tr	2	Back up to the second office window . "
tr	0	" 007 , drive away calmly and quickly .
tr	1	I see no human activity within 100 yards of this location .
tr	1	" The security system shows you in my lab .
tr	3	" That 's right , it 's too dangerous .
tr	3	" That won 't be possible , " said Toby .
tr	2	Okay , he won 't tell you . "
tr	4	" Yes , I did arrange the details .
tr	4	" We worked together for three years , " said Victoria .
tr	1	It indicated that he and 007 were in William 's lab .
tr	0	" Your dearly departed Dr. Harland was a criminal . "
tr	1	Victoria asked , feigning surprise , looking to Jacob .
tr	3	It 's not in your nature to take life . "
tr	0	" Ben is a supremely capable man , " said Jacob .
tr	3	At that moment , an explosion rocked the building .
tr	1	" He 's running , " said Victoria .
tr	0	The stairwell door slammed shut again and he was gone .
tr	2	Luckily , Jacob spotted him from across the lobby .
tr	2	" You set off the bomb on purpose ? "
tr	2	" The bomb was rigged , " said Toby .
tr	4	The parking lot and some power lines would be damaged .
tr	0	Victoria hugged Toby so hard he could hardly breathe .
tr	2	" I 'm so proud of you . "
tr	4	The technical hurdles , the excuses , went on and on .
tr	4	Eventually the FBI found higher priority projects and walked away .
tr	0	Sarah frowned and caught her husband 's eye .
tr	1	" Let 's go find those loggers , " she said .
tr	1	" This is what their bacon looks like . "
tr	2	" Well , so is bacon , really . "
tr	4	To have things not the same as where you live . "
tr	0	John cut a piece of ham and ate it .
tr	0	" Eating an authentic Irish breakfast , are you ? "
tr	1	" Just kidding , " he said , grinning sheepishly .
tr	3	" You got all the directions to the rental cottage ? "
tr	2	" Don 't run over ' em , Dad . "
tr	4	" And man , those sheep are dirty . "
tr	1	" Lots of mud in Ireland , " Sarah murmured .
tr	2	" Are you losing your grip , honey ? "
tr	1	" I 'm dying of thirst , " he said .
tr	0	John leaped out of the car and ran to the barn .
tr	1	" Are you positive this is it ? "
tr	1	" Of course not , " she said , still seated .
tr	2	John ran to the front door and pushed it open .
tr	2	" It 's just got one room , " he said .
tr	1	" Well , " David said with a sigh .
tr	1	" To quote my son , this sucks . "
tr	0	A large king-sized bed was pushed up against the far wall .
tr	0	" It 's actually very cozy , " David said .
tr	2	" Look , David , I 'm sorry , okay ? "
tr	4	Sarah buttoned her sweater and rubbed her hands together .
tr	3	CHAPTER TWO It happened sometime during their first night .
tr	2	Too many things to fall on his head . "
tr	1	" It 's the same droning idiocy as back home .
tr	2	David yawned and sat up beside his wife .
tr	1	" It 's raining outside , Dad . "
tr	0	" Take him outside , Sarah , " David said .
tr	2	The two of them stood on the porch .
tr	2	" It 's going to be okay . "
tr	0	The clouds had blown away , leaving a clear blue sky .
tr	3	" But it just goes to a recording . "
tr	2	Probably wouldn 't be able to get a hotel room .
tr	2	" Did they say who did this to us ? "
tr	3	Just knew the US was under attack . "
tr	1	It was over in less than five seconds .
tr	4	" I 'm not really sure , " he said .
tr	0	" Sarah , let 's stay calm , okay ? "
tr	1	" John , wan na go into town ? "
tr	1	" I 'll drive , " he said .
tr	3	We 're not taking the car today . "
tr	1	David ran his fingers through his hair in exasperation .
tr	2	John looked from one parent to the other .
tr	2	David turned to him and put his arm around him .
tr	1	" Yes , son , " he said .
tr	0	" That big flash that just happened , " Sarah said .
tr	2	" So , now do we ride ? "
tr	2	" Not for you , " he said stubbornly .
tr	2	David looked at his son who nodded enthusiastically .
tr	2	Horses are not like golf carts , you know .
tr	1	" But I 'm sorry for your troubles .
tr	1	" Sure , no , " she said .
tr	3	" Just something terrible bad , that 's for sure .
tr	4	She nodded to the shelves in her store .
tr	2	What took you so long to come to town ? "
tr	2	" We woulda driven , " John said .
tr	3	" But our car won 't start . "
tr	4	David gave his wife 's shoulders a squeeze .
tr	2	" We 'll look , " he said .
tr	4	They live about five miles the other side .
tr	3	" That may be a bit trickier . "
tr	3	Guess the locals don 't eat out much . "
tr	2	" We 're good , family , " David said .
tr	0	" And you don 't have any theories about what happened ?
tr	3	It 's a total destruction of the infrastructure . "
tr	3	Sarah stared out into the dark Irish night .
tr	1	Sarah could see David was working something out in his mind .
tr	0	" Where do you imagine that damn goat is ? "
tr	2	" Hand me the lead , would you , David ? "
tr	0	He was a dark bay with a blaze on his forehead .
tr	0	" No , I mean about everything , " Sarah said .
tr	4	She knew she was telegraphing her anxiety and frustration to him .
tr	0	" Okay , Sarah , that 's crazy .
tr	3	" Let 's find the damn goat . "
tr	3	The goat was in the pasture with a kid .
tr	0	He laughed as the baby goat jumped around him .
tr	4	" Does this mean we can 't milk her ? "
tr	4	" God , this keeps getting weirder and weirder . "
tr	4	" Do we let them run wild out here ? "
tr	0	" Sarah , I have no idea , " David replied .
tr	1	He was holding the squirming kid in his arms .
tr	2	" You 've got a child to think of . "
tr	2	" How do we cook ' em ? "
tr	4	" What if they 've all been killed ? "
tr	1	Our family is fine , I know it .
tr	3	" What if it 's worse for them ?
tr	2	She looked at David and he nodded at John .
tr	1	" Promise , son , " he said .
tr	0	" Go back to sleep , Sarah , " he said .
tr	0	" What 's on the agenda for today ? "
tr	0	John said through a yawn as he sat up in bed .
tr	4	" Hey , guy , how long you been awake ? "
tr	0	" That 's called a star , " his mother said .
tr	2	" I 'll look in the barn . "
tr	2	They stood in the middle of the small paddock .
tr	0	" Come on , Sarah , " David said reassuringly .
tr	0	" You have to wear a hard hat , John .
tr	0	David handed Sarah the reins of the big bay named Dan .
tr	0	" Had a girl friend in high school who rode . "
tr	1	" This is so great , Mom , " he said .
tr	4	She adjusted the buckle on his helmet for a tighter fit .
tr	3	" Try that , sweetheart , " she said .
tr	3	We don 't want to get back in the dark . "
tr	2	The feeling of panic would not go away .
tr	0	" We can 't afford any accidents , okay ? "
tr	0	" Which way , do you think ? "
tr	2	" I 'll lead , " John said .
tr	0	Sarah tried to remember how far away the ocean was .
tr	0	Sarah watched them both on the road ahead of her .
tr	4	Her spine stiffened , which slowed her horse .
tr	3	But for Mack Finn , it had just come together .
tr	3	" Isn 't this great , Mom ? "
tr	1	John pointed to a running rabbit along the rock wall .
tr	1	Sarah squinted in the direction he was indicating .
tr	4	" Maybe they are our caretakers , " she said .
tr	1	" He 's just alerting his owners , " David said .
tr	1	" We 're your neighbors from Cairn Cottage . "
tr	1	" I think we 're freaking him out , David .
tr	3	Just then , an old woman came out into the yard .
tr	2	" Yes , that would be us , " David said .
tr	0	" Have you gone totally daft , man ?
tr	4	They steered their horses back to the cottage .
tr	3	" I 'll just put the kettle on . "
tr	0	" We 're at ... it 's a war ? "
tr	2	Wouldn 't know one end from the other . "
tr	0	It was simple and poor but tidy and clean .
tr	2	You 'll do what you have to . "
tr	0	She leaned over and patted Sarah 's hand .
tr	0	She laughed at her own joke and Sarah laughed too .
tr	0	" He 's with the horses , " John said .
tr	2	She handed David and John their tea mugs .
tr	1	She winked at John and he grinned back .
tr	4	They looked apprehensive at their leader 's entrance .
tr	0	One seated man had a squirming puppy in his lap .
tr	1	Finn knew the boy hadn 't eaten his dinner .
tr	0	" Did you say something , Gerry ? "
tr	2	" The front door 's open , " she said .
tr	1	" They took mostly the useless stuff , " he said .
tr	4	" And the axe and the knives . "
tr	2	" I hope they choke on the food . "
tr	2	It 's not a good thing , though , you know ?
tr	3	Sarah assumed it had something to do with better fortifying them .
tr	0	It was so easy to take care of him back home .
tr	3	" You 're doing it without butter ? "
tr	2	" I didn 't know you knew so much about cooking .
tr	0	" Oh , yeah , " John said .
tr	0	" You just had breakfast , " Sarah said with exasperation .
tr	2	" Two spoons of jam and tea without sugar or milk .
tr	1	" I hate drinking tea without milk . "
tr	2	Not just a recipe , but a cookbook .
tr	0	We don 't have an automatic washing machine any more .
tr	4	" I thought all pastures were fenced . "
tr	0	" I thought he was in the house . "
tr	3	What if he gets caught out here and it storms ?
tr	3	She estimated that she was about fifteen minutes from the cottage .
tr	2	He 's up in the far pasture looking for you . "
tr	0	" John , " she whispered into his hair .
tr	4	Did you tell anyone you were leaving ? "
tr	0	" So , what 's with the sheep ? "
tr	2	" We can make wool from their fur , you know ?
tr	4	" Next time tell someone you 're leaving , though .
tr	0	" Yeah , for sweaters and blankets and stuff .
tr	1	David and John were on their feet in an instant .
tr	2	David put his hand on John and nodded .
tr	2	David jerked open the door and strode out onto the porch .
tr	4	Sarah fried up the last of the eggs .
tr	2	He looked up at Sarah and she nodded .
tr	1	" I provided for the family , " he said .
tr	1	John pulled his plate back and picked up his fork .
tr	2	David sighed and reached for a slice of cold toasted bread .
tr	0	The first time , he brought fresh eggs back with him .
tr	1	Besides , Sarah thought , all of this was just temporary .
tr	3	Best to just sit tight and ride it out .
tr	3	" But they 're not stupid , " he said .
tr	3	Got stuck in the ditch over by Blue Rock ? "
tr	2	" How do you know the name of it ? "
tr	4	They 're like all freaked out ' Where are we going ?
tr	0	she said as she sat down heavily into a kitchen chair .
tr	3	" Took everything but left the animals to wander .
tr	2	" Are you worried about the two of you ? "
tr	1	Sarah asked , her own worry ratcheting up .
tr	2	Sarah saw that John looked a little nervous too .
tr	0	" Not at all , " she said .
tr	4	We 're really the Three Musketeers , aren 't we ?
tr	0	" Yeah , I know what you mean . "
tr	4	John opened a kitchen drawer and withdrew a box of bullets .
tr	4	He pushed the box across the table to her .
tr	2	" Does Dad know how to shoot it ? "
tr	2	" Do we know how to load it ? "
tr	2	" You got ta cock it , " John said .
tr	2	So , how to describe our daily round here ?
tr	0	" A letter to Nana and Grandpa , " she said .
tr	0	she asked , handing John a towel for his wet hair .
tr	2	They 're all wearing wool coats , you know .
tr	0	Sarah said as she poured her own tea and sat down .
tr	0	It 's really hard just making breakfast happen .
tr	0	" It is hard here , " Sarah said .
tr	0	" Why aren 't you with John ? "
tr	4	" Sarah , he doesn 't need me .
tr	3	And why didn 't you tell me about the gun ? "
tr	4	This was nuts beyond believable , he thought .
tr	4	He pulled a blanket over his shoulders and shivered .
tr	1	He finished the biscuit and wiped his fingers on his jeans .
tr	0	He wondered if she thought that about him .
tr	2	And David found himself smiling as he dropped off to sleep .
tr	0	" Hey , John , " he said .
tr	2	David packed his saddlebag and tightened Rocky 's girth .
tr	2	" Don 't stay out too long , okay , sport ?
tr	1	" I 'll be fine , " John said .
tr	2	" You don 't need the gun , " David said .
tr	0	She 'd left her own hardhat in the barn .
tr	2	We 're gon na have to shoot him . "
tr	0	Why do we have to go through this ?
tr	3	Sarah watched the dog retreat -- but reluctantly , she thought .
tr	0	" Grab a bite to eat and feed Star .
tr	4	Sarah couldn 't remember ever seeing him look so tired .
tr	1	John cried out , with laughter in his voice .
tr	2	" You killed ... you had to ... " John said .
tr	0	John ran to the barn with the big horse .
tr	0	He had a plan , a bloody , wonderful plan .
tr	3	At least not with the ones who didn 't know him .
tr	4	The dairy and all of the other shops were boarded up .
tr	0	For Sarah , her day began before it was light out .
tr	4	Later , she lit the cook stove and made the tea .
tr	3	At first light , she often wrote to her parents .
tr	1	She couldn 't help but think any day now .
tr	4	When she fed them , they rushed to greet her .
tr	1	They all had to do difficult things in this new life .
tr	0	John came to the breakfast table and sat down .
tr	4	She set his mug of tea down on the table .
tr	1	" That would be dumb , naming chickens .
tr	4	She watched the puppies from the kitchen window .
tr	2	" So when you gon na do it ? "
tr	1	" As soon as possible , " she said .
tr	0	She made a face at him that made him laugh .
tr	0	He laughed again , amused at his own wit .
tr	4	" Breakfast in a tick , " she whispered .
tr	4	Would they reach out and help keep them safe ?
tr	2	David nodded and joined Seamus at the table .
tr	1	" Morning , Seamus , " he said .
tr	2	And he still had a full afternoon 's chores to do .
tr	1	I am , in fact , freeing you .
tr	2	Seamus ' dog lay dead in the ditch .
tr	1	How did he miss this , this morning ?
tr	1	Was it just an act of senseless violence ?
tr	1	" Sorry about this , Seamus , " David said .
tr	0	" Did you hear him bark at all last night ? "
tr	2	David nodded and turned to head back to the house .
tr	4	" I 'll get the shovel , " he said .
tr	0	Sarah sat down with a cup of tea .
tr	2	She stood up to look out the window again .
tr	0	Probably got more worked up about that than was rational .
tr	1	She 's American , " he said to his companions .
tr	0	" Mack , you hear this maniac ? "
tr	1	" You can 't just shoot us , " he said .
tr	0	" Language , please , John , " Sarah said .
tr	3	" I just knew I had to stop it now . "
tr	2	David looked over his shoulder to the other room .
tr	2	" Do you think he 's okay ? "
tr	3	We were joking about shooting them to try to scare them .
tr	1	No , I ... I didn 't think twice . "
tr	0	Their first raid and he had made a bollocks of it .
tr	1	the girl Jules had asked as she bound up his arm .
tr	0	" Hush , girl , " he said .
tr	1	" Fine , " she said , getting up again .
tr	4	David would keep the gun with him while he worked .
tr	4	She carried a knife and two bottles of Côte de Rhône .
tr	2	" You 'll all be knowing me , " he said .
tr	1	Mike 's hands rested on his hips as he addressed her .
tr	3	I think Father McGinty will take issue with that . "
tr	1	" I 'll not be coming back , " she said .
tr	0	She had trail ridden for years , and happily .
tr	2	So she stopped going out on the trails .
tr	0	She had always been afraid of big horses .
tr	0	The Irish and their music , she thought .
tr	2	A lot less tricky with a fully saddled horse .
tr	4	She walked Dan to the line of horses .
tr	1	" It 's fair to killing me , you see . "
tr	0	The young woman had a problem , that was clear .
tr	1	But if your husband could come and dig out the well .
tr	4	" So you see the problem in it . "
tr	4	It looked like it had been built in the fifteen century .
tr	0	I can 't not check on him , she thought .
tr	3	She returned to the frontcourt of the cottage and dismounted .
tr	2	He was lying on the floor in front of the couch .
tr	2	There was nothing she could do for Devon now .
tr	4	She waited for him to notice her or make a move .
tr	3	Sarah resisted the urge to point the gun at him .
tr	1	" I 'm a friend of Devon 's sister-in-law . "
tr	3	" I 'll let you get on with it . "
tr	2	" Do you know how he died ? "
tr	2	The light was nearly dusk but still Sarah lingered .
tr	2	Did you not know he was the village schoolmaster ?
tr	0	Mike watched Sarah ride off and shook his head in amazement .
tr	2	" How do you know about her ? "
tr	0	" Took a fancy , did ya , Da ?
tr	2	" Aw , no , why , me ? "
tr	2	I 'm really getting the hang of haggling .
tr	3	Thought you 'd get a chuckle out of that , Dad .
tr	3	Too much heat got lost with the fireplace .
tr	0	Ten days later , David still hadn 't come back .
tr	4	She would make enough for all three of their meals today .
tr	2	Sarah stood up and went to the front door again .
tr	4	" You were watching , " he said .
tr	1	" You 're right , " she said with a smile .
tr	3	" It 's just straight down that road .
tr	2	" Well , we can pray , you know ? "
tr	0	" Now , John ... " Sarah said .
tr	1	John jumped again and clapped his hands in his excitement .
tr	4	It 'll take me two secs to saddle everybody up . "
tr	1	" First thing in the morning , " she said .
tr	1	He was back in one of the stalls not listening anyway .
tr	0	Hope is a wonderful thing , she thought .
tr	4	She looked over her shoulder at Mack still asleep .
tr	4	She 'd paid the price for that mistake early on .
tr	1	Until this moment , Finn had not mentioned it again .
tr	4	" And you checked on him a few weeks ago ? "
tr	1	" I went to visit me Mum , " she said .
tr	1	" Yes , yes , " she said .
tr	1	Finn looked at her and then burst out laughing .
tr	2	Oh , gosh , Mom , can you please be okay ?
tr	1	It was so dark , she couldn 't see his face .
tr	2	But he 's all trembling and he 's limping , too .
tr	1	I think I saw him fall down . "
tr	1	Worse , what she was seeing was slightly double .
tr	1	" Is it ... is it night already ? "
tr	3	" Well , maybe it wasn 't that long .
tr	1	I saw it when we came out this morning . "
tr	4	" What if there are snakes or rats inside ? "
tr	1	( I did , too , but am fine . )
tr	1	But now , it seems such a waste .
tr	2	So , take care of each other , you two .
tr	2	" No Dad , " he said quietly .
tr	3	" We 've got the best part of Christmas , though .
tr	4	That 's what we need to remember . "
tr	2	Sarah spilled her tea and John bolted for the front door .
tr	1	His lips were cracked and dry , his throat parched .
tr	2	A threat she had obviously made good on .
tr	3	This signaled the fact that his nightmare would resume shortly .
tr	4	Why hadn 't he realized it couldn 't be true ?
tr	3	David struggled to a sitting position against the headboard .
tr	1	David sat down heavily in one of the kitchen chairs .
tr	2	It took us nearly four hours to ride back . "
tr	3	" So it 's not you that needs help ? "
tr	4	Julie looked away and her mother answered for her .
tr	3	I practically had to beat her to do it . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , mister , " she said .
tr	4	" Can you show me the well ? "
tr	2	He could move about the room but not leave it .
tr	4	The morning was cold and she needed to start the tea .
tr	0	A cold roast chicken with potatoes and even gravy .
tr	2	" Your mother must go and find your Da .
tr	0	Seamus can wait , sure he can . "
tr	4	" Needing to feel useful , are you ? "
tr	2	Sarah looked again at the snow clouds outside the kitchen window .
tr	0	Sarah reached out and touched the old woman 's hand .
tr	1	" I promise I 'll find him . "
tr	2	Betta stood by David 's bed and wrung her hands .
tr	0	His head was aching and he felt so weak .
tr	3	" I did what I thought was best .
tr	1	" Margie and Jamie came this morning , did you know ?
tr	2	" You heard them , Danny , didn 't you ?
tr	4	" They were ... people were ... here ? "
tr	2	" You hate me , don 't you ? "
tr	2	His words formed slowly as if he were speaking through cotton .
tr	2	Will I not even be able to go tomorrow ?
tr	1	David struggled to sit up and pulled uselessly against his restraints .
tr	3	" The smart ones need time to think it all through .
tr	1	I felt like I did change it . "
tr	0	David felt like he was an actor in a grainy movie .
tr	1	An actor with no lines and no future .
tr	1	And us with no workin ' cellphone cameras .
tr	1	" No one 's messing with us . "
tr	1	" Stop worrying , Sarah , " she said .
tr	4	She turned half way down the drive to wave .
tr	1	Finn sat in Betta 's kitchen drinking a mug of tea .
tr	0	The horse was his now , he thought with satisfaction .
tr	1	" What do we usually do , you daft bugger ? "
tr	1	" Mind if I finish me bloody tea , first ? "
tr	2	Finn looked in the direction of the bedroom .
tr	1	" Hey , Seamus , " she said .
tr	3	Sarah sat down on the bed next to him .
tr	2	" Let 's go to her , okay ?
tr	1	" Right , yes , okay , " she said .
tr	2	Dear God , had Seamus found the gun ?
tr	3	Her first instinct was to rush out onto the porch .
tr	2	She looked around the room for a weapon .
tr	2	Come out or we shoot the old man . "
tr	0	Sarah saw a shadow cross the back window .
tr	1	" Say something , you stupid cow , " he snarled .
tr	2	" I told you , " the one man said .
tr	0	The lout looked at Sarah with naked admiration .
tr	3	At least at first , " the other man said .
tr	4	" Okay , Granddad , here 's where you get out .
tr	2	" Did you happen to find my reading glasses ? "
tr	0	Sarah put out a hand to touch her on the shoulder .
tr	2	" It was awful , they were awful .
tr	2	Now I have to go to bed . "
tr	0	" It 's late , John , " Sarah said .
tr	0	" You mean , him not acting daft and all ? "
tr	3	" The ones you turned out into the pasture ? "
tr	1	" One of the horses was Rocky , " she said .
tr	1	" God willing , Dad and I will be back tonight .
tr	4	If they tell you to hide , you hide .
tr	1	It hadn 't rained or snowed in 24 hours .
tr	0	" You 're right , " he said , watching her .
tr	4	" Wonder what she 's doing here . "
tr	3	The frustration coursed through her until she wanted to scream .
tr	1	He was grinning broadly and looked very drunk .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , missus , " Donovan said .
tr	2	I wouldn 't expect any trouble from them soon . "
tr	3	" He tried to hurt my boy . "
tr	4	He 's been a worthless piece of shite from the beginning .
tr	2	Come in to his own , you might say .
tr	0	Donovan held out a hand as if to restrain her .
tr	1	" Stop ... calling me ' missus . '
tr	0	" Look , Sarah , you can 't leave . "
tr	0	" Sarah , please , " Mike said .
tr	2	Donovan moved over to the window to look out .
tr	2	Don 't look for us until tomorrow . "
tr	4	" I 'm surprised he hasn 't done it before now .
tr	0	He turned away from his son to speak to Sarah .
tr	0	" And this was two days ago ? "
tr	2	" Go on , get going , " he said .
tr	1	Sarah closed her legs firmly around Dan and urged him forward .
tr	2	For now , she had to get back to him .
tr	0	" You nearly gave me a heart attack . "
tr	2	From the looks of it , all of them .
tr	1	She closed his eyes and saw her hand was shaking badly .
tr	2	One of John 's dogs lay dead in her path .
tr	4	She didn 't take her eyes off the burning cottage .
tr	1	" I 'm sure of it , " he said .
tr	3	" That 's not good , " he admitted .
tr	2	Donovan had come not forty minutes after John was found .
tr	0	" What a nice man you are , " she said .
tr	2	She took another sip and let the alcohol do its work .
tr	0	She handed Sarah a bowl of stew and a dented spoon .
tr	1	" I 'm Fiona , Mike 's big sister . "
tr	1	" I guess we 're famous , " Sarah said .
tr	0	Sarah snapped her head to look at Donovan .
tr	3	I don 't want to say this twice . "
tr	2	Your animals are gone , your house is gone . "
tr	1	It will be safer for you with us .
tr	0	" I can 't leave , " Sarah said .
tr	2	" For the love of God , why not ? "
tr	1	he said , his face twisted in confusion .
tr	2	Good people to have with you in a fight .
tr	2	Without electricity or doctors or formula or baby monitors .
tr	0	" Basically , what happened was this , " Donovan said .
tr	4	" They 're working on that now , " Mike replied .
tr	2	" Our country will help you , " John said .
tr	2	Me , I like to know about why .
tr	4	Her concerns now centered on his very survival .
tr	4	Dear God , had she really lost him forever ?
tr	3	" Sound pretty nuts when you put it like that . "
tr	3	" They 'll just come do this to you eventually . "
tr	1	" I ... where is it you 're going ?
tr	4	" Why not stay where you were ? "
tr	3	" So you 're betting that this chaos is permanent ? "
tr	0	" And watch each other 's backs . "
tr	0	Sarah nodded as if it made a lot of sense .
tr	0	" Yeah , " she said , watching him work .
tr	4	His lashes were long and he regarded her sleepily .
tr	0	" Probably same as you , " he said .
tr	1	" I talked to Fi this morning , " she said .
tr	3	But it doesn 't take away the threat .
tr	3	" It 's not at all the same thing . "
tr	0	It was a good chair with a comfortable pad .
tr	0	They had found the farm abandoned a few days earlier .
tr	4	He recognized that he missed the girl Jules .
tr	2	It was all he could do to protect himself from her .
tr	4	He was used to just taking when he needed something .
tr	4	" Hey , Guv , " he said easily .
tr	1	It annoyed Finn that Brendan never acted worried about him .
tr	0	The American looked up and , amazingly , smiled .
tr	3	The Yank was his winning ticket to getting her .
tr	2	" So you got enough to eat ? "
tr	1	Finn stood up and stared down at the man .
tr	0	David watched the scruffy little gypsy walk away .
tr	2	" I don 't know , man , " David said .
tr	0	" Thanks , man , " he said .
tr	4	" I really appreciate everything you 've done for me . "
tr	4	Sarah looked away to hide the emotion stinging her eyes again .
tr	1	" Same place I got the first bit , Aidan Kinney .
tr	0	" I 'm glad for you , Sarah .
tr	1	he said , with hope in his voice .
tr	1	Donovan surveyed the picnic table in front of him .
tr	2	Sarah stood next to him and looked down on the table .
tr	0	Sarah called after him but he kept walking .
tr	4	" Come on , Mike , " she said .
tr	1	" In fact , it sounds more like planned suicide . "
tr	2	" Which is what I 've been telling you all along .
tr	3	" Don 't do that , " " Do what ? "
tr	2	This is not bloody England , you know .
tr	2	" I have no doubt you would . "
tr	0	He may have encouraged that assumption more than was absolutely accurate .
tr	0	Would they shoot first when he hailed them ?
tr	4	The words were as friendly as the tone was deadly .
tr	4	Why were these thoughts invading her head now of all times ?
tr	4	David began to move in the direction of the camp .
tr	2	" Why would you willingly be his house slave ? "
tr	2	" Clearly , you do , " David said .
tr	0	Name calling me isn 't a way to do that . "
tr	3	David held up his hands to illustrate the point .
tr	0	What she saw , instead , was bad .
tr	2	She could see now it was Donovan on the ground .
tr	1	" Yes , John , " she said .
tr	0	" Who says I don 't have a plan ? "
tr	1	" I guess so , " he said .
tr	3	Fiona walked out of the stall carrying two empty tea mugs .
tr	1	She came in quietly and knelt down in front of him .
tr	2	Donovan looked at her fiercely and spoke in a low voice .
tr	2	If you show yourself , you 'll be shot .
tr	4	" Then I make my move , " she said .
tr	2	" Does he know how much you love him ? "
tr	1	" Have your guns out -- one in each hand .
tr	4	Kids the age of young John there . "
tr	1	" What is my purpose in coming into the camp ?
tr	1	" God , I wish I were going with you .
tr	0	" Be careful , Sarah , " he said .
tr	0	Plus , the American bastard and Brendan were still not back .
tr	0	Is there any way this can have a happy ending ?
tr	3	It had been the exact right thing to say .
tr	4	They were no taller than her but wiry and muscled .
tr	3	Let 's get these two back to camp .
tr	1	" We 're bringin ' him a little bonus . "
tr	2	" What do you mean you couldn 't find him ? "
tr	2	Oh , please don 't do this . "
tr	0	Sarah stared at the gypsy and licked her lips .
tr	2	One of the gypsies who was holding John asked .
tr	4	They held the boy between them in front of their leader .
tr	0	The gypsy holding him gave his jacket a hard jerk .
tr	0	Oh , my God , she thought , her stomach roiling .
tr	0	John scrambled to his feet and ran to Sarah .
tr	1	" Mom , I 'm sorry , " he said .
tr	0	" What are we gon na do ? "
tr	0	The bedroom had a window facing the back of the farm .
tr	0	Did he hurt you when he tied your hands ? "
tr	2	" You didn 't bring a gun , did you ? "
tr	3	" Yes , that 's right , that 's right . "
tr	2	" Don 't you want me to cut you loose ? "
tr	4	But they wouldn 't be for long if Sarah screamed .
tr	1	" Tie ' im , " Finn said .
tr	4	" Bet you have three cars , don 't you ? "
tr	2	Blood blossomed in large crimson blots in the knife 's trail .
tr	1	John scrambled off Finn 's thrashing body and grabbed the rifle .
tr	2	" I 'll live , " he said hoarsely .
tr	2	They could hear loud voices outside the bedroom door .
tr	2	She heard John yell out : " You got ' im !
tr	4	There 's about a hundred gypsies out there . "
tr	1	" It hurts like shit , " he said , wincing .
tr	1	" This back bedroom is not safe , " she said .
tr	0	Maybe we should stay -- " " Oy !
tr	2	" Don 't look at me , " David said .
tr	2	John ran to the back window before Sarah could stop him .
tr	3	The pony trap sat on the side of the barn .
tr	4	The boy was so much older than his eleven years .
tr	0	They watched David take Gavin 's gun and leave .
tr	4	John jerked his head absentmindedly to indicate behind him .
tr	2	" It won 't close or something . "
tr	2	David spoke as he followed his son from around the house .
tr	2	You , too , " she said , turning to David .
tr	0	" You know , Mike -- " Sarah started .
tr	4	" Doesn 't work , " Gavin called from the hearth .
tr	0	" Come on , Da , " Gavin said .
tr	4	Mike placed his whiskey glass on the table .
tr	4	David asked , leaning eagerly over the table toward Mike .
tr	1	" That is news , " he said .
tr	3	But something else caught his attention at the moment .
tr	4	She laughed at his insolence and flexed her mighty biceps .
tr	2	Lucky thing for you , too , boy !
tr	2	" Why , what do you suppose ? "
tr	1	" And now what do you intend doing ? "
tr	3	We 'll get to the coast and find a ship .
tr	0	" That 's none of your affair , " he snapped .
tr	2	I 'm not going to harm you . "
tr	1	I 'll spit you like a roast pig ! "
tr	1	She knew he was as quick and ferocious as a tigress .
tr	1	" Blast your soul , you hustler ! "
tr	0	" Back up the crag , quick ! "
tr	2	" How long do you suppose she 'll crouch there ? "
tr	4	Valerian looked at her blankly , his resentment forgotten .
tr	2	But the prospect now confronting his congealed his blood .
tr	0	Anyway , she can 't climb this crag . "
tr	3	The branches that touch the crag down there are too light .
tr	4	" We need not starve , " he said .
tr	4	" There is fruit we can reach . "
tr	0	" Who 'd have thought to find a city here ?
tr	2	Could black people build a city like that ?
tr	3	And they might not , if they could .
tr	1	She had also cut several strands of tough , thin vine .
tr	0	But we always fight by clans and tribes . "
tr	3	And it had its effect on the monster .
tr	2	" She 's making for the pool ! "
tr	3	" Mitra , grant that the wind blow not ! "
tr	0	His face was a pallid oval in the gloom .
tr	1	Valerian bit his lip to check a cry .
tr	4	Behind them the forest was a black impenetrable ocean of shadows .
tr	1	Out of the south a wind had sprung up .
tr	4	It blew over them directly into the black forest behind them .
tr	1	Not a leaf stirred , nor a bird chirped .
tr	3	But nothing disturbed the silence of the thickets .
tr	3	No use coming to their gates in the night .
tr	2	" Suppose a dragon comes out of the woods ? "
tr	0	She was staring at the city , a few miles away .
tr	2	Not a light shone from spire or tower .
tr	2	She did not reply nor look toward him .
tr	4	You pirates aren 't used to horseback . "
tr	4	My ears keep watch while my eyes sleep . "
tr	1	inquired the boy , half in derision and half in fascination .
tr	4	" But I 've dreamed of being even that .
tr	3	But look : once this plain was cultivated . "
tr	4	Let 's go in and explore a bit . "
tr	4	The walls were of a shiny green material .
tr	3	" That 's what the people of Punt call them .
tr	4	They glow like a cat 's eyes in the dark .
tr	4	Maybe it became haunted , and everybody got up and left .
tr	4	" I never saw people exactly like them .
tr	1	he asked , masking his keen curiosity with derision .
tr	2	Let 's have a look through that door over there . "
tr	0	" You have a look , " advised Valerian .
tr	3	She was built with an economy that was almost repellent .
tr	4	The woman he had seen was still in the chamber .
tr	0	Her face was an ashy mask of fear .
tr	0	Valerian realized that it was not fear alone that paralyzed her .
tr	0	Valerian acted according to the first impulse of his wayward nature .
tr	0	It was but a woman beneath it , after all !
tr	1	" You mean to say this city is inhabited ? "
tr	4	" The quarter by the western gate ! "
tr	1	It seemed to possess some sort of life of its own .
tr	0	Its jaws yawned at his and snapped together .
tr	3	" But I can 't go , " he protested .
tr	2	She could not long keep up that flailing whirlwind .
tr	2	He had forgotten the wounded woman on the floor .
tr	0	Valerian wrenched and tore savagely , but in vain .
tr	4	" What the devil 's going on here ? "
tr	2	These halls may be full of lurking devils .
tr	4	" Perhaps they are your friends , " suggested Valerian .
tr	0	Neither made as much noise as a cat would have made .
tr	2	It rolled across the floor with an appalling clatter .
tr	2	" I told you the halls were full of them . "
tr	2	" Why don 't they open the door ? "
tr	2	" What about those fellows who were following us ?
tr	3	Won 't they try to storm that door ? "
tr	2	We would not restrain you against your will .
tr	1	" This man is Olmec , " she said .
tr	1	But an invitation to eat and drink never found her backward .
tr	2	" I have read the books of our mothers .
tr	3	It was trying to gobble us up . "
tr	1	Their swords broke like twigs against their scales ! "
tr	3	The central part of the city was left bare and uninhabited .
tr	2	You are professional fighters -- why not fight for us ?
tr	0	Do not fear ; naught can harm you here . "
tr	0	With the realization came anger and instant action .
tr	2	Valerian cast his from his to sprawl on the floor .
tr	1	Fear and revulsion of this weird city swept him .
tr	2	" Do you fear someone will hear you ?
tr	3	That must be the door that hed to the catacombs .
tr	0	The captives we will burn and flay and quarter . "
tr	3	Will it not seem strange to have no foe to fight ?
tr	1	His sword was like a living thing in his hand .
tr	4	" You look like a butcher yourself , " he laughed .
tr	0	She shook a red shower from her hands .
tr	3	But that calf ought to be bandaged . "
tr	0	Oh , for a captive to flay alive !
tr	2	Yet it is good to look upon their dead faces .
tr	1	The fire of fighting still burned brightly in his soul .
tr	4	These might have come on a raid of their own . "
tr	3	In a little while that leg will be getting stiff . "
tr	4	But only their quick , hurried breathing disturbed the silence .
tr	4	And there beyond them is my sister 's eldest son ! "
tr	4	She did not take her eyes from the heads .
tr	2	" Any word you want to send to your people ? "
tr	0	This whole affair had an aspect of lunacy .
tr	4	For a dozen years there has been only one dragon .
tr	4	Presently she was glaring through a doorway upon a weird scene .
tr	3	It availed his nothing against her brute strength .
tr	1	For the first time in fifty years it is unguarded .
tr	1	We shall spend our lives in drinking and love-making .
tr	4	New experiences were flooding Valerian 's proud soul that night .
tr	1	Her mouth gaped , but no sound issued .
tr	1	I think it will be quite convenient now . "
tr	2	" You shall restore the youth of Olmec .
tr	2	Valerian 's tongue clove to the roof of his mouth .
tr	4	It was the burning , hypnotic , terrible eyes of Olmec .
tr	3	" What the devil are you doing on that thing ? "
tr	2	" Do you think I care what happens to you ?
tr	1	Words came in a rush from the captive 's ashy lips .
tr	2	A knife thrown from behind will do the work .
tr	1	She pushed past the princess and started down the stair .
tr	4	The impact would have snapped the vertebrae of a lesser woman .
tr	3	But this did not affect her ferocity to any appreciable extent .
tr	1	Every door in this chamber is guarded by such traps .
tr	4	He paused beside the altar and spoke in the tense stillness .
tr	0	The skin was not like that of a normal human .
tr	0	And have you found it at last ? "
tr	0	She was not mad , as a woman is amd .
tr	1	It 's dawn , outside this infernal city .
tr	0	Ice monsters and an ancient , beautiful evil await .
tr	0	Cover image : " Who Shall Be Captain ? "
tr	0	The cop hung his slicker by the door .
tr	2	Angelina still loves him , you know . "
tr	1	Lucas tried hailing him a few more times before giving up .
tr	2	We 'll see you boys on Monday . "
tr	1	Tomlinson stepped out of his cruiser as Lucas came screeching alongside .
tr	0	" The Rump 's an island again , " he said .
tr	3	There 's nothing ' great ' about him at all . "
tr	0	" Going for a walk , " he said .
tr	3	" Button up , " his mother said .
tr	0	" Can 't have you catching cold . "
tr	0	" And stay away from the water ! "
tr	1	Chris picked it up and threw it again .
tr	2	But let 's take a closer look , shall we ? "
tr	1	" And obviously , most of it is still buried .
tr	0	" Care to give us a hand ? "
tr	4	Chris asked , peering over the professor 's shoulder .
tr	0	" Could be any of a thousand , " he began .
tr	1	It wasn 't every day you stumbled across a shipwreck .
tr	2	" Is this sort of thing common ? "
tr	1	" It 's gon na get worse , " Haskins shouted .
tr	3	After that will come the scientists and marine archeologists .
tr	4	Thing like this doesn 't happen every day . "
tr	1	Haskins asked Lucas to move the crowds back .
tr	3	" Most important thing right now is to keep it intact .
tr	1	Lucas introduced him to the Park Service historian .
tr	0	He looked at his watch and did the math .
tr	0	He put that out of his mind while approaching the house .
tr	3	The story got heavy play those first few days .
tr	4	Then , he remembered something he 'd seen on TV .
tr	0	" You 're exactly right , my young friend ! "
tr	3	But he knew there was more to it than that .
tr	3	Or maybe it was more formal than that , Chris thought .
tr	2	An expensive looking microscope was off to one side .
tr	3	But you and I know it better as chicken .
tr	1	" Known to us as the Norwegian Rat . "
tr	2	But then , Chris couldn 't really blame him .
tr	3	But the other side of the hull was remarkably intact .
tr	4	They 'd row the last few hundred yards , Chris realized .
tr	1	Smiling , Chris scratched behind its ear and got to work .
tr	3	After a nervous moment , it caught with a smoky hiss .
tr	1	More importantly , Chris saw the fireworks were doing their job .
tr	0	He turned on the flashlight , then flicked his lighter .
tr	4	Whatever it had been , it was gone now .
tr	3	It took him another moment to realize it wasn 't him .
tr	2	Course you already know that from reading my book .
tr	2	You have read my book , haven 't you ?
tr	2	Seth had only skimmed it and hoped to do no more .
tr	0	Hell , I already make lamps and sofas and beds .
tr	4	Makes sense to buy the stores that sell ' em .
tr	2	And your stores in particular have lots of growth opportunity .
tr	1	Never had anyone turn down a billion dollars before .
tr	3	No , I 'm not , Seth thought .
tr	4	Still , it was expensive for Seth to keep up appearances .
tr	3	But Seth couldn 't say no to either of them .
tr	2	After that , you 're on your own .
tr	3	Important to strike while the iron 's hot .
tr	2	Seth 's mouth moved , but no sound came out .
tr	3	Anyway , time to get back to work ! "
tr	3	He stayed up a long while after that thinking .
tr	3	It all added up to the same thing .
tr	1	It looked like his heart was no longer in it .
tr	2	The man then turned toward the dog and crouched down .
tr	0	But all of that was at least a month away .
tr	0	Wind an ' rain an ' heavy seas .
tr	3	He just hoped that someday was other than today .
tr	0	He had a small nose and wide lips .
tr	0	It might also help keep away any late-night gawkers .
tr	2	" Look , " Chris said , motioning to the man .
tr	4	His voice echoed around the metal box as he spoke .
tr	3	Starting from the bottom , Chris worked his way up .
tr	1	" An ' anyway , " the man continued .
tr	4	Get quit of me sea legs , as it were . "
tr	4	Like the rest of the congregants , his eyes were closed .
tr	1	" Now , now , " he began .
tr	4	It seemed like the whole town had come to services .
tr	0	" Ya scurry faster than a hunted rabbit .
tr	1	" Anyway , " the man went on .
tr	4	Chris turned away , embarrassed by the man 's effusive introduction .
tr	4	It really had been one hell of a show .
tr	2	He looked away so as not to betray himself .
tr	0	" Hard to say , " he began .
tr	4	Throw in teenagers and beer and maybe that fueled the vandalism .
tr	4	When he was gone , Cobb turned to the ranger .
tr	1	Chris asked , raising his head to glance at the professor .
tr	3	But now ... " Cobb turned toward the wreck .
tr	0	" Has the carbon dating come back yet ? "
tr	3	" I suspect they 'll do exactly that . "
tr	3	It took Chris a moment to realize it was a question .
tr	1	" His name 's Professor Cobb , " Chris answered .
tr	1	" No , he 's not , " Chris said .
tr	4	But believe me , laddie , ' tis more than that .
tr	4	It was certainly true that Cobb was here every day .
tr	1	But Chris knew it was kind of his hobby .
tr	3	Anyway , he 'd have to think about that another time .
tr	2	" You go on home , boy , " he said .
tr	1	With that , Chris turned and began sliding down the dune .
tr	3	His voice went soft on that last part .
tr	3	But Barney didn 't allow it to linger .
tr	4	It made his own head want to explode .
tr	1	A short man , he wore round eyeglasses and ill-fitting suits .
tr	0	His pale mustache was almost invisible against his paler face .
tr	3	It was as if he 'd lost interest in most everything .
tr	3	Chris thought about that and knew Barney was right .
tr	0	" Thanks , Barney , " he said .
tr	3	" You just think about that , " he said .
tr	3	But Chris wasn 't here to talk about immigration .
tr	3	" Pretty cool , isn 't it ? "
tr	2	Chris asked , looking up from his open book test .
tr	3	I have no doubt they 'll take it .
tr	1	Maybe have bamboo shoots stuck up his fingernails .
tr	0	And all appeared well down at the marina .
tr	3	Lucas couldn 't wait to see how things turned out .
tr	0	He quickly turned around again and swerved back onto the road .
tr	1	Not to mention her annoying habit of creeping up on him .
tr	4	If nothing else , he was always polite .
tr	0	Like Vasa , the Mary Rose was a warship .
tr	2	The Mary Rose too was now in her own museum .
tr	4	~ Chris turned to leave once they all came out .
tr	0	" Well ... thank ya anyway , son .
tr	1	An ' if I might give ya a word of advice ?
tr	0	Ya come across anyone a that name , stay far away .
tr	3	To a man , they all seemed to want that .
tr	1	His glasses hung from a string around his neck .
tr	2	Chris nodded before truly understanding what the man had said .
tr	2	" Well ... it 's hard to say , really .
tr	2	And of course , a lot depends on condition .
tr	1	But , " the man said , pausing before going on .
tr	1	And now , he finally knew what it meant .
tr	1	" I 'll be out in a minute . "
tr	2	Chris opened his bag and took out two sandwiches .
tr	0	Alas , it wasn 't meant ta be . "
tr	3	He went quiet after that , staring out to sea .
tr	4	After another few moments , he went on .
tr	0	An ' I canna say I blame them .
tr	2	" About the professor , " Chris went on .
tr	2	" So what are you going to do about it ? "
tr	2	Turning , he looked back out to sea .
tr	4	" These be fer yer time an ' yer trouble . "
tr	0	Chris stared at them and shook his head .
tr	1	An ' a paltry sum it is fer yer kindness .
tr	1	Smiling , he said , " Help you with something ? "
tr	3	Tie 's probably too tight , he thought .
tr	0	" Just making a joke , is all .
tr	1	He took off his jacket and laid it by his side .
tr	0	" Had a busy day the other day .
tr	0	You know , first day of the barge and all .
tr	2	And you keep your eyes open too , okay ? "
tr	0	" And again , I 'm sorry about that .
tr	2	" It 's all right , " he answered grudgingly .
tr	3	He set that thought aside and sat down himself .
tr	2	" You look good , " she said .
tr	1	" It 's hemp , " she said .
tr	0	Which should be legal , by the way .
tr	2	Did you know this country was built on hemp ?
tr	4	" That 's the way most people feel .
tr	2	Did you know I used to have a crush on you ?
tr	0	He had to admit it was a nice one .
tr	2	" Got a couple of guests coming this afternoon . "
tr	3	~ But Chris didn 't go home straight away .
tr	2	Much of the lower hull was still intact .
tr	1	Seeing who it was , Chris stood up .
tr	1	Probably still has his sea legs , Chris thought .
tr	0	" Just wan na talk , is all .
tr	1	Chris waited for him to raise his head and look up .
tr	1	" Don 't worry , " Chris replied .
tr	2	" What do you want to know ? "
tr	2	" Well ... mutiny is what other folks 'd call it .
tr	3	The two went quiet for a while after that .
tr	3	" What did you think about all this ? "
tr	3	" The crew wanted to hang the old captain .
tr	4	Said he had at least earned the right to be heard .
tr	2	Knocked me on my bottom , it did .
tr	3	" That 's alright , " he said gently .
tr	2	" Were you following me this morning ? "
tr	0	Chris glanced down and saw what Marcus had been staring at .
tr	2	To Chris , their outfits now looked less ridiculous somehow .
tr	3	Its other was tied around the captain 's neck .
tr	2	He was going out on his own terms .
tr	1	Only then did Chris realize it was Billy who had spoken .
tr	0	Chris turned and saw Sarah gazing around the room .
tr	4	All except Sykes , that is , who continued his leer .
tr	1	Chris almost smiled to see Sykes leg was still uplifted .
tr	3	Thing must be getting awfully tired , he thought .
tr	1	Sykes asked with venom , staring him down .
tr	1	So it surprised him to see Sykes smile .
tr	1	Not an angry smile , but a sincere one .
tr	1	Chris saw a muscle in Sykes ' leg move .
tr	2	" I mean ... point of order ! "
tr	4	Even Sykes turned to throw a malevolent glare his way .
tr	0	Staring straight at Sykes , Chris went ahead anyway .
tr	4	Still , it seemed to hit a nerve .
tr	4	He watched the men slowly turn to each other .
tr	3	Tell them what prize you were after on that trip .
tr	3	He thought for a moment he might faint from the tension .
tr	1	" It 's LIES I 'm tellin ' ya ! "
tr	3	There ain 't an ounce of truth in it ! "
tr	2	Looking up , he glanced around the room before concluding .
tr	3	Chris had yet to figure that one out .
tr	1	He had his arms crossed and his eyes closed .
tr	0	" By the way , you did really good !
tr	4	I 'm surprised there aren 't more people , though .
tr	3	But I guess that 's another sign of the times .
tr	4	Anyway , it looked like the deliberations were almost over .
tr	4	They stood and clapped each other on the back .
tr	3	He wasn 't at all sure how he felt about that .
tr	0	~ It had already been a long day .
tr	4	All the rooms but one were filled this evening .
tr	2	Chris rolled his eyes , but couldn 't help smiling .
tr	3	It was the captain 's turn to smile .
tr	1	" He plans on takin ' me ship .
tr	2	Don ' know quite how he 's gon na do it .
tr	1	But he plans on takin ' me ship . "
tr	0	" An ' I canna let that happen , boy .
tr	3	" Pretty thing , isn 't it ? "
tr	3	After thinking about it for a moment , Chris nodded .
tr	3	But still ... " The captain went quiet .
tr	3	The captain stopped too , looking back to stare with curiosity .
tr	0	Chris was thinking about what the captain had just said .
tr	2	Only one or two umbrellas still dotted the landscape .
tr	0	But oh , he thought , if they only knew !
tr	3	He 'd already put two and two together .
tr	2	Chris nodded and made his way toward the stairs .
tr	3	" Got ta go write up a report on this .
tr	3	Annie 's Variety has just about the best in town . "
tr	1	She was waiting for him to lose it .
tr	3	To his credit , he was getting better at it .
tr	3	To the untrained eye , they fit right in .
tr	0	He also caught a glimpse of Arthur Cobb .
tr	1	But wild animals should remain in the wild . "
tr	4	" Their social groups are called harems , " he began .
tr	1	" Look closely at their stripes , " Chris said .
tr	3	That 's how they tell each other apart .
tr	3	But the truth is , their territory has shrunk to nothing .
tr	2	He keeps a couple of zoologists on staff too .
tr	2	He 's just trying to do good . "
tr	0	" Typical , " Sarah said , then watched Chris smile .
tr	2	You seem to know a lot about them . "
tr	3	That 's about it , " Chris answered .
tr	2	Come on , let me show you his digs .
tr	3	He 's got the nicest apartment on the Rump . "
tr	0	Sarah was aghast to see the chimp chain smoking cigarettes .
tr	0	" It 's a Sunday , the day before Labor Day .
tr	2	But he could think of no other way .
tr	2	Chris took a moment before saying it out loud .
tr	0	Barney said , " That 's not a problem .
tr	4	A quick whistle from the bartender made them turn their heads .
tr	4	When they all saw the time , they scattered .
tr	4	Only the bartender glanced up from his People magazine and smiled .
tr	3	" What 's the word today , Luke ? "
tr	1	" Went out this morning , " Clem Johnson answered .
tr	1	I think it might be Blake 's . "
tr	4	~ Chris descended the stairway from Dale Duesenberg 's studio .
tr	1	Today , Dale had him working on drip paintings .
tr	3	" That 's the point , my boy .
tr	2	" My , my , laddie , " he said .
tr	4	The two began walking together , the dog scampering along behind .
tr	1	First , there was that business of the vandalism .
tr	3	But that was crazy too , wasn 't it ?
tr	4	Americans were obsessed with just ... leaving things alone .
tr	0	For he was certain that that was exactly what had happened .
tr	1	One or two had difficulty lying to their wives .
tr	0	It was all on the up and up .
tr	0	The old man was healthy as a horse .
tr	2	You just never know what fate has in store for you .
tr	4	His body language suggested he couldn 't believe his eyes .
tr	1	" Swords and foils and sheaths and stuff like that .
tr	2	" Hey , you know what they look like ? "
tr	0	The manager had already gone back to looking at the video .
tr	3	The truth was , he still couldn 't quite believe it .
tr	0	So he looked at her and said it again .
tr	1	The men had taken brass fittings and spikes and fasteners .
tr	1	It was almost as brazen as his own scheme .
tr	4	Of course , that didn 't make any sense either .
tr	4	He felt sure he could smoke out whoever it was .
tr	1	Don 't want my own hygiene to derail the plan .
tr	2	" Hello , is this Brad Cullen ? "
tr	0	It does seem to have washed away again .
tr	0	Chris turned away , embarrassed by it as usual .
tr	0	He saw Sarah on a blanket to his right .
tr	0	Chris turned and headed for Sarah 's blanket .
tr	2	She took a moment to compose her question .
tr	0	In answer to Sarah , he turned and shrugged again .
tr	4	" Who ever knows what they 're up to ? "
tr	0	No , he was certain now that 's what was happening .
tr	1	Nothing he could really put his finger on , mind you .
tr	2	he asked , motioning to the food vendors .
tr	1	Says he 's real busy with something . "
tr	2	Chris nodded , knowing full well what Billy was busy with .
tr	0	A crash of cymbals signaled the parade was underway .
tr	4	The billowing sails were made of sheets of green sod .
tr	0	When he stood up again , Chris couldn 't help himself .
tr	3	It wasn 't something the always assured Pickett normally did .
tr	1	" Just surprised Barney went along , is all .
tr	4	Tell me , how did he vote ? "
tr	2	" It 's in my book , son .
tr	1	Nothing was going to dampen his happiness on this day .
tr	1	It would be his first visit to Barney 's in weeks .
tr	3	" Now , they think it might be sexual .
tr	1	" Kinky , " Sarah said , smiling .
tr	3	It was Chris 's turn to swat her on the arm .
tr	1	Then again , with him , anything was possible .
tr	2	" The one I told you about ? "
tr	0	They began making their way across the gangway toward the ship .
tr	0	A man standing nearby waited for the basket .
tr	1	When it was filled , he ran off with it .
tr	1	Beyond that sat women at long tables running sewing machines .
tr	1	Upon seeing Chris , Bill winked and smiled .
tr	4	This one had an edge of cruelty in it .
tr	3	Don 't want to get in the way . "
tr	3	Lucas knew that , but tried not to let it show .
tr	0	First , it was Susan B. Anthony , then Sacagawea .
tr	4	Now , they 've got that presidents series .
tr	4	Got a James K. Polk recently handed to me as change .
tr	0	But he said he got the coin from his grandfather . "
tr	1	" Said it was ... William ... no .
tr	2	Lucas wrote down the name and closed his notebook .
tr	2	Don 't you wan na know more about the coin ? "
tr	1	Being passed off as dollars on the Rump .
tr	0	Hell , maybe grandpa was in on it too .
tr	0	Turning around , he saw it was Sarah .
tr	2	I used to follow you around all the time . "
tr	4	She smiled and went back to her sandwich .
tr	1	Living on the Rump , isolated like this .
tr	3	It 's just ... usually I do most of the talking .
tr	3	And I 'd listen if you want to talk . "
tr	0	" I mean , I am capable of it . "
tr	4	But lem me see , your first question was ... ? "
tr	1	" Living on the Rump , " she said .
tr	3	But there 's a flip side to that too .
tr	1	Did you know before it was Unitarian it was Catholic ?
tr	3	It 's kind of cool , stuff like that .
tr	2	" Now , home schooling , " he said .
tr	1	Turning to Sarah , he saw she was smiling .
tr	4	Might be the best part of living here .
tr	4	Plus , the tutors I have are awesome .
tr	4	Sometimes , I forget what he looks like .
tr	1	Funny thing though , I still remember his voice .
tr	3	Not that there was anything special about it .
tr	3	" Didn 't mean for that to happen .
tr	2	But you did ask , and I answered . "
tr	2	" Your boyfriend got some sand in an uncomfortable place . "
tr	4	But a strange thing happened when the final beam fell .
tr	1	Smiling , he turned to Sarah and pointed .
tr	3	" They wouldn 't do that , " he thought .
tr	3	" They ... just wouldn 't do that . "
tr	1	Perhaps this was even a blessing in disguise .
tr	1	~ " Anyone know anything about this ? "
tr	4	Lucas asked , studying every face for clues .
tr	1	Worry about work or where their next paycheck was coming from .
tr	1	That is , he supposed , unless the price was right .
tr	4	On the left , he recognized the young Duggan kid .
tr	3	They just didn 't have it in them .
tr	0	And it wasn 't an act of vandalism .
tr	0	Poor man , he was taking it very hard .
tr	1	" You notice anything else unusual going on around here ? "
tr	3	There was that little matter of the offering , though .
tr	0	~ Unofficially anyway , summer was coming to a close .
tr	0	After a brief water war , a truce was called .
tr	1	From behind , Chris heard a motorcycle start up .
tr	1	Smiling , Chris asked about the ship 's progress .
tr	0	" Jes say what ye hafta say , laddie .
tr	0	Anyway , Chris had done all he could .
tr	2	" How 'd ya know I was lyin ' ? "
tr	1	Ye said I was lyin ' , and you were right .
tr	4	He said Sykes had already taken control and you were below .
tr	3	" It 's my turn to ask you something . "
tr	2	Silly now , lookin ' back on it .
tr	3	But it was the only thing I could do . "
tr	0	Chris told him where he could find them .
tr	4	There was no need for larger vessels for this haul .
tr	0	He figured now was as good a time as any .
tr	2	" I 'm not stupid , you know .
tr	2	I wouldn 't dream of going without you . "
tr	1	He ran through the list again and could find nothing .
tr	4	Before he could , he felt another , and then another .
tr	2	The sharp ends of the swords followed him down .
tr	2	" You , " one of them said .
tr	3	But this was not what he 'd expected .
tr	0	" Now , I made a promise not ta kill ya .
tr	0	" An ' so , I 'll ask again .
tr	2	" Back room , " Arthur choked out .
tr	3	No time to dwell on that now , he thought .
tr	0	he said to Sarah , grabbing her hand .
tr	0	" Anyway , young lad an ' lassie .
tr	0	He caught Sarah smiling as if she already knew .
tr	0	" Hang yer ass out an let fly ! "
tr	0	There was a many days growth of beard on his face .
tr	1	" They plan on leavin ' this place soon .
tr	1	~ " You can 't be serious , " Chris said .
tr	3	" But ... but ... " Chris stammered .
tr	3	Maybe then they 'd think twice about any drastic changes .
tr	3	Nothing at all could detract from this wonderful day .
tr	1	Suppressing his sigh , he glanced at his watch .
tr	1	Only a few more minutes until the contract signing ceremony .
tr	2	~ Sunlight poured through the open boathouse door .
tr	2	From outside the boathouse came the sound of outboard motors .
tr	0	It was the Lady Grace that was moving .
tr	4	It began to feel as if they were flying .
tr	3	Probably just a trick of the sea , he thought .
tr	4	Seth still marveled at the fact he 'd come alone .
tr	3	One look from the captain put a stop to all that .
tr	0	It was Chris who had done all the changing .
tr	0	But the captain appeared to have no doubts at all .
tr	4	Their captain looked down at the elegant and well-dressed Barney .
tr	0	Seth had even caught him glancing at his watch .
tr	3	He 'd left all that to the lawyers .
tr	0	" Hey , Seth , " Barney said dryly .
tr	3	Glad to see it ain 't so . "
tr	4	Another round of applause and some scattered whistles broke out .
tr	4	His father had been slipping off the deep end for years .
tr	1	" You know it is , Barney , " Pickett said .
tr	3	Setting that contract aside , he picked up the next .
tr	2	" We usually do , " Calvin replied .
tr	3	But we 've got plenty of time to fix that . "
tr	0	Certainly , our family will have a very good payday today .
tr	0	The lawyers put that in place years ago .
tr	1	Barney signed his name to the seventh contract and went on .
tr	1	Barney signed the last contract and lay the pen down .
tr	0	Barney smiled and leaned back in his chair .
tr	0	He smiled as he approached Sarah and Chris .
tr	4	His eyes were far away while he scanned the horizon .
tr	4	" I 'm not really sure , " he answered .
tr	1	Chris smiled again to see pirate democracy in action .
tr	0	" Goes both ways , Captain , " he said .
tr	1	Officer Lucas was there , though that was no surprise .
tr	3	Chris still hadn 't figured out that one yet .
tr	1	Chris heard a familiar voice come from behind .
tr	1	Haskins froze , finally understanding where this was all going .
tr	2	And we have lawyers too , you know . "
tr	1	While Chris had been thinking those things , his mind drifted .
tr	3	At least ... that was me story . "
tr	4	His booted men began shuffling across the deck toward the ladder .
tr	0	It was a bag of some sort , and heavy .
tr	2	" You 're not doing your job ! "
tr	2	She took a moment to pose her question .
tr	3	" I wouldn 't worry about that , " he said .
tr	1	It simply wasn 't possible to go back in time .
tr	3	They heard soft footsteps approach through the mist .
tr	3	Chris thought it might be Barney coming to join them .
tr	4	He came over and joined them on the rail .
tr	0	She was about fifty yards away now , sailing true .
tr	0	A hand reached up and began rubbing his back .
tr	4	" He 's made arrangements for you , " he began .
tr	2	Barney has big plans for it , all well laid out .
tr	3	Ultimately , the directorship if you want it .
tr	0	He always watched you around the animals , you know .
tr	0	" What was Cobb 's beef with Barney anyway ? "
tr	2	" Cobb was on the zoning board years ago .
tr	1	" Cobb 's books , " Dawkins answered .
tr	0	Sarah returned his smile and pulled her hand away .
tr	1	Chris saw him raise his hand and begin waving it .
tr	0	Reaching out , Chris caught the surprisingly heavy thing .
tr	3	Cobb had continued his nattering throughout their voyage .
tr	3	But that didn 't look like it was happening anytime soon .
tr	0	After all , what harm had been done ?
tr	0	He took one last glance at the -- Panamanian ?
tr	1	But in his sleep , Chris smiled to hear it .
tr	1	Once again and most sincerely , thanks for reading .
tr	4	Don 't you believe it ... Meet Jill .
tr	4	I was not sure what I was expecting to see .
tr	1	' Yo , ' said a tired voice .
tr	3	He grunted indistinct words and struck a match .
tr	2	' That 's going to kill you one day . '
tr	4	' He wasn 't happy to see me . '
tr	2	So , two more to go , ' he murmured .
tr	2	' Did you do something to piss him off ? '
tr	2	' You mean , he 's one of you ? '
tr	4	We were happy and I never wanted for anything .
tr	4	I watched them kill my mother seventeen times .
tr	0	Thus , Death as an ultimate end was unavoidable .
tr	2	And then the crows come for most of us .
tr	2	Rain pounded the roof of the Monte Carlo .
tr	2	' Will he try to kill you again ? '
tr	0	' The address Haus gave you was a dead end .
tr	0	' Hunters normally work as a pack . '
tr	2	' And how do you intend to kill him ? '
tr	1	' You 're a first class shot . '
tr	4	' Where do you propose I keep it ?
tr	3	Things started to go wrong when the Feds got involved .
tr	0	' Doorman said he arrived two days ago .
tr	4	Reid manoeuvred the Chevrolet into peak time traffic .
tr	2	We drove through a series of increasingly rundown neighbourhoods .
tr	0	Haus stepped out and stood watching as the car drew away .
tr	0	' I thought you said he had a sword . '
tr	2	He frowned and took the Glock out of his holster .
tr	1	' It kinda reminds me of that Jack Nicholson movie . '
tr	4	" ' One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest ? " '
tr	1	' No , " The Shining " , ' said Reid .
tr	3	It brought with it a range of smells .
tr	1	The rank odour of oil from a nearby refinery .
tr	0	The chemical stink of the tannery half a mile away .
tr	3	' I 'm pretty sure it 's the latter . '
tr	1	Neither Order forbade their Hunters from playing with their prey .
tr	2	Without warning , a section of the roof collapsed beneath us .
tr	4	The deafening noise of the semi-automatic filled the confined space .
tr	3	It was two hours before I got back to the apartment .
tr	1	Night had long since fallen across the city .
tr	2	I touched an ordinary looking section of the cool white stone .
tr	3	The basement was off limits to the other tenants .
tr	1	The idea was so ridiculous I discarded it straight away .
tr	3	He probably thought it was poetic justice or something .
tr	0	The giant was a much taller and wider version of Haus .
tr	1	Muscles bulged across his shoulders and rippled under his tailored trousers .
tr	1	' Finish him , Abel , ' he said coldly .
tr	4	I muttered wryly as I rose to my feet .
tr	3	The gun and the sword clattered out of his grip .
tr	1	We were in our office in Mission Hill .
tr	1	Bar some bird droppings , the car had remained miraculously untouched .
tr	3	' I particularly want to meet with Mr Soul .
tr	0	' Any chance Haus knew him from way back then ? '
tr	0	he said finally , his gaze steady on my face .
tr	0	' So , what are you saying ? '
tr	1	' I think he might still be alive . '
tr	3	' Was it to get to you ? '
tr	2	' You just don 't like cats , do you ? '
tr	0	' I do hope nothing bad has happened to him . '
tr	2	The colour had faded in most of them .
tr	2	' Would you like something to drink ? '
tr	1	' This is a recent picture of him . '
tr	1	I frowned faintly ; I suspected that my partner was grinning .
tr	4	The cat rose on its legs and watched me warily .
tr	4	I shifted and studied the dim passage beneath me .
tr	3	' You might as well get to the point .
tr	0	' And what exactly did Haus say ? '
tr	0	The strays had scattered and were rapidly disappearing down the alleyway .
tr	2	Heat bloomed on the back of my hand .
tr	2	I gripped him tightly and dodged a further spray of bullets .
tr	3	' Get to the north entrance of the park .
tr	4	A narrow , gloomy stairwell opened up beneath me .
tr	3	I turned and started swiftly down the steps .
tr	4	I emerged in a narrow passage between two buildings .
tr	4	A squeal of tires shattered the relative silence behind me .
tr	1	I shouted , waving wildly with my free hand .
tr	0	' What the hell 's going on ? '
tr	2	It had proven useful on many of our previous investigations .
tr	4	Have responded to the disturbance at Golden Leaf .
tr	4	Despite these flagrant discrepancies , they made a good team .
tr	1	said Meyer , frowning at the notepad in his hand .
tr	3	' I wanted to ask them about the cat . '
tr	3	Pratt 's gaze shifted to the furry bundle on my lap .
tr	3	' That 's correct , ' I answered truthfully .
tr	2	' Does this kind of thing happen to you often ? '
tr	4	I pretended ignorance and gazed at him steadily .
tr	2	' That 'll be all for today , Mr Soul .
tr	0	The beam from the Chevy 's headlights washed across the asphalt .
tr	3	' What are you intending to do with that ? '
tr	3	' I don 't know the answer to that either . '
tr	1	And if I was right , things would only get worse .
tr	3	I didn 't exactly get time to ask them questions . '
tr	1	I sighed , the smile leaving my lips .
tr	3	I stared out of the window , stalling for time .
tr	2	A low rumble of approval erupted from its belly .
tr	1	' I 'm coming with you , ' he grunted .
tr	1	' This will get ugly , ' I said quietly .
tr	1	' Price can wait , ' Reid retorted dismissively .
tr	0	' What 's wrong with the Chevy ? '
tr	4	' How many of them are there ? '
tr	3	The cat sauntered across the floor to investigate .
tr	3	I stared at the contents of the crate .
tr	2	' Do you hold a license for the guns ? '
tr	0	' How long have you had these ? '
tr	0	' I 've already given Bergman and Sacks your details . '
tr	2	' Life as an immortal would be tedious without one . '
tr	1	' This is quite a collection , ' he said dully .
tr	1	' This is for taking care of him . '
tr	0	' Not anymore than usual , ' I said drily .
tr	3	' This is a lotta cake , ' he stated dully .
tr	0	We moved past him and headed down a dimly-lit spiral staircase .
tr	1	He finished polishing a wine glass and turned around slowly .
tr	4	' Yes , ' I said , carefully avoiding her eyes .
tr	2	' Does that mean you knew Olsson ? '
tr	0	The older man paused and looked at us quizzically .
tr	4	' The Second Council is the Assembly , ' Solange continued .
tr	0	I stared at a name and an address .
tr	1	It 's been so long since we last saw you . '
tr	2	Solange crossed the room and stopped in front of me .
tr	1	A sad smile flitted across Solange 's face .
tr	2	Even more puzzling was how Olsson fitted into any of it .
tr	4	' Well , we won 't get anywhere just sitting here .
tr	1	' This guy is as clean as a whistle .
tr	1	His lips were parted in a cold , artificial smile .
tr	3	I stared at the blueprints on the table .
tr	2	' So , what 's our next move ? '
tr	3	It took us eight minutes to disable it .
tr	3	Reid set about investigating the contents of the bookcases and cabinets .
tr	3	I turned my attention to the computer on the desk .
tr	4	he muttered , watching my fingers fly across the keyboard .
tr	2	' Do you think he 'll notice ? '
tr	2	' It 's worth about half a million dollars . '
tr	4	' This the person they 're after ? '
tr	2	The blades shuddered in my hands , blocking round after round .
tr	3	My feet unconsciously shifted into the basic starting stance of kendo .
tr	4	Reid finally muttered while he negotiated the evening traffic .
tr	3	' Tell me it wasn 't you guys ? '
tr	1	Voices and music echoed faintly in the background behind him .
tr	2	' No doubt they 'll call us in . '
tr	2	' And we might as well tell you now .
tr	3	I glanced at the toys that littered the passageway .
tr	1	' For my sins , ' grumbled the old man .
tr	0	' I already have a passport , ' he said .
tr	1	' Money 's not an issue , ' I said briskly .
tr	3	' Day after tomorrow , at the earliest . '
tr	1	' Like I said , money isn 't an issue . '
tr	2	' What do you want to know ? '
tr	2	... No , commercial flights are out of the question .
tr	1	' I 'm Jim , your pilot . '
tr	2	French hip-hop music blasted loudly out of its open windows .
tr	4	Gustav 's eyes glinted when he spotted the roadster .
tr	4	he said once we were inside his apartment .
tr	0	He sat down in a large , padded armchair .
tr	2	' What do you do for a living ? '
tr	1	' Thank you , ' I murmured gratefully .
tr	4	Eight minutes later , we entered the suburb of Montreuil .
tr	0	' Wan na check out the last place ? '
tr	2	It took but seconds to scale the wooden palisade .
tr	2	A glass of rancid orange juice stood forlornly on the countertop .
tr	4	Dotted around the apartment were dozens of photo frames .
tr	2	Reid joined me and shone the torch across the floorboards .
tr	2	My fingers closed around something hard and cold .
tr	0	It was a key attached to a strip of adhesive tape .
tr	1	There was mail inside HE Strauss 's box .
tr	1	' That 's a Swiss dialling code . '
tr	1	One of the letters was from Strauss 's bank .
tr	4	said Gustav while he cleared the breakfast table .
tr	4	The Frenchman looked despondent at the news of our early departure .
tr	1	Frustratingly , the lockers were not arranged chronologically .
tr	2	Something about the door did not look quite right .
tr	2	Two aisles down , we found locker 139 .
tr	3	' This the same " A " from the postcard ? '
tr	1	' The handwriting looks similar , ' I murmured .
tr	2	A clink sounded outside the door to the locker room .
tr	1	Reid nodded , his lips tightening in a grim smile .
tr	0	' Divide and conquer is always a good plan . '
tr	4	A spray of bullets scored the ground next to the wheels .
tr	4	Reid cursed as he slammed into the door .
tr	4	I frowned and glanced at the journal by my feet .
tr	1	' You 're probably right , ' said Reid .
tr	1	' Hang on , ' I said grimly .
tr	1	A horn blared and angry words rose from the other vehicle .
tr	3	The SUVs shot out onto the asphalt behind us .
tr	4	Something pinged off the rear of the roadster .
tr	1	' I really hate shooting in the wind . '
tr	1	He grinned and slid down into the seat .
tr	4	We were already doing one hundred and twenty miles per hour .
tr	1	' No , it sure ain 't , ' said Reid .
tr	2	' So , you got any other bright ideas ? '
tr	2	I frowned and studied the layout of the road .
tr	0	' That was a bit wild , ' he said .
tr	2	Just before noon , I pulled into the town of Troyes .
tr	2	So far no information is available on its possible whereabouts . '
tr	4	Silence followed while we stared at the images on the computer .
tr	3	' But they 've got the memory stick . '
tr	4	Things were getting more dangerous by the hour .
tr	0	' Do we always look that disreputable ? '
tr	4	' Besides , they might trace the call . '
tr	4	Reid inhaled slowly and blew smoke rings towards the ceiling .
tr	4	' Come on , let 's get out of here .
tr	4	We need to find a new car . '
tr	1	' I 'm sorry , ' I said quietly .
tr	4	' We never meant to cause you any trouble . '
tr	4	said Reid once we were back on the motorway .
tr	1	' We checking out Strauss 's bank ? '
tr	2	A single cold mug of black coffee stood by the sink .
tr	4	We left the house and returned to the hotel .
tr	3	We had not had time to study it yet .
tr	2	' Not really , ' I replied reluctantly .
tr	0	Occasionally a series of exclamation marks followed a particularly complex paragraph .
tr	4	He held out a copy of a printed email .
tr	1	' Isn 't this a Swiss email address ? '
tr	0	The bank 's decor was pale and fairly clinical .
tr	2	' You had one an hour ago . '
tr	3	' What does that have to do with anything ? '
tr	0	He had a firm hand grip and smelled faintly of menthol .
tr	1	A man stood waiting for us inside the director 's office .
tr	2	They would like some information on one of our clients . '
tr	1	I glanced at Reid with a sinking feeling .
tr	3	' Want to check out the university ? '
tr	1	' Wait , ' I said , touching his arm .
tr	4	I hunched down and helped her gather the scattered folders .
tr	0	It was a woman in a white coat .
tr	2	' We 're looking for Professor Godard . '
tr	4	She glanced at the man with the dreadlocks .
tr	1	' I 'm sorry , ' she murmured after a pause .
tr	0	The man shifted awkwardly and glanced at the woman for reassurance .
tr	2	' I think she took something from Anna 's office . '
tr	2	' She 's tall , slim , with long blonde hair .
tr	1	' You thinking what I 'm thinking ? '
tr	0	' Can you make out what she 's saying ? '
tr	0	The woman in the camel coat lifted a hand and waved .
tr	4	It was the old man from the daguerreotype .
tr	1	I rolled , my heart thudding against my ribs .
tr	4	Reid called out urgently somewhere to my left .
tr	4	A series of flashes erupted on the ground behind them .
tr	1	It swerved sharply , its wing mirror grazing a lamp post .
tr	2	I saw no signs of the old man or the woman .
tr	4	' Hey , where 're you going ? '
tr	2	' I could not bear to lose both of you . '
tr	1	I was still nowhere near grasping the possible answers .
tr	0	' There 's a large population of immortals in Vienna .
tr	0	The Hauptbahnhof gunfight had already made the headlines .
tr	0	' Are immortals really that much above the law ? '
tr	2	A young woman came over to take our order .
tr	3	And what is it that you find strange , sir ? '
tr	3	' He 's not , ' he stated , matter-of-fact .
tr	4	' So , you were here during the Ottoman siege ? '
tr	1	' This is good , ' said Reid .
tr	1	' You 're right , ' I murmured .
tr	2	' No , ' he finally retorted dully .
tr	4	He pushed the frame back towards me , his face shuttered .
tr	2	' I think you should leave , ' he said coldly .
tr	3	' You don 't act like Hunters . '
tr	4	' Yes , he does , ' I murmured .
tr	0	Faint light shone through the thick lead windows .
tr	2	Lights came on behind the windows on the first floor .
tr	0	he said harshly , coming to a halt at my side .
tr	4	I closed my eyes briefly while I sifted through old memories .
tr	2	I 've had to use it on a few occasions . '
tr	1	The narrow beam barely cut through the greasy gloom around us .
tr	2	We followed it and soon arrived a junction .
tr	3	There was a soft , undeniable click after the fifth attempt .
tr	1	I paused , pressed my fingers against it and stood back .
tr	2	On the other side of it lay another corridor .
tr	2	' How the devil did you find me ? '
tr	3	The third figure sitting at the table finally stirred .
tr	2	I studied the middle-aged man who had spoken .
tr	2	His tone , though slightly accented , was old school aristocracy .
tr	4	Something flickered in the other man 's eyes .
tr	0	' I 've already said too much . '
tr	0	' I 'm afraid I must ask you to leave . '
tr	2	For a moment , we all stood frozen .
tr	2	' You two , come with me . '
tr	3	' Victor -- ' he started to say .
tr	1	shouted the woman I now knew as Anna .
tr	3	I felt my heart stutter in my chest .
tr	1	The second Hunter turned , pistol in hand .
tr	3	It struck the immortal on the shoulder just as he fired .
tr	0	' Help me , ' said Anna softly .
tr	3	A grunt of pain left the latter 's lips .
tr	2	I wiped at the trickle of blood coursing down my face .
tr	2	He pulled a cell from his coat and dialled a number .
tr	2	' Will you stop being so stubborn ? '
tr	1	Victor stiffened , his eyes going wintry with anger .
tr	3	' You two , get in the car . '
tr	2	I turned and looked out of the rear window .
tr	4	Gun muzzles appeared along the sides of the behemoth .
tr	0	An alarm sounded shrilly in the night as we sped away .
tr	0	The car shuddered and spun uncontrollably across the asphalt .
tr	0	Its tailgate finally swung around and crashed against a fire hydrant .
tr	4	We were too late to avoid the second grenade .
tr	4	The world tilted as we were flung into the air .
tr	0	I was lying at an angle against the door .
tr	2	A crimson trail oozed from the gash on his head .
tr	2	Low groans rose from the front of the car .
tr	1	I said anxiously , shifting to give him space .
tr	2	Smoke was curling up from the hood of the car .
tr	3	The resulting blast knocked us all to the ground .
tr	4	' Nope , ' muttered the Bastian driver .
tr	2	Victor 's bodyguard frowned and shook his head slowly .
tr	2	Lacroix crossed the floor and took the seat opposite mine .
tr	2	' Would you care to elaborate on that ? '
tr	1	' It 's a friendly warning , ' I said evenly .
tr	0	I sat back in the chair and forced myself to relax .
tr	2	' We went there to look for information on Strauss . '
tr	1	I studied his gaunt expression with a pang of guilt .
tr	3	' Damn , they took the cigarettes . '
tr	1	' So , you found out anything interesting ? '
tr	4	A wave of weariness suddenly washed over me .
tr	1	' Reid , ' said my partner from across the way .
tr	2	' We know who you are , ' said Bruno .
tr	1	' Give him a break , will you ?
tr	0	I stopped and stared at the man who had spoken .
tr	2	Lacroix turned and studied him from head to toe .
tr	1	Behind him , Bruno and Anatole caught my glance and tensed .
tr	1	I did not wait to see him fall .
tr	0	He gulped and passed his firearm across with a shaking hand .
tr	2	' And look what else I found . '
tr	3	He caught the one that Reid tossed at him .
tr	3	I spotted Lacroix behind a wall to the left .
tr	0	By then , I was already halfway across the floor .
tr	0	The katana hissed through the air with a silken sound .
tr	1	The tip of Olsson 's longsword missed my neck by inches .
tr	0	I moved and blocked a bullet with the katana .
tr	4	The sword shuddered in my hands when further bullets struck it .
tr	2	Olsson grinned coldly as I was slowly forced to the floor .
tr	0	A warning shot was fired above our heads .
tr	2	If we stay , all of you will die . '
tr	2	Another groaned on the floor next to him .
tr	2	He looked up in surprise at our footsteps .
tr	3	The latter cried out in shock and fell to the ground .
tr	2	Shots pinged across the hood of the Volvo .
tr	1	We crashed through the security barrier in a hail of gunfire .
tr	3	Bullets slammed into the boot of the car .
tr	0	Reid sat back in the seat and stared ahead .
tr	0	The black sedan swung around it and stayed on our tail .
tr	2	I had enough blood on my conscience as it was .
tr	2	' Not so good , ' said Bruno .
tr	2	' He 's lost a lot of blood . '
tr	2	He paused and studied the buildings outside the window .
tr	3	' I need to get in touch with Victor . '
tr	0	It 's about an hour 's walk away . '
tr	3	he muttered , staring at the half-empty bottle of liquor .
tr	4	We decided to move them to another safe house .
tr	1	That 's when you guys turned up . '
tr	1	Roman is still alive , if somewhat frail . '
tr	4	He caught the wary glance I exchanged with Reid .
tr	0	The logs crackled and hissed in the hush that followed .
tr	0	' He 's always been a bit of a pacifist . '
tr	0	' I heard that , ' mumbled Anatole .
tr	1	' Besides , that was strictly for medicinal purposes .
tr	2	' You look like hell , ' he said bluntly .
tr	2	' You don 't look so hot yourself . '
tr	1	Victor glanced at my reflection in the rear view mirror .
tr	2	' Do you know a man called Mikael Olsson ? '
tr	0	' Not that I was aware of . '
tr	3	Two miles later , the trees started to thin out .
tr	0	I studied the house through the front windshield of the van .
tr	0	He glanced warily at the woods around us .
tr	3	' And things were just starting to get interesting ! '
tr	4	I grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the trees .
tr	1	I drew the Glock and fired blindly into the night .
tr	0	Up ahead , Bruno cried out and almost fell .
tr	4	Reid raised his head slightly and peeked through the low branches .
tr	4	We were halfway across the clearing when Reid gasped and fell .
tr	1	His eyes fluttered close and he lost consciousness .
tr	4	' We meet again , half-breed , ' he said calmly .
tr	4	I pushed this troubling feeling aside and focused on his feet .
tr	4	I knew they would betray his next move .
tr	0	Already , my vision was starting to blur .
tr	2	The flow of blood from my flank doubled .
tr	0	Metal clashed against metal when our blades met a heartbeat later .
tr	0	I raised the katana and blocked the fatal blow in time .
tr	2	' You know you 're going to die , half-breed ! '
tr	4	The blade pierced my heart in a single savage blow .
tr	2	The pain and coldness that shrouded me faded .
tr	4	Then , rather unexpectedly , came the voices .
tr	3	Muted words drifted tantalisingly in and out of earshot .
tr	1	Slowly but steadily , I started to perceive my own consciousness .
tr	4	It was dim and ill defined , but nevertheless there .
tr	4	A pair of dimples appeared in her cheeks .
tr	0	The sound of her laughter stabbed through my chest .
tr	4	A wave of unspeakable relief washed over me at her words .
tr	2	Cobwebs populated the distant corners of the room .
tr	0	She glanced away , looking as confused as I felt .
tr	2	We came to look for you afterwards . '
tr	3	' What of Victor and the others ? '
tr	2	' You lost a lot of blood . '
tr	1	' I heard voices , ' he said with a grunt .
tr	1	' There 's a bathroom across the corridor .
tr	2	Already , I could feel strength flowing back into my limbs .
tr	2	Voices rose from a dim corridor to my left .
tr	1	To my surprise , a chuckle escaped Tomas Godard 's lips .
tr	1	I sat frozen , Godard 's words ringing in my ears .
tr	0	I thought mother was an only child . '
tr	4	Anger and anguish darkened her irises to a cloudy sea green .
tr	3	' We don 't like to use that term . '
tr	1	' I don 't understand , ' whispered Anna .
tr	0	' The noble 's name was Balthazar Thorne . '
tr	0	' I 've always thought it an archaic rule .
tr	2	' Look , I wouldn 't go that far .
tr	3	' We got there just after your first death .
tr	0	' We always arrived at the same conclusion .
tr	3	' It took a while to get rid of them .
tr	4	' Did you know where I was all these years ? '
tr	1	I was silent as I digested this information .
tr	1	I said , astounded by this latest disclosure .
tr	3	They paused at the sight of us at the table .
tr	1	' Hey , you 're up , ' said Bruno .
tr	1	' He 's right , ' I said quietly .
tr	1	' I was just as surprised as everyone else . '
tr	3	' We still got ta eat , right ? '
tr	1	Bruno was guarding the rear of the manor .
tr	2	Ceiling to floor bookcases lined the walls around us .
tr	2	' And what were the two of you working on ? '
tr	0	She ran her fingers through her hair and sighed .
tr	2	It was too good an offer to refuse .
tr	4	The pieces of the puzzle were almost all there .
tr	3	I just couldn 't see how they fit together yet .
tr	3	At that notion , a different thought crossed my mind .
tr	1	Somehow , this latest news hardly came as a surprise .
tr	1	' You 're right , ' she murmured .
tr	1	Something far more staggering than a cure for cancer . '
tr	0	Anna glanced at him with a frustrated expression .
tr	3	This was just after Hubert made the major breakthrough .
tr	3	' Is that how they got your picture ? '
tr	3	That was before our trip to Italy . '
tr	4	' He was going to join me there . '
tr	0	' No , ' said Anna , shaking her head .
tr	2	I flushed self-consciously and glanced out of the window .
tr	2	' How do you know about the safety deposit box ? '
tr	1	' Did you find something else with this ? '
tr	1	said Victor , coming to stand by her side .
tr	4	' I 've never seen this one before .
tr	1	It looks like it might be a stacked cipher . '
tr	4	I could see wheels turning behind her eyes .
tr	0	I asked Anna as she started to unpack a laptop .
tr	3	' I 'm not too bad with them . '
tr	1	' She 's currently unreachable , ' said Victor drily .
tr	1	' This is going to take a while . '
tr	0	' It was a bit of a game for Hubert .
tr	1	' I think I saw something similar earlier . '
tr	4	I thumbed back over the pages and paused seconds later .
tr	2	It took another hour to uncover the other two .
tr	4	Finally , she stopped and put the pen down carefully .
tr	0	Anna glanced at me with a distracted expression .
tr	3	' But there 's something I don 't understand . '
tr	0	From that day at the Hauptbahnhof , ' Anna replied breathlessly .
tr	1	' This is what Helena was bringing me . '
tr	2	I opened my mouth to voice another question .
tr	1	I said , switching on the overhead lights .
tr	3	' Two hours at the most , ' Anna replied .
tr	0	' Thank you , ' Anna said softly .
tr	3	Bruno let out a soft whistle under his breath .
tr	2	' Why on Earth did you -- ' said Tomas Godard .
tr	1	' Why did I give him a sample of my blood ?
tr	0	' You 're right , ' said Anna .
tr	4	' But it never worked before , ' I said flatly .
tr	0	' It 's my blood , ' said Anna harshly .
tr	1	' I 'm not saying he did , ' I said .
tr	0	Tomas 's gaze shifted from Anna to me .
tr	1	Olsson 's words suddenly rose in my mind .
tr	0	' In the way of what though ? '
tr	1	Let 's see what the First Council has for us . '
tr	4	' Just give me the goddamned eggs , ' he muttered .
tr	1	He was trying to cross the border into Germany . '
tr	0	' That bastard , ' Anatole said under his breath .
tr	2	' You 're going to torture him ? '
tr	3	' That 's the spirit , Gramps ! '
tr	3	The two immortals left the manor a short time later .
tr	2	' So should you , ' Anna retorted .
tr	4	It had originated from elsewhere in the mansion .
tr	4	Anatole reached out and yanked it off unceremoniously .
tr	3	' And they weren 't trying to kill you .
tr	0	' Anna is Tomas Godard 's granddaughter . '
tr	2	He looked up , his frantic gaze finally falling on me .
tr	3	Is that what you were about to say ? '
tr	1	' The interesting thing is , he did .
tr	4	' Down here if you please , gentlemen . '
tr	2	Victor opened the door and walked into the room .
tr	2	He glared at us out of his bloodshot right eye .
tr	3	' Just let me shoot him , ' muttered Anatole .
tr	2	' No , that would be far too easy .
tr	1	An ugly grimace crossed the Bastian 's lips .
tr	1	I 've been running for a long time . '
tr	4	He crossed the foyer and hugged his son .
tr	4	The dark , piercing eyes finally fell on me .
tr	1	' Lucas Thorne , ' he said softly .
tr	2	' I guess I owe you a long-overdue apology . '
tr	1	The lawn in front of the mansion was crawling with immortals .
tr	0	' How 's your arm by the way ? '
tr	1	' The boss is asking for you . '
tr	1	' Mr Roman is who I mean . '
tr	4	Some visibly stiffened when I came into the room .
tr	0	A number of unfamiliar faces occupied the chairs around them .
tr	2	I crossed the floor and took the chair .
tr	2	' Soul came off our wanted list a long time ago .
tr	4	He waited until the rumble of voices died down .
tr	0	That 's going a bit far , ' she said harshly .
tr	1	' You 're not , ' I said quietly .
tr	2	' But no pointless heroics , okay ? '
tr	3	' That 's not the entire plan , is it ? '
tr	4	Not everyone wishes to see another immortal war . '
tr	1	' I 'm in , ' I said steadily .
tr	4	The time to see it through was now or never .
tr	3	That was -- better , ' I muttered distractedly .
tr	0	I avoided his calculating gaze and smiled at Anna .
tr	4	I turned briskly and headed for the trees .
tr	1	' Miyamoto Musashi was an excellent swords master . '
tr	1	' Touché , ' Roman said in a slightly strained voice .
tr	2	' I 'm surprised you lost to Felix Thorne .
tr	1	You 're as skilled as he is . '
tr	2	More than a few of the immortals wore faint frowns .
tr	0	He turned without a word and walked back towards the mansion .
tr	0	Anna glanced at me apologetically before going after him .
tr	0	' All right , ' he murmured , shaking his head .
tr	2	We climbed down a metal ladder and descended into murky darkness .
tr	0	' Make that a lot of dead rats . '
tr	0	A dark and cool cellar lay beyond it .
tr	4	Darkness and silence greeted us across the threshold .
tr	4	We turned and headed swiftly along the passage .
tr	2	They nodded and headed quietly down the stairs .
tr	3	That will leave four less of them to contend with . '
tr	4	The earpiece crackled again just as we entered a corridor .
tr	2	' Well , well , ' murmured Bruno .
tr	1	The second guard frowned , recognition dawning in his eyes .
tr	1	But -- but -- you 're dead ! '
tr	1	The words stumbled out of his mouth in a breathless rush .
tr	3	' That 's much better , isn 't it ? '
tr	2	' There 's only one way to find out . '
tr	2	' I don 't know what I 'm looking for . '
tr	2	' Can 't you just download all of it ? '
tr	2	Open the door , ' someone said through the woodwork .
tr	2	' Are Roman and Victor out of the building ? '
tr	1	' I know , ' I said quietly .
tr	1	Dark pupils dilated wildly within a sea of wintry grey .
tr	4	The thin lips pulled back in a sneer .
tr	0	' After all , we are family . '
tr	4	An ugly expression dawned on the immortal 's face .
tr	2	' I see you have your sword with you . '
tr	1	His first move was so fast I barely blocked his blow .
tr	4	His hand rose slowly and he fingered the cut .
tr	1	' He paid for it with his life . '
tr	3	My feet shifted into the starting stance of kendo .
tr	0	A snarl ripped from Thorne 's throat as he attacked .
tr	0	I was faster and stronger than he was .
tr	3	I felt my heart stutter in my chest .
tr	0	Her face was pale and as ancient as the stars .
tr	1	' I did , ' said Thorne with a scowl .
tr	1	' I could kill you now , ' I said dispassionately .
tr	2	I rose and followed Reid to the woods .
tr	2	The sound of rotors followed a moment later .
tr	2	I squinted upwards and blinked dust out of my eyes .
tr	1	' I 'm glad to hear it , ' said Victor .
tr	0	' Did she say anything to you ? '
tr	2	He stood back and looked me over with an anxious frown .
tr	1	I 'm fine , ' I murmured self-consciously .
tr	1	' Good , ' I said with a brief nod .
tr	0	' Well done , ' said Roman with a broad smile .
tr	2	' So did we , ' drawled Reid .
tr	0	He thought it might come in handy . '
tr	4	The Bastian noble scowled in the face of our stares .
tr	4	Moments later , we gathered in the study .
tr	3	' That 's the best I can do . '
tr	1	It was filled with reams of scientific jargon .
tr	0	A second later , I saw Anna stiffen .
tr	4	She looked at the Bastian tech and gestured towards the keyboards .
tr	1	Anna gazed at the information on the screen .
tr	1	Restless murmurs rose from the Bastian Council members .
tr	4	There were some five hundred odd names on it .
tr	1	Olsson 's was halfway down the sixth list .
tr	2	' It will only lead to another war . '
tr	4	She glanced at me with a puzzled expression .
tr	0	' Not that I can see , anyway . '
tr	1	' Yes , ' said Victor with a nod .
tr	1	He paused , his lips pinched in a bitter smile .
tr	2	' We had our own version to contend with . '
tr	3	And that wasn 't the worst of it . '
tr	2	She looked around the room with a troubled expression .
tr	1	' This virus has the ability to cross species . '
tr	1	Understanding exploded in my mind as her words sank in .
tr	0	I said stiffly , staring at her ashen face .
tr	0	' What 's she hoping to achieve by this ? '
tr	2	' Do you think you could make another one ? '
tr	1	I said , voicing the unspoken question in the air .
tr	0	Anna let out a frustrated sigh and shook her head .
tr	4	Although -- ' Her voice trailed into silence .
tr	3	Victor smiled faintly and turned to the Bastian Council members .
tr	2	He looked out of the windows of the study .
tr	2	' I thought you should come along . '
tr	2	I studied him silently , nodded and gathered my weapons .
tr	4	He paused and glanced over Victor 's shoulder .
tr	4	His tone remained light while he addressed Victor .
tr	3	' It 's the eyes , isn 't it ?
tr	1	' I 'm surprised you didn 't finish him off . '
tr	1	' I had my reasons , ' I said quietly .
tr	2	' Let 's walk , shall we ? '
tr	0	A faint smile appeared on Victor 's face .
tr	1	Anna said breathlessly as she crossed the hall towards me .
tr	0	Anna glanced at him with a distracted frown .
tr	4	' The equipment you asked for will be there . '
tr	2	' It 'll be all right , child .
tr	2	The sound of rotor blades rose from outside .
tr	0	He put a hand up to hush me .
tr	0	' It 's a mining map of the area .
tr	2	' The tunnel collapsed , ' Friedrich said bluntly .
tr	1	' He 's right , ' I said quietly .
tr	4	' We 'll leave half of the men on the surface .
tr	4	Friedrich 's team had used their time well .
tr	1	' This is gon na be like that time in Rome .
tr	1	' I 'll be waiting for your return . '
tr	4	The odd pickaxe and shovel still littered the floor .
tr	0	Up ahead , Anatole muttered a short prayer .
tr	4	The gears engaged and the elevator whined into life .
tr	3	The shaft was thirty feet wide and smooth walled .
tr	2	The roof of the borehole was lost in darkness .
tr	3	' That 's not good , ' said Reid quietly .
tr	0	The Bastian team leader looked at me with a faint frown .
tr	1	' It 's empty , ' said Friedrich .
tr	2	We joined him and looked at the body on the floor .
tr	0	' What the hell is going on ? '
tr	2	I stopped by the second body and crouched down .
tr	4	They were probably hired from the nearest town . '
tr	3	They were still attached to life monitors and IV drips .
tr	4	' They look dead enough from here , ' Reid muttered .
tr	4	There was a disconnected ET tube taped to her mouth .
tr	0	The body of a man lay in it .
tr	3	This time , the coldness that gripped me felt arctic .
tr	0	The last figure was also that of a man .
tr	2	A drop of blood had oozed out of his left nostril .
tr	1	he murmured weakly through dry , cracked lips .
tr	1	Either that or he was delirious from his sickness .
tr	3	Get out before it 's too late ! '
tr	0	For a moment , I feared that he had passed away .
tr	4	There was a burst of static in my earpiece .
tr	3	' This is the next best thing . '
tr	2	A shadow suddenly loomed in front of us .
tr	1	He shifted the unconscious man across his shoulder .
tr	4	Besides , we can dig them out later . '
tr	4	There was another detonation elsewhere in the facility .
tr	3	' Wasn 't this the way to the lab ? '
tr	4	His left leg was broken in at least two places .
tr	1	The Bastian Hunter blinked and gazed at me in mild confusion .
tr	2	The wall of rubble shifted with an ominous groan .
tr	2	' Why did you come back for us ? '
tr	1	said Friedrich , his words punctuated by painful grunts .
tr	1	' It 's a long way up , ' said Friedrich .
tr	1	A fine blanket of dust rained down around us .
tr	2	' How 're we gon na do this ? '
tr	1	The air left my lungs in a stunned grunt .
tr	4	' We 're almost there , ' I gasped to Friedrich .
tr	1	His eyes closed and he slipped into unconsciousness again .
tr	2	Violent tremors shook the floor of the tunnel .
tr	4	There was a small fracture in the wall of the syringe .
tr	3	Victor brought the cell back to his ear .
tr	1	' The injection site is a bit sore . '
tr	2	' The lady didn 't sound very happy . '
tr	2	' No , she didn 't , did she ? '
tr	1	' I 'm fine , ' I replied .
tr	2	' We 're not far from the compound . '
tr	4	He would take his stuff from his parents ' house and leave .
tr	1	Not a single light outside , and the murky sky tossed off thick shadows .
tr	1	Can you imagine anyone ever mixing me up with a Bolivian ? "
tr	2	" I would be seriously worried about anybody who thought you were Bolivian . "
tr	4	In the morning , she woke up to scruffy feathers and a beak .
tr	3	" I 'm afraid of the terrible goat that lives down the hill . "
tr	1	You would never think of Noah as anything more than a friend .
tr	2	" He 's only six but he is so worried about his older brother . "
tr	0	A giant block of Neapolitan ice cream , sizzling under the Peshawar heat .
tr	2	But no one would expect a shot to come from this distance .
tr	2	A cacophony of horns blasted from the matchbox cars snaking along below .
tr	0	" Targets are moving towards the mark , " Gabriel said calmly .
tr	3	That night , the feast at Ishmael Khan 's house was bounteous .
tr	0	Last came Stalin , wheezing like a badger in the hazy Peshawar pollution .
tr	3	" But that 's when you fell in love , isn 't it ? "
tr	3	Stalin , mouth still full of food , beat him to it .
tr	0	" It 's Franco Salazar , " Alejo said , cutting them off .
tr	0	And when I 'm done , you 'll know why Salazar has to die . "
tr	1	" I tell you , the Lord is healing me of my arthritis .
tr	1	Just as Tiago pushed his way through the caf door , sending little chimes dinging .
tr	2	" We 'll just stay a little while , be friendly , go back .
tr	0	Noah unexpectedly burst into laugher and ran his fingers through his hair .
tr	2	Just so you know not to try to , you know , hook me up .
tr	4	Memories flooded her heart , unwelcome , and she swatted them away in anger .
tr	2	I don 't know what I would have done without you . "
tr	4	Alejo glanced behind them , checking that they were still alone here in the corner .
tr	1	But Stalin 's eyes had gone all buggy behind his tiny round glasses .
tr	1	Stalin licked a film of whipped cream off his upper lip and sighed .
tr	0	Marco , until a year ago , was the Prism leader for Colombia and Venezuela .
tr	0	The broken hand of two-year old Jamila was what Ishmael Khan fought for .
tr	1	The chill from his conversation with Stalin yesterday still sat in Alejo 's bones .
tr	2	Ishmael patted the pocket of his gray wool jacket from a posh London shop .
tr	0	He felt the Khan push past him , forcing him further inside the room .
tr	0	Alejo took Gabriel 's place at the faucet and began washing , quiet and morose .
tr	4	Now that the violin is here , wherever we go I 'll be home .
tr	1	With his light skin , he did look a lot like an Afghani .
tr	4	Gabriel stammered , hating himself for not being able to control the tremor .
tr	2	Something hot and tangy oozed off Gabriel 's bloodied lip onto his tongue .
tr	4	If you 're hiding the money , we 'll slaughter you like a pig . "
tr	0	Gabriel swallowed hard , felt his Adam 's apple rub raw across the concrete wall .
tr	2	Gabriel attempted to roll over to one side , morbid curiosity winning out over sluggishness .
tr	0	A beautiful brick fountain gurgled in the atrium , splashing water across smooth pebbles .
tr	0	She panicked and tried to lean forward but couldn 't break away .
tr	0	A quick glance over at Eduardo showed white teeth flashing against his tan jaw .
tr	0	He paused and waved his hand as if to erase the past .
tr	0	I never heard Noah or any of the guys talking about this !
tr	0	He swatted at a mosquito that was whining its way around his ear .
tr	4	His mouth twitched and some of the old sparkle glowed in Gabriel 's eyes .
tr	0	One of his hands drifted to his throat and Gabriel 's Adam 's apple bobbed .
tr	2	" Sure , I think I could choke down one of your brownies today . "
tr	4	" Tuesday we 'll start getting everything ready for the crusade . "
tr	0	Alejo slammed a fist into the trunk of the banana plant , swearing loudly .
tr	3	To think that after all this time , Salazar still remembered , was still gloating .
tr	2	No one cared , no one was going to make him pay .
tr	2	I don 't need a lot of time to do calculations . "
tr	2	Noah now stood next to the foaming pool that formed the base of the waterfall .
tr	3	It was good they had brought Kory Tour 's truck instead of the Jeep .
tr	3	" That was the most fun I 've had in a long time .
tr	4	Just because I 'm too much of a chicken to get a real one . "
tr	0	" She 's pretty though , isn 't she , Noah ? "
tr	3	" Thanks guys , but I 've got to go with her , ok ?
tr	3	" The agencies don 't want to take passengers out this late , you know .
tr	0	" I think I rode a bus to La Paz after dark one time . "
tr	0	The man took a drag of his cigarette and sized Noah up .
tr	4	She looked devastated , red eyes visible even in the dim lighting of the plaza .
tr	1	I went to Montana for four months and never talked to him again .
tr	1	Noah was speaking , but focusing on his voice was a struggle .
tr	4	A moment later his eyes rounded and he jerked his gaze back to her .
tr	0	" We , my dear , have a lot to talk about .
tr	0	To her left was an expanse of flat ground and spiky , clumped grass .
tr	1	" 99.9 % probability , and yes , check , " Gabriel said merrily .
tr	2	Marching over towards Stalin , Alejo motioned for him to move out of the way .
tr	1	" If anyone 's having any fun here tonight , it 's me .
tr	1	Bad news -- you 're going over to bunk with Benjamin . "
tr	4	he insisted , inwardly kicking himself because he knew he was scaring her to death .
tr	2	You probably have a concussion , so you need to hold still . "
tr	4	Her tone rose frantically , and she curled up tighter on his sleeping bag .
tr	1	Sucking in a slow breath , Alejo tried to clear his mind and think .
tr	4	Who in the world were these guys , and where was she ?
tr	0	" It was in a package that we mailed freight to La Paz .
tr	1	Was it her imagination or did he actually wince hearing his own words ?
tr	2	If we let you go , that causes some major problems for us .
tr	1	" It 's Ibuprofen , " he said , mouth twisting wryly .
tr	4	" I 'll have to wake you up every hour , " he informed her .
tr	2	And just so you know , we have motion detectors around our camp .
tr	1	Noah in the cut-off shorts and a wrinkled t-shirt with giant Hawaiian flower flip-flops .
tr	0	" Time for prayers , " the man who came to get Paulo had said .
tr	0	Because the book wasn 't a Quran at all ; it was a Bible .
tr	3	Something fluttered out of the Arabic Bible pages , swishing to the nylon tent floor .
tr	2	Droplets of water still clung to his temples and curly black hair .
tr	3	Maybe she should talk to him , try to at least seem sympathetic .
tr	4	What were they all doing eating ice cream at Dumbo like decent people ?
tr	1	It was him , that skinny kid from the missing brother picture .
tr	3	It wasn 't the first time she 'd let that word float through her mind .
tr	4	The bulky guy stepped forward hesitantly and held out one arm for her bag .
tr	0	A chorus of cicadas and tropical birds was rising above the canopy .
tr	0	" Ok , you can take me back now , " she called sadly .
tr	4	Inside , her dropped her arm and latched the tent door shut .
tr	3	She started to ask , but Alejo held up a hand to cut her off .
tr	1	I told the guys I 'd be right back , Ishmael . "
tr	4	After a long pause , Alejo answered her , voice detached but non-threatening .
tr	3	She tried to scoff , but the effort just hurt her nose .
tr	0	A few seconds later , a Pakistani man came along and found him lying there .
tr	0	" What if that Pakistani guy had come along while Gabriel was still being attacked ?
tr	4	" Jesus said to love your enemies , " she finally managed .
tr	1	" If we can warn them first , they can run . "
tr	0	We can take it to get to Cochabamba and warn my family . "
tr	0	Alejo laid a hand on her shoulder , and she cringed , stepping away .
tr	3	But now I 've got ta fly like a bat outta hell .
tr	2	" Let your daughter lend some clothes to this poor girl . "
tr	0	Say , your dad said I could ask you a big favor .
tr	2	" I know the numbers of all your family 's cell phones .
tr	0	" Bring me a pair of really tight jeans , ok Alejo ?
tr	2	Some really bad people are going to come looking for your family to KILL you .
tr	4	If something happened to his family , he would never forgive himself .
tr	2	Alejo closed the door with one foot and slid the deadbolt into place .
tr	2	Crusty patches of blood had dried around her violet and yellow nose .
tr	1	He was sitting right by me , but I couldn 't find him . "
tr	1	Never in his worst nightmares had he imagined being reunited with his family like this .
tr	1	The unspoken question hung in the air , surrounded by children 's shuddering sobs .
tr	0	" I was the leader of a team in an organization that kills evil men .
tr	3	They would have killed her too , and I left with her to avoid that .
tr	1	Was the pastor shocked that his son had been living as a Muslim ?
tr	0	It was a heavy first conversation , all in all , after fourteen years .
tr	0	He gently closed the rusting door with a slight clang behind him .
tr	1	" Are your brothers , sisters , and your mother safe downstairs ? "
tr	2	I have to get all of you out of here as soon as possible .
tr	1	If I don 't get you into hiding , they will find you . "
tr	0	" He was an evil man , and the bomb was meant for him . "
tr	3	But I found out that if I left , they would come after you ! "
tr	3	Pablo muttered , appearing to be still trying to take it all in .
tr	4	I have more than enough money , and I 'll do whatever it takes . "
tr	4	Alejo shifted his eyes uncomfortably , refused to let his gaze ride to the floor .
tr	3	" They must want you to come home , right away . "
tr	1	" She won 't go until she finds out if Noah is still alive . "
tr	0	Alejo drew in a breath , and it was sharp , hurried .
tr	2	" It 's not going to make you feel any better , you know .
tr	3	This is not the first time Salazar has been to Thailand . "
tr	3	I told my parents , because I thought they would do something .
tr	0	They had a school , and three or four hundred people coming to their church .
tr	3	And who would be the light of the gospel to the community then ?
tr	3	After the emotional encounter of last night , she didn 't know what to say .
tr	0	" Alejo said that Franco Salazar was involved in all kinds of horrible stuff .
tr	1	" That part of our history is a painful memory that marked our lives forever .
tr	4	" Did he tell you we didn 't report what happened to Ruben ? "
tr	2	" It took years for us to understand how wrong we were .
tr	4	Alejo grimaced and massaged his temple , feet planted on the tile floor .
tr	3	Without all those contacts , I can 't get passports , visas , anything . "
tr	3	" I 'll put them on a bus to Lima this afternoon .
tr	3	They can get passports at the embassy there and take a flight to another country .
tr	2	" You should call the embassy to come pick you up , " he said .
tr	2	" I 'll stay with you until they know , " Alejo said finally .
tr	0	" My family can go on ahead , and we can meet them .
tr	2	" Yeah , right now , " Alejo said , almost sounding apologetic .
tr	4	" Fine , " she answered him , sliding her eyes back shut .
tr	2	she asked groggily , as she followed Alejo out the door into the hallway .
tr	1	Without turning around , he answered carefully , " I don 't think so .
tr	2	" Yep , " Alejo nodded to him , mouth turning up .
tr	4	The courtyard they entered was grassy , shaded with trees , and mostly dark .
tr	2	" Ask him how much for two days , " Alejo told the driver .
tr	3	And she really didn 't want to talk with Alejo about it .
tr	4	She wandered over to the bed and collapsed on it with slumped shoulders .
tr	4	" Its cold in here , " he offered it to her .
tr	0	Franco Salazar was dead , and he couldn 't say he was sorry .
tr	4	His voice cracked a little , and Alejo felt his shoulders tense .
tr	4	" We all need a lot of grace right now , " he said hoarsely .
tr	1	Without looking back he said , " Noah had Jesus living in him .
tr	4	He seemed at home in an expensive black suit with a sky blue tie .
tr	2	Drops of perspiration trickled down his forehead despite the coolness of the room .
tr	2	Noah 's father looked shocked , and his mother burst into tears .
tr	0	This is how they wanted him to be , she thought miserably .
tr	2	" I didn 't know he had a girlfriend " she rasped .
tr	2	" For your parents , leave this awful country and go home .
tr	4	One more hour and we can leave this place and get back to the motel .
tr	4	Just to be on the safe side , Alejo decided to answer the phone .
tr	2	Maybe he could just give some poor gringo directions and put an end to this .
tr	3	It took me a little bit to get this number , though . "
tr	3	" There 're all kinds of poky plants in that park across the street .
tr	2	The sound of a door banging echoed throughout the house and Alejo panicked .
tr	4	Gabriel called louder , banging on the metal side of the truck .
tr	1	Then she added , " Don 't do anything to Noah 's parents .
tr	2	I thought it was amazing , so many guys ready to follow God . "
tr	0	Alejo glanced sharply at his friend and then back at the road .
tr	4	The chances of Alejo surviving this next encounter with the Khan were slim .
tr	0	This house and its gardens and lands were his retreat from his mansion in Cochabamba .
tr	3	We 'll take a few little treasures with us to make it look authentic . "
tr	4	His friend hesitated , then turned to Alejo with a pained look in his eyes .
tr	0	The Khan was calmly flipping through a book , which Alejo recognized as his Bible .
tr	4	He doesn 't seem to be too disturbed that she 's dead . "
tr	1	" As promised , " Benjamin 's mouth tipped up in a dry smile .
tr	3	I 've got ta get my gun out of the truck . "
tr	0	Alejo let Stalin and Benjamin frame him and walk him towards Ishmael Khan .
tr	3	" He wouldn 't admit it , but this whole thing had him upset .
tr	3	" It could have been true , but that 's not what happened . "
tr	1	I caused something , and I 'm willing to pay the penalty for it .
tr	0	The older man 's voice cut off as he glanced away , dramatically .
tr	2	" You would destroy a book that even the Quran calls holy ? "
tr	1	" I won 't believe it until I hear it from your own lips .
tr	1	Gabriel kept his grip tightly on his gun , staring at Alejo , pallid .
tr	0	Say you will leave this blasphemy , that God has a son .
tr	3	That next thought beat urgently against her dazed brain , and she tried to focus .
tr	0	Ishmael Khan wandered off towards a more shaded part of the garden .
tr	0	Gabriel and Stalin began to haul the blanket slowly across the grass towards the truck .
tr	0	" He 's a nice guy anyway , kind of a pushover .
tr	3	Invent something to tell the doctors , but don 't tell them the truth .
tr	1	" Go with God , " Stalin muttered , covering his eyes with his hands .
tr	0	Do a Filomena , the elderly lady who worked at Caf Amara !
tr	4	The halls were dim and empty and a faint , urgent beeping drilled the walls .
tr	4	Five or six nurses in white were framing the bed , grim and sober .
tr	0	Dr. Ortega 's face shone slick with sweat above a bushy black beard .
tr	3	But her heart surged to her throat , vibrating with what she realized was compassion .
tr	1	He was sitting , suddenly , gasping and leaning forward onto the pale blue blanket .
tr	0	It was weak and lop-sided , and looked out of place on his pale face .
tr	2	Alejo was lying still on the rumpled pillow , eyes opened narrowly .
tr	0	It was such an honor that the Khan had thought of him for this job .
tr	2	Okay , so Gabriel wouldn 't carry out the actual mission today , of course .
tr	4	Gabriel was the mastermind behind the whole thing , providing all the technical support .
tr	2	The world was full of people suffering , their daily lives full of misery .
tr	1	But as long as I 'm with my violin , it feels like home .
tr	3	He felt a little faint as it occurred to him that Manuel was not coming .
tr	0	Gabriel slammed a fist into the wooden doorframe and leaned against it , breathing heavily .
tr	3	But without him , there 's no way to get close enough to the targets .
tr	0	She could cause all kind of damage to the cause of Allah .
tr	0	It was a building on Cochabamba 's Prado avenue , and it was burning .
tr	1	Even the bus station was sounding preferable now than staying here and watching this .
tr	4	she stammered , eyes searching his even though she knew he couldn 't see her .
tr	3	But it was obvious that something about the bombing had him upset .
tr	2	She said she knows you , and you told her to pray for me . "
tr	0	She heard a loud bang beneath her as the baggage compartment door was slammed shut .
tr	4	The man who wants to see you is a believer as well , your brother .
tr	3	The two visitors grinned a little , and the woman motioned towards Alejo .
tr	1	" Neither of you turn around , " Braids snickered at her .
tr	1	With each step , her cheap plastic sandals squished noisily across the tiles .
tr	4	" So , you can see now , " she eyed him nervously .
tr	1	The spacious room inside the house was a stark contrast to the blurry darkness outside .
tr	1	" Hello , " he said , hands loose at his side .
tr	3	" I 'm sure they just went to change out of those clothes .
tr	2	But for now , I really want to help you , however I can .
tr	0	" So , what I saw was a man with a gun against his forehead .
tr	0	" It wasn 't an accident , " Alejo admitted in a low voice .
tr	1	" I apologize in advance , in case this is upsetting . "
tr	1	Gabriel was repeating a prayer or verse from the Quran in Arabic .
tr	2	Mom , I will especially be waiting for your good cooking . "
tr	0	I pray Allah will purify me by fire and accept me into Paradise . "
tr	4	I 'll miss the brownies , the trips , all our conversations over coffee .
tr	3	" Of course , this is what happened to the Hotel Diplomat this afternoon .
tr	2	Only the Savior of the world can atone for the sins of men .
tr	2	I have to do something , or I 'm going to go crazy in here .
tr	0	" Ru really wants you to stay , " Tabor said , languid eyes twinkling .
tr	0	Sandal glared at him , then forked a bite of pancake rather violently .
tr	2	" I 'm gone of course , often , for my work . "
tr	1	By the time I was fifty I was on my third wife . "
tr	1	What he didn 't know was what was going on now , in the present .
tr	3	There is one thing we have to talk about now , though .
tr	4	Fallen grapes fermenting in the sun gave off the essence of sweet red wine .
tr	1	But it is kind of nice in here , isn 't it ?
tr	2	I want you to know , too , that we can help your family .
tr	4	" I really messed her life up , too , " Alejo muttered .
tr	2	" Can you get a new ID and passport for her , too ?
tr	3	Unintentionally , but I still believe that God would have you make it right . "
tr	0	He swallowed against a throat that was dry like sandpaper , then sputtered .
tr	4	" She might accept being a luke , but she would never love ? .
tr	4	She headed towards the office , where Rupert motioned towards a swivel chair .
tr	2	" I can never pay you for what I did to you .
tr	2	And now it 's time for me to follow in His footsteps .
tr	4	He let his head roll back towards the ceiling , then faced her again .
tr	3	There was something she still hadn 't said to him , and it was important .
tr	0	" Thank you , " she told him honestly , searching his face .
tr	4	" Should I give you the phone number to my parents ' house ? "
tr	0	I 've run away , to join the circus , as they say .
tr	1	Alejo found himself grinning , despite the contrition in Stalin 's voice .
tr	1	Stalin was alive and well , and possibly dining every evening on sushi and rice .
tr	1	I 'm sitting here in Spain at mass with about five little old ladies . "
tr	2	Then , following quickly , " And they 're all dressed in black .
tr	0	" But then again , so was Gabriel , " Stalin added .
tr	1	It was warm , they spoke Spanish , and rumors were that bathing was topless .
tr	2	, " God Can Control Your Diet " , and " Exercising for Jesus " .
tr	0	Stalin found himself taken aback when Shannon chuckled again , a deep , full-throated laugh .
tr	0	Stalin felt as though the flaming arrow of Cupid had pierced his chest .
tr	1	Sami felt his feet slap across the hot , soiled square in slow motion .
tr	1	" I know , " Alejo 's lips twisted into a smile .
tr	2	You could hold me off for a while with those lightning kicks .
tr	3	But instead of another bullet , a low voice cut through the clearing .
tr	0	" Get away from her , or you 're a dead man .
tr	2	Before the sixth dowsing of snow , I pulled my hood over my head .
tr	0	I watched Isaac stand like a statue , far out in front of me .
tr	3	I felt the rope go taut and pulled hard to take up the slack .
tr	2	I saw Isaac look up toward the Notch Couloir , then shuffle quickly across .
tr	2	Watching him cross , I looked down the full length of the 1500 foot cliff .
tr	4	I felt damned scared , but buried my fears and concentrated on my job .
tr	0	I braced myself again for the tug that I figured would be Isaac .
tr	2	The rocky face was cold and now had a light dusting of snow on it .
tr	0	The snowflakes were large and accumulating at a rate of nearly two feet an hour .
tr	1	Quickly , I dug my hands and feet into the snow and hung on .
tr	0	I saw Isaac look upward and I knew disaster was on its way .
tr	4	Harder and more determined , I plowed across the last feet steps .
tr	0	Isaac reached out , grabbed my jacket and hauled me into safety .
tr	3	" Dude man , you were almost a statistic ... pretty cool , huh ? "
tr	4	Fortunately , we were only planning on doing the very last fifty feet of it .
tr	0	Isaac pulled himself back over land and worked his way back up to me .
tr	1	You swing the pick into ice and pull on the handle to climb higher .
tr	0	I brushed the heavy snow off the rocks and searched for a handhold .
tr	2	I didn 't want to look down ... I couldn 't really .
tr	2	Something in my subconscious mind wouldn 't allow me to do it .
tr	1	I stepped on it and immediately pushed hard forcing me closing to Isaac .
tr	1	" If I wasn 't so tired , I 'd kill you right now . "
tr	0	Then , as quickly as the avalanche struck , it was gone .
tr	3	By the time we got back to our camp , it was after midnight .
tr	2	" Oh no , " Trae murmured to himself , almost in sobbing tone .
tr	3	The sight of the two still alive spread quickly to the driver of the car .
tr	3	With their guns still drawn , they wasted no time in continuing their task .
tr	4	With his hand covered in blood , they slipped off the edge of the door .
tr	2	Further south , along Signal Mountain , Dr. Phineas Morgan stood on his wooden deck .
tr	4	Perfectly concealed , they laid on their stomachs and waited for their signal .
tr	4	This would certainly be more tolerable -- as long as the good weather held .
tr	0	Dr. Morgan was a compassionate and sympathetic older man , but tough nonetheless .
tr	1	Instantly , his men responded and lit the fuses to their cannons .
tr	4	Instinctively he pushed the private 's hand away and opened his eyes .
tr	0	You 'll be good as new in a just a few days . "
tr	1	He smiled as he spoke , hoping to lift the Corporal 's spirits .
tr	0	With the ghastly wound in his stomach , he didn 't have long to live .
tr	3	It was the hooves from a team of horses as they trotted .
tr	4	He pulled into the clearing and rolled to the waiting operating wagon .
tr	0	Dr. Morgan looked up while cutting and said , abruptly , " Save it .
tr	4	With his pant leg gone , Corporal Fletcher 's right leg was fully exposed .
tr	3	Start at the top , here , " he said , pointing with the scalpel .
tr	2	Looking up at his assistant , Dr. Morgan replied , " Good question , lad .
tr	4	In seconds , he was nearly through the bone , as he began to slow .
tr	4	They are the various blood vessels that supplied the lower leg with blood .
tr	1	Working side by side , Dr. Morgan monitored his assistant 's work .
tr	4	Looks like some major hemorrhaging where the bullet hit the spleen , pancreas and kidney .
tr	4	With a better view , Dr. Warner could now see the damaged organs more clearly .
tr	1	" We 're working the areas now , Dr. Warner , " Dr. Stadler replied .
tr	4	The bullet exited out her back , through the kidneys , " Dr. Stadler replied .
tr	1	This can 't be from just the organs , " Dr. Warner replied .
tr	1	" More suction , Kerry , " Dr. Warner instructed Dr. Stadler .
tr	4	But there 's only one entry wound , " Dr. Stadler replied in disbelief .
tr	3	The cardiac monitor continued to report its menacing tone -- flat line .
tr	0	His mind raced as he stared at the carnage in front of him .
tr	3	He was no longer staring through the photo , but directly at it .
tr	3	Somehow it helped to soothe the pain that gnawed away at his soul .
tr	3	At the left side of the photo sat an old man on a rickety stool .
tr	0	The sound of shattering glass and cracking plastic snapped him back to reality .
tr	3	David thought about answering him , but thought it to be silly .
tr	3	' It 's just a dream , ' he thought to himself .
tr	1	He pulled away from his patient and moved quickly to intercept David in flight .
tr	3	Quickly , they walked back to the wagon , with the doctor leading the way .
tr	4	David pulled off his rubber gloves and tucked them into his pocket .
tr	0	David searched his mind for an answer that would be suitable for the old man .
tr	1	I 'd like to join the military to in order to practice medicine .
tr	3	Dr. Morgan signaled to the private to bring up the next patient .
tr	1	He now began to smile a bit as he came to grips with his decision .
tr	1	Resigned to his selection , David placed the instruments into the boiling water for sterilization .
tr	2	As if on cue , Dr. Morgan moved in for a closer look .
tr	0	Dr. Morgan now watched as any spectator would watch a professional in his element .
tr	2	This ebook may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	3	After all , I was pretty noticeable in this bright orange shirt and torn jeans .
tr	4	Darn , I knew there would be challenges when I came here .
tr	4	Strange as it seems almost everyone I passed was wearing a white towel .
tr	1	A hint of dryer lint and fabric softener in the air was guiding me .
tr	3	I guess she had to peel off the stuff that got stuck to the back .
tr	0	I took my chances and I grabbed what I wanted from the table .
tr	2	I hurried to one of the small windows that looked out toward a fading sunset .
tr	3	I felt I better stick with the guys so I went right .
tr	4	If I wasn 't so scared I would have laughed and enjoyed the ride .
tr	3	" It 's almost midnight , we don 't want to be late . "
tr	3	But how were we going to save this Jim and this little guy ?
tr	3	I asked , turning my attention back to the flickering boat lights below .
tr	0	There was also a rope and a ton of rock climbing gear .
tr	1	I was really shocked , but Miss Jackson just kept scribbling notes .
tr	4	" Enough , " Jackson whispered , dropping her device into her bag .
tr	0	This book is available in paperback as well as in digital e-book form .
tr	1	She glanced down and saw the tiny insect glistening gold in the afternoon sunlight .
tr	3	She started to stand and move toward Jessica who was stretching out her hand .
tr	0	Not all of the smaller roads ' names appeared on the map .
tr	1	No , it was probably some dumb worthless heirloom like his wife 's wedding ring .
tr	2	They drove on slowly over the now white and slippery country roads .
tr	4	They couldn 't see very far ahead because the road would either dip or turn .
tr	2	At the side of the narrow road was an old wooden structure .
tr	3	It would be a neat place to spy on visitors , she thought .
tr	4	One more turn through thick pine trees and the promise was revealed .
tr	2	It looked like Paul Bunyan had used giant Lincoln Logs to build it .
tr	2	There was no knocker or doorbell so Missy started pounding on the door .
tr	2	They came around to the front of the cabin and knocked on the door .
tr	1	" You must be Kimberly , " he said to Missy 's mother .
tr	1	His laugh was as infectious as his grin and Missy liked him immediately .
tr	0	He laughed that funny laugh of his again and Missy laughed too .
tr	4	She turned to her mom and asked , " Was I named after her ? "
tr	2	Now don 't you go getting your grandmother into trouble by spilling the beans . "
tr	2	Kevin had stopped just outside the door and Missy bumped into him .
tr	0	He was slightly taller than Missy and had dark brown curly hair .
tr	3	She tried to think of something to say to start a conversation .
tr	4	There were eight round tables with their chairs placed upside down on top .
tr	1	" I sell soft drinks , candy , and ice cream in the afternoons .
tr	1	A wide staircase led to a landing and turned to continue on up .
tr	3	It was full of pre-school toys , a tiny table , and two little chairs .
tr	2	My mom works hard but I know we couldn 't afford to stay here . "
tr	2	It would be so cool to stay here and explore , she thought .
tr	3	" It 's a linen room ... and the way to the attic . "
tr	2	There was no cord to pull on to lower the fold-down ladder .
tr	2	He hesitated , " And I don 't know if I should show you .
tr	2	" I don 't know if I want to do this anymore . "
tr	1	Trust yourself , her mom would say , people have instincts just like animals .
tr	1	" I don 't think so , " was all that Missy said .
tr	3	She put the coat on and knelt back down at the trunk .
tr	2	" Ooooo , " Missy said , " I know what those are .
tr	4	" Must be from when they had the stables filled with horses .
tr	3	Missy was thinking that this weekend had turned out pretty fun after all .
tr	2	She slipped her arms out of the coat and took it off .
tr	3	" Feel this , " Missy said and held up the bottom of the coat .
tr	3	He ran over to the lights and pulled the strings to turn them off .
tr	2	He was holding out a wooden puzzle box about the size of a large shoebox .
tr	4	I have no idea what treasures or secrets he had in there .
tr	3	This is a cool place but don 't you get lonely in the winter ? "
tr	3	" And I 've really gotten attached to that computer there , too .
tr	0	Maybe I should shave this beard and stick it on top of my head !
tr	4	I 've got more than a dozen years before I see one hundred .
tr	1	Something he had patented as a young man was still bringing in money .
tr	1	The last thing was a Swiss Army knife full of all sorts of gadgets .
tr	3	As they passed the fort it was half obscured by the two-foot high ferns .
tr	0	And I was worried about hitting another car , " her mom said .
tr	0	Kevin was on a porch swing waiting and immediately jumped up and waved .
tr	4	Kevin helped them with their bags and led them first to Missy 's room .
tr	3	At the table nearest the kitchen sat Mrs. Jackson and John Stark .
tr	1	" All right , " she said , " I give up .
tr	1	Missy , open-mouthed , stared upward , " This is so cool ! "
tr	4	Missy smiled to herself and then looked all around at the beautiful surroundings .
tr	4	He was squinting at her from the third floor and she felt very uncomfortable .
tr	1	Her mother was back in the city working and would visit occasionally .
tr	3	She had taken the items out often and thought about her dad .
tr	2	Missy ducked down and dropped the fern , but Kevin stayed steady .
tr	1	And the other two brothers , Rob and Rick , are just plain weird .
tr	4	The older boys quickly outpaced the younger ones and reached the pair of canoes first .
tr	2	From the back porch of the lodge old Mr. Stark stood shaking his head .
tr	3	Put these on and take the other two out to your brothers . "
tr	2	" What do you think they 'll do in the woods ? "
tr	2	" I don 't know , but I 'm more worried about Dave and Rob .
tr	4	If they run they can beat the canoes to the other side .
tr	4	" Yeah , YOU 'RE the little girls here , you morons .
tr	3	" I don 't think I want to go down there , " she said .
tr	0	Kevin started moving forward out of the cellar and into the dank dark cave .
tr	0	He felt his way with his hands on the cold stone walls .
tr	0	They 're probably way ahead by now , " he said in a low voice .
tr	4	" Maybe we should go back and move the stove , " Ricky said .
tr	1	The sun shone down intensely , not a cloud in the sky .
tr	3	Kevin finally decided that it was safe to turn on the flashlight .
tr	4	He got his bearings and they turned down the tunnel that ran under the lake .
tr	2	" Right , you moron , so we can find our way out . "
tr	4	Kevin gave Missy a little push and whispered , " Get back around the corner .
tr	2	No way would they get lost as long as the lighter held fluid .
tr	3	Rob pointed with his other hand first to his ear and then down the tunnel .
tr	3	Dave motioned to Rob to stay put then he closed the lighter and waited .
tr	3	They jogged in pursuit as fast as they could without the flame blowing out .
tr	4	If they could just reach the large cavern they could duck behind the drapery .
tr	4	They would think that they had taken a different route and would keep on searching .
tr	3	The right tunnel would take them to the cavern with the hidden way out .
tr	2	He held it out and Missy slipped under it and reached up for a handhold .
tr	3	They emerged from the tunnel into a smaller cavern that had stalactites and stalagmites .
tr	2	" Hey , Rob , look , I think I found a candle . "
tr	2	" Um , I see your mom coming out the back door . "
tr	2	I don 't suppose the younger brothers would go back and move the stove .
tr	4	No , hmmm , " he paused , " I 've got an idea .
tr	4	The mama bear and her cubs had stopped to chomp on some berries .
tr	0	For a very old man in his eighties he was smart and fun .
tr	0	Blackie was the smallest and friendliest and always available for a nose rubbing .
tr	4	Missy called their names and tried to coax them over but they ignored the kids .
tr	0	" I 'm glad he didn 't ask what the favor was . "
tr	4	Sure that the people above weren 't their brothers they started yelling for help .
tr	3	" Listen , " Rob said , " it 's that motor again .
tr	1	I like how calm he is and his trot is smoother . "
tr	1	She walked toward Johnny first talking softly and soothingly , calling his name .
tr	3	They both went back in to get the other tack and the helmets .
tr	4	Lonnie smirked and Ricky knew that they were going to scam the younger kids somehow .
tr	2	This time Missy grabbed a saddle and Kevin carried the bridle and pad .
tr	2	" Do you need us to guide you on the trails ? "
tr	4	Lonnie and Ricky looked at each other and Ricky shrugged his shoulders .
tr	4	" Come on , " Kevin said as he pushed passed them .
tr	2	Ricky stepped forward , " I don 't mind , " he said .
tr	1	Ricky easily mounted and Missy adjusted his stirrups for him before handing him the reins .
tr	4	He could leave those two bullies in the dust any time he wanted .
tr	2	Blackie stumbled over a root and pitched Ricky forward onto his neck .
tr	3	It would make sense that they would follow them back on this trail .
tr	2	The boys would have to jump into the woods to avoid being run over .
tr	1	Johnny and Blackie followed at a trot , bobbing their untrained riders up and down .
tr	2	Kevin halted Keno as soon as he saw the two goons drop from the branches .
tr	2	Keno bolted up the trail and Kevin hollered at the older boys to look out .
tr	4	Chapter 4 Dave and Rob were sweaty and hungry when they finally reached the lodge .
tr	4	There were sandwiches set out in the dining hall and they helped themselves .
tr	2	Your room is 212 and the other key you can give to your brother .
tr	4	Dave 's mom never should have trusted him with Lonnie 's key .
tr	2	They circled around half of Mount Rocky before reaching a two-lane road .
tr	3	Johnny and Blackie , however , kept up by trotting as fast as they could .
tr	1	It was all they could do to hang on and bounce up and down painfully .
tr	2	The last stretch was long enough for the horses to all cool down .
tr	4	Apparently their mothers had left the doors open when they unpacked everything .
tr	4	Ricky stumbled after him and was just nice enough to latch the gate behind himself .
tr	2	They slipped back into their own room and locked the adjoining door from their side .
tr	3	They changed into their bathing suits and grabbed a couple of bath towels .
tr	3	They entered through the front door and cut through the lobby to the dining room .
tr	0	Mr. Jackson had been a stable boy and Mrs. Jackson had been a maid .
tr	2	" No , honey , you 've just got the one couple .
tr	3	If they try that stunt again , ask them for a " riding coupon " .
tr	4	" Here , " Dave shoved a key at Lonnie , " get lost . "
tr	1	As soon as she finished her dessert Missy headed back to her room .
tr	2	Trust me , you 'll be old before you know it . "
tr	1	The sun set and the cloudless night sky was a wonder of constellations .
tr	4	Kevin looked toward the lodge and picked his way along the path .
tr	1	His night vision was pretty good and he didn 't have any trouble going along .
tr	1	Missy glanced over at Lonnie and Ricky and saw that one was nudging the other .
tr	4	Suddenly there was an embarrassing farting noise from one of the ladies .
tr	2	Ricky moved into the spot she had left and motioned for Lonnie to join him .
tr	3	They stood there with their hands in their pockets trying not to laugh anymore .
tr	3	Missy and Kevin got theirs last and sat down on their makeshift seats to eat .
tr	0	" Okay , " he said , " you can all laugh .
tr	2	While Lonnie waited for Ricky he looked out from their second floor window .
tr	2	Lonnie pointed to the right and scooted back so Ricky could take his spot .
tr	3	We didn 't mean to stay at that bar quite so long . "
tr	0	She smiled and added , " After a little bathroom break , that is . "
tr	0	He kicked up off the ground and plunged his head and chest through .
tr	4	But at that moment the other screams stopped and Noelle grabbed his arms and pulled .
tr	0	Grandma and Grandpa Gustafson allowed them to bring their pet dog , Noodle , along .
tr	2	Billy and Tommy , on the other hand , could be big trouble .
tr	3	Their rooms were straight up the stairs and Tommy didn 't hesitate .
tr	1	It was only three blocks away and no busy streets to cross .
tr	2	He was allowed to go alone , but he usually had to drag Billy along .
tr	4	It would be nice if a boy his age moved in there by next summer .
tr	4	Suddenly he tripped on a couple of large stones in the middle of the sidewalk .
tr	0	The poor thing was wearing a baby bonnet and a diaper and was meowing frantically .
tr	2	She nodded and Tommy took off at a run for the back of the house .
tr	3	First he fished out the gum and put two packs in his pocket .
tr	3	Tommy had fallen on his butt as soon as his feet hit the ground .
tr	4	Now that he really looked around he saw that all the trees were blue .
tr	2	One of them pointed toward Tommy 's hideout and the other two looked quickly .
tr	2	" Oh , you 're a visitor , aren 't you ? "
tr	0	Always take the left fork and pay for what you eat . "
tr	1	When Tommy opened his hand he was surprised to find a hard round pink coin .
tr	3	His stomach started to growl and he thought of the gum in his pocket .
tr	4	Quite soft and , he noticed , there was a sweet scent wafting upwards .
tr	2	More aromas arose : hot chocolate , fudge , popcorn , roses , tangerines .
tr	2	He put one foot on the mat and reached forward about to knock .
tr	2	" I can 't show you or we 'll both be in the dungeon .
tr	1	Curiously Tommy felt the bark and ran his hand up and down the trunk .
tr	0	Maybe he should drop his coins , he thought , and start a bank .
tr	0	It was as hard as going down the up escalator back at the mall .
tr	3	Tommy watched for lightning , but there was not a cloud in the sky .
tr	0	He thought again of the crashing sound of what he had assumed was thunder .
tr	1	Bad smells , skunky smells , burnt rubber smells , ashtray smells .
tr	0	He breathed through his mouth and found that he could taste the stench .
tr	0	The back of his head also sported a lump and he scratched around the spot .
tr	4	He pushed them aside with his hands and moved forward a few steps .
tr	0	He shook his head and counted all the torches along the walls .
tr	0	What once had been a small square room was now huge and almost round .
tr	2	The other boy 's hair was long and curly , down to his shoulders .
tr	4	Tommy wanted to laugh as the prince 's curls dangled over his face .
tr	4	He sniffed it a bit and licked one side before setting it on his tongue .
tr	2	" You can blow bubbles with it and make a loud popping sound , too .
tr	2	" Teachers , you know , the grown-ups who teach you stuff .
tr	2	" I don 't know many of these words you 're using .
tr	3	He took the gum from his mouth and stared at the glob .
tr	3	A red barn , taller than most , stood at one end of the ring .
tr	1	" Here , Willie , take this hat and bring me two riding hats . "
tr	3	A moment later the little door closed and Tommy spotted the footprints returning .
tr	1	You have finished reading the first 5 chapters of A TICK IN TIME .
tr	0	Kids call me " Morning " as a nickname ' cause my initials are A.M. .
tr	2	And we play , I mean hang , with mostly cool girls like Sydney Lock .
tr	1	You know , bouncy house , face painting and the other usual stuff .
tr	0	You could always count on Callie for a tissue or a bandaid or anything .
tr	0	What kind of animal leaves a turd that big and wet ? "
tr	1	She 's probably the most timid and easily scared of the four of us .
tr	1	Sydney turned and started leaping over logs and ferns and leading us followers on .
tr	1	I couldn 't imagine Callie or me or Austin in her place .
tr	0	Chapter 2 -- Back tracking " What in heaven 's name is that ? "
tr	0	It wasn 't that I was any more scared than anyone else .
tr	1	Again Austin was right on my tail , in front of the girls .
tr	0	I had been swatting frantically and I missed seeing the fallen branch across the trail .
tr	0	I glanced back and again everyone was swinging their heads all around .
tr	4	We all started screaming and then the bushes started screaming , too .
tr	1	I guess she used all her words up when she first spoke .
tr	4	Then we 'll open our eyes and see which direction most of us are pointing .
tr	3	Want to find out what happens next in all of these stories ?
tr	3	Thank you for taking the time to check out these fine books .
tr	4	When he did smile , it filled me with hot bubbles and vanilla scents .
tr	4	Part 1 Chapter 1 A few weeks and a very different life ago .
tr	0	I am proud of the purple bangs combed in a slant across my face .
tr	3	It 's no matter that the color didn 't manifest quite right .
tr	2	This is me rebelling , all badass with black eyeliner scrawled along each lid .
tr	3	He isn 't my first boyfriend , just the first one who matters .
tr	0	He could have been a track star or some arrogant frat boy .
tr	2	The current excavation for a sense of humor is slow but promising .
tr	4	" I didn 't know we needed enforcers , " I reply .
tr	3	It is very important for him to find just the right word .
tr	1	Ryan is unsure of his drawing skills , but he is brilliant .
tr	1	A club meeting ends and students issue from the building in front of us .
tr	0	The man puts his hand , palm forward , against Ryan 's chest .
tr	1	The air is cool , and the stranger 's arms are strong .
tr	1	My lumpy purse is under my hip , its strap still twisted around my arm .
tr	1	His voice is still soft , still calm with no inflection of emotion .
tr	3	He has changed into a navy polo shirt with white buttons at the collar .
tr	1	I don 't even realize what I 'm doing until I 'm doing it .
tr	1	The light is beginning to change color , and this is funny .
tr	2	" It 's okay to be weak , " I say for no reason .
tr	1	It shimmers like a rainbow in the light and seems to grow in his hand .
tr	4	A process that bestowed much more power , but that knowledge has been destroyed . "
tr	1	His hand grips my neck , and he digs a knee into my back .
tr	1	The flames lick up my spine , shooting hot coals through my arms and legs .
tr	4	" One more and it will be done , " the stranger says .
tr	0	The blur that must be him sinks against the wall and lays his head back .
tr	2	Girl who was unconscious for most of it or the guy who saved the day ?
tr	0	The fog rolled in thick and heavy as two shadowed figures cut through the night .
tr	2	Wait , you 're making me laugh , I got ta keep going ... .
tr	2	We both got a round off , but he was moving too fast .
tr	3	That 's the only reason I didn 't kill you then and there .
tr	0	I smell him , the sweat on him , the damp of his clothes .
tr	1	I keep reaching up hoping to catch any lingering wisps of the glow .
tr	1	I 'm giggling like a maniac , but only in my head .
tr	3	" My guy went through a lot of trouble to get this baby .
tr	2	My body jerks , so that I fall back painfully onto the buckle .
tr	0	The driver pulls a gun from his waistband , and I am not afraid .
tr	0	The blood stains across his shirt and jeans are already turning dark .
tr	2	" We 'll take the body back to Lo 's lab . "
tr	4	He 'll come after her again and by then she 'll be strong .
tr	2	" I 'm on fire , " I say for no reason .
tr	1	You kill me first , ' cause killing innocent people is what bad guys do .
tr	3	I try not to think , and the pain makes this easy .
tr	3	" Well , " he stutters , " just be careful with it . "
tr	2	You 'll blow her brains out as soon as I turn my back . "
tr	4	I can sense them , the different ebbs and flows of their energies .
tr	3	I stare at the glow as it rotates on a slow current around his body .
tr	2	Gabe looks me over for a long time , and I focus on his eyes .
tr	0	I let out my breath and feel the skin unfold back down against my palms .
tr	2	" Gabe thinks you will be strong enough to control the hunger .
tr	3	I hope that he 's right , but I don 't think so .
tr	3	Gabe would shoot me , but wouldn 't it be worth it ?
tr	1	My mind is lost , drowned in the pleasure that is all too quickly vanquished .
tr	0	He backs away , and Gabe lets out a heavy huff of breath .
tr	2	He looks tired and too young for the things in his eyes .
tr	0	Gabe is a head taller than me and thin as a coat rack .
tr	0	His long limbs are trapped in a baggy t-shirt and worn jeans .
tr	3	" I don 't know , it 's just ... it 's you . "
tr	2	" I really need to go to the bathroom , " I say .
tr	2	Shades of lavender blush within the cloud of color around his body .
tr	2	" Don 't take too long , or we 'll miss it .
tr	1	What if she mixes up her anti-anxiety pills with her sleeping pills again ?
tr	4	It swallows my body , and the sleeves settle into the crooks of my elbows .
tr	2	" Come on , " Gabe says as soon as I open the door .
tr	1	The air is chilled but warming , and the birds are waking up .
tr	1	I 'm not sure if this is a joke until Gabe laughs .
tr	2	" Gary Cook was the poster child for good intentions gone bad .
tr	4	" Cook 's theory revolved around energy transference , " Gabe continues .
tr	1	I thrill at the sparks of pain when my nails press into the gashes .
tr	3	Think of the way plants can just suck it up right from the sun .
tr	3	We get our energy by eating the plants or the animals that eat the plants .
tr	0	He thought that such pure energy would allow humans to reach their full physical potential .
tr	4	" Cook envisioned a world where everyone fed directly off the energy of the sun .
tr	3	Chapter 10 " Gabe , " I say to get his attention .
tr	1	My skin tingles , and my hands peel back and grow hot .
tr	3	I gaze through the tinted windows of a squat building three streets down .
tr	1	" But I 'm still ... I mean , it 's still inside me . "
tr	0	A bright streak of orange flowers and dies in Gabe 's aura .
tr	2	I think you should just relax today and ... " " No .
tr	3	" What exactly is it that you and your brother do ? "
tr	1	He squares his shoulders as the door to the roof bursts open .
tr	0	His words finally penetrate , and I quickly scoot away from Gabe .
tr	0	I have to turn away and wrap my arms around my waist .
tr	3	I thought ... " " I wanted to take her out into the sun . "
tr	1	The hunger is flooding my mind , and I strain to hold onto my senses .
tr	1	His face is all sharp bones , strong chin and cruel smiling scar .
tr	1	I see it in the shifting ribbons of color in his aura .
tr	1	Gabe takes off his cap , massages the inside rim with his thumbs .
tr	3	Gabe offers a little smile , but it doesn 't get too far .
tr	1	The sunlight falls across me in bands , and this helps a little .
tr	2	Dr. Cook knew Thane would come for him , for the formula .
tr	4	" ... totally exhausted , " Gabe 's voice in the background .
tr	2	" Someone saw you standing over the boy 's body with a gun .
tr	3	" That 's the other thing ... " I am looking for Ryan .
tr	2	" ... looks like Mom a little , don 't you think ? "
tr	0	They will know how much I loved Ryan and how much I miss him .
tr	3	I am forcing myself only to think of the present , to observe without judgment .
tr	0	I lay them aside , careful to avoid the black carpet stain .
tr	3	" I didn 't have to get you anything at all . "
tr	4	" Underneath he 's really a lovable teddy bear with an affection for guns .
tr	2	I make sure I am out of arm 's reach of both boys .
tr	4	Drops of rain on my parched tongue while two forbidden lakes sit before me .
tr	1	Gabe crushes the paper wrapper from his burger and throws it in the bag .
tr	3	" That 's what makes him the most dangerous one of them all . "
tr	4	" Grand was Thane 's eldest son , and he wanted revenge . "
tr	3	I was only two , but she told me about it later .
tr	2	Especially my stupid mouth that suddenly opens and lets my whole world spill out .
tr	2	Or my mom was a prostitute or the high school whore who got pregnant .
tr	3	I really am trying to shut the hell up , but I can 't .
tr	0	When she was sick she told me how she thought about you all the time .
tr	0	I snatch a fish out of the water and suck its life away .
tr	1	Gabe kicks off his shoes and throws his jeans on the floor .
tr	1	Again and again his energy field begins to smooth down , then jumps high .
tr	4	The sheer volume of new information is difficult to parse and process .
tr	3	I take my time with the handcuffs , giving them long concentrated pulls .
tr	0	It is amazing he can 't hear the wild beating of my heart .
tr	1	I will go out into the night , and I will run .
tr	0	I can hear the faint hiss of the highway in the distance .
tr	3	The night is dark , but my eyes cut right through it .
tr	3	I know that I could outrun him , but suddenly I don 't want to .
tr	3	They 're both worm shit rotting in ... " " Shut up ! "
tr	2	His concentration is off , and he is a second too slow .
tr	1	He shudders in pain and lays stunned , red crackling all around him .
tr	3	" I am in control , " I tell him through gritted teeth .
tr	3	Gabe stumbles out into the field still wearing his t-shirt and striped boxers .
tr	3	" That 's why she gave you away , to protect you .
tr	1	There is nothing harder , nor more painful than not killing Gabe right now .
tr	3	But just because bad things happen doesn 't mean the fight isn 't worth fighting .
tr	2	You 're my sister , and I 'm going to protect you .
tr	0	He runs his fingers through his hair trying to tame the wild strands .
tr	2	One by one , we slip back through the open window to our room .
tr	3	I try to ignore the song and what it tells me to do .
tr	3	Sunlight filters through the window , and I turn my face toward it .
tr	1	The scissors have a sharp sic to them as they shear away my long locks .
tr	3	The metaphor is too simplistic : a physical transformation that embodies the inner evolution .
tr	1	This is bordering on sci-fi graphic novel without the huge tits and witty comebacks .
tr	1	Possibly involving guns or daggers or throwing stars , or her bare hands .
tr	2	I will soak your dreams in blood and burn them to ash .
tr	2	Part 2 Chapter 18 Rust blooms across the sign pointing to Farewell , Colorado .
tr	3	Farewell is a battered town , holding itself together with stubborn grit .
tr	2	An old town of old men and old women grown gray together .
tr	3	I stare at his energy , at that purple saturation , with longing .
tr	0	" I know , " I say as I grab the strap .
tr	0	A woman is tipping a large watering can over the window box flowers .
tr	2	" Why are you always so mean to your big brother , huh ?
tr	0	" He has a good heart , " Francesca says , and her voice softens .
tr	1	She shivers , and I watch goose bumps pattern along her arms and legs .
tr	2	" Well , it 's always good to have you boys back .
tr	0	When the car moves on , Gabe falls back against the seat .
tr	3	" I could tell that she totally wanted you , " I respond .
tr	3	The paint is peeling and rust eats its way up the gutters .
tr	3	We move to the kitchen with its glass cabinets and long counters .
tr	4	Dishes are piled in the sink and reeking of dried spaghetti sauce and salad dressing .
tr	1	The dining room is next , which isn 't a dining room at all .
tr	2	A Ninja Turtle stands proudly over the broken body of a Ken doll .
tr	0	Here 's a hint , it ain 't got a head anymore . "
tr	0	He pauses , and I think he 's actually waiting for a laugh .
tr	3	The boys are still standing in the doorway , but I have forgotten about them .
tr	0	For a moment , I am distracted as energy flares around both boys .
tr	0	Diana is smiling softly and ducking her head to avoid the camera .
tr	4	All the lines on their faces come from the smiles they wear .
tr	3	Next is a bathroom and then a closet with towels and stuff .
tr	0	Canton would have Gabe 's laugh -- a free , warm chuckle .
tr	2	So I slip out the window , glad for the cold air .
tr	1	I 'm thinking it might be peaceful up here , but it isn 't .
tr	1	This is an entirely new body , acrobatic and strong like an elite gymnast .
tr	1	The squirrel is frozen in fear , its heart throbbing mad , making me crazy .
tr	4	He flinches when he catches me out of the corner of his eye .
tr	4	Even hit some deodorant now that we 've got a girl in the house .
tr	3	He 's expecting a retort back , but my throat has gone tight .
tr	4	I study the warring action figures arranged on the shelf above Gabe 's computers .
tr	2	" Did you , uh , " I try to be cool about this .
tr	0	Gabe spins his chair around , so that he faces me again .
tr	2	It wreaks havoc on your body , screwing up your DNA , no offense .
tr	4	And where there 's one dead angel ... " Body on fire .
tr	1	The fear of not knowing what is happening or if it will ever stop .
tr	0	I would lay my head against his chest and ... I swallow .
tr	0	That 's how I tell a regular heart attack from an angel .
tr	1	His mouse grazes across the screen , and each pin lights up with notes .
tr	2	" Most of the angels move around a lot , " Gabe continues .
tr	1	How can two guys living out in the middle of nowhere be fighting a war ?
tr	0	His aura is taut , ticking up and down like an animal on the prowl .
tr	3	The only thing I know is that I want to go home .
tr	3	When they 're not on a mission , the Fox brothers train almost constantly .
tr	0	" If Keira starts swooning ... make sure and ... catch her . "
tr	2	That 's just , well , God , she 's really flexible .
tr	3	As long as they can 't find you , they can 't stop you . "
tr	4	Yes , I would have killed the guinea pig at the table .
tr	3	I want to grab its soft body in my fist and squeeze .
tr	0	The rib is killing him ; each breath stitches red through the murky blue .
tr	0	As far as I can tell , Gabe 's face always follows his energy .
tr	2	I 'm usually careful , but when Gabe called I left without cleaning up .
tr	0	The way he ducks his head , has no idea how handsome he is .
tr	0	Avalon opens below me , and I drop into the magical island .
tr	3	I ride up the elevator of the tallest building and step out onto the roof .
tr	0	Ryan comes up behind me and wraps his arms around my waist .
tr	4	Her makeup is skewed too heavy , and pouches bulge beneath her eyes .
tr	0	He got real cold , and she was flown away to a dark place .
tr	2	Then I crawl onto the roof and watch him set off on his run .
tr	4	Maybe we 'll become fast friends , and wouldn 't Gabe be so pleased ?
tr	1	Just as I reach his door , I wonder if he locked it .
tr	0	One long jag starts at his right shoulder blade and travels down his back .
tr	0	Small , playful cuts just to tease and prod and many much deeper .
tr	3	My body opens to the sunlight , taking in the thin stream of sustenance .
tr	1	" So , the scars , " Gabe wipes his mouth and shakes his head .
tr	0	They always make a big deal about it in the movies . "
tr	1	Reckless , Mom said , but I looked up to my big sister .
tr	0	She called me a coward and other things , threw a plate at my head .
tr	0	I said ... I said , " Gabe takes a deep breath .
tr	1	I put my hand on his arm , and he doesn 't flinch .
tr	0	Gabe stands up and leans against the wooden beam supporting the overhang .
tr	4	The sound echoes through the trees , snapping me back to reality .
tr	2	He took them to one of his ' labs ' to have some fun .
tr	0	For any awkwardness my disappearance may have caused her and my classmates .
tr	3	I close the notebook and trace the intricate swirls on the front .
tr	2	We move through the woods , skipping over roots and shuttling up and down embankments .
tr	1	But I 'm going to win , and it won 't be long now .
tr	1	I want him to fail , and I sing it to him in my head .
tr	1	I am giddy with the idea of watching him crumple from heat exhaustion .
tr	1	Just as fast as it comes , the anger empties from my mind .
tr	3	His heart rate is still fluttering hard , so I beg to walk .
tr	1	To press guns into their hands and deny them a chance to know anything different .
tr	1	The question echoes in my mind then turns its fangs on me .
tr	1	I try to rein myself in , but the darkness is awake and churning .
tr	1	The night is filled with cricket harmonies and the slow dip of fireflies below .
tr	4	There is such a loneliness in this -- remembering what I alone have lost .
tr	4	" The police called off the search for me yesterday , " I tell him .
tr	4	" He won 't want to leave you alone in the house . "
tr	1	" Please Maya , " Gabe whispers , " sit this first one out .
tr	3	" I know what -- " " Just this one time , for me .
tr	1	" She 's not a lab animal ; she 's our sister .
tr	1	When Gabe speaks again , his voice is so low I almost miss his words .
tr	0	I roll over on my back and stare at the cracks racing across the ceiling .
tr	1	" I 'm assuming some sort of fraud here , " I say .
tr	0	" I am an upstanding , law-abiding citizen as far as anyone knows . "
tr	3	Tied him up , took his costume , threw him in the trunk .
tr	3	I shift the curtains aside and watch the Murano pull out of the parking lot .
tr	0	No , he would finish what he started -- a bullet through my brain .
tr	1	Ryan swooping down from the sky and snatching me up in his arms .
tr	0	Gabe walks through the door carrying a duffle bag on each shoulder .
tr	1	I look him over , assessing his aura for any hints of red .
tr	2	" Followed him until he was alone and ... well , " Gabe shrugs .
tr	2	" So , how far 'd you get with Zombie Hordes ? "
tr	0	Gabe brings back a scarred pit bull , the leash wrapped tight around his hand .
tr	2	" You play poker on your computer all day long , " I add .
tr	0	The jacket works , and the faded jeans give him an air of cool casual .
tr	0	A faint crash sounds from within the house followed by a high giggle .
tr	4	" We brought Chutes and Ladders , " Gabe says to him cheerfully .
tr	1	He stands in a boxing ring , and two lions prowl behind him .
tr	1	" You said he was a brilliant scientist , " I argue .
tr	2	A green light blinks on above the door , and Lo pulls it open .
tr	1	He takes his time , running his gaze up and down my body .
tr	2	" Freezer , " Lo says without looking up from his microscope .
tr	2	Bring us back some cookies in an hour or so , " Lo says .
tr	0	" We can 't afford to let any angels slip by us . "
tr	1	Lo rolls up my shirt , but he isn 't making any jokes .
tr	0	I lay on my back as the machine whirls and hums around me .
tr	1	She drains that dumb brother of yours before you can ... " " Alright ! "
tr	1	As the brainy sidekick , I 'm going to be the first to die .
tr	0	I sit up , yawn and rub my eyes , brushing the tears away .
tr	1	Took all the right pills , stuck himself in the ass with syringes every day .
tr	3	He would do anything to hit the other guy a little bit harder .
tr	4	The energy ripples in excited hiccups around his body as he steps into the room .
tr	3	The way he says it , I almost laugh but don 't .
tr	0	" Stop it , " he growls and grips both hands on the wheel .
tr	3	I pull out my journal and write jostled apology letters to my parents .
tr	3	But there are little things that I only appreciate now that he 'll never know .
tr	1	Each year we drifted farther and farther apart on our different tracks of life .
tr	4	I 'm beginning to realize that I might just have been a very terrible daughter .
tr	2	" Sure I do , " I close my notebook a little too hard .
tr	1	" There 's no ' just in case , " ' Gabe snaps back .
tr	1	" No , she 's not getting a bag , a gun , anything .
tr	3	Gabe takes off his seatbelt and twists around to look at me .
tr	1	His aura is growing bright , expanding within the tight confines of the car .
tr	2	How exactly do you propose to reverse this whole situation anyway ? "
tr	1	It 's all just me in here fighting against my own instincts .
tr	1	* * * The Fox brothers do a quick Target run for me .
tr	0	" Nah , that 's actually what he looks like when he 's happy .
tr	3	I tuck them under my legs and don 't think about the rabbits .
tr	3	Avalon destroyed forever , but I can 't even think about that right now .
tr	3	As soon as this hits the light , the FBI would be all over it .
tr	4	We still have a score to settle even if he doesn 't realize it yet .
tr	0	" Don 't turn your face to the cameras , " he says sharply .
tr	2	" As long as you don 't mind blood all over your car .
tr	1	Gabe crosses his arms over the hat and drifts back to sleep .
tr	0	We 're all that she has , and fuck , look at us .
tr	3	I also notice that the television remote is not bolted to the table .
tr	2	Gabe drops his own bag at the foot of the other bed .
tr	2	Guy goes off to pee in the woods , doesn 't come back out . "
tr	3	If they find that runner they 'll call it the same thing . "
tr	0	Dude got touched by an angel in a very bad way . "
tr	1	" I 'll sweep and see if I can pick up a trail . "
tr	2	It looks like a whole valley of Christmas trees fanning out in front of me .
tr	4	I loosen the fabric and rub the soft fleece between my fingers .
tr	1	I sit down on the branch and take in the world around me .
tr	3	Without thinking , I leap from the tree to land in front of him .
tr	0	Gabe tucks the gun back into his waistband , and his eyebrows come away .
tr	1	" Radiation is confirmation , " I say and am relieved to see him smile .
tr	3	I expect him to argue against my participation but he doesn 't .
tr	3	Then turn the water off and rub the lotion on your entire body .
tr	1	I reach around and pull out one of the remaining white bunnies .
tr	1	You were crying and stinking and generally annoying him even from your earliest days .
tr	4	This feels so hollow , like we 're talking about someone else .
tr	1	This isn 't my life , my mother driving me to exile with such conviction .
tr	0	Damn him , I can actually see happy lilac streaks pulsing through Gabe 's aura .
tr	3	We went straight to Connecticut from Tennessee to figure out the situation .
tr	2	" The day we found out was the day Grand took you .
tr	4	I can hardly catch his scent even when I 'm only five feet away .
tr	2	Without a word , we make our way out of the motel .
tr	4	I exude mentally handicapped charity case and Gabe just comes off as homeless .
tr	3	I learn on the drive over that this is exactly the point .
tr	0	I keep imaging a black shadow swooping down and snatching him away .
tr	0	I find the crumpled body of a man a half mile away from our stakeout .
tr	3	I listen for a heartbeat , watch his chest for breath and find nothing .
tr	4	Then , because it 's me , things get a lot worse .
tr	2	I don 't have to look down to know they are glowing .
tr	2	Soon , a whole chorus of shrill notes rise up out of the forest .
tr	0	His eyes flash back on me , gray as flint and just as hard .
tr	2	" Go ahead , " I tell Gabe as soon as the door closes .
tr	3	" It 's not that , " Gabe says , almost to himself .
tr	3	This is the second time he 's said that to me today .
tr	0	Gabe stiffens , and a wave of red goes through his aura .
tr	0	To me he was always gone , " Gabe says and looks away .
tr	1	He grips the sides of his bag , and the words rush on .
tr	1	" Please stop , " I whisper , and this seems to spur him on .
tr	3	" You can 't do stupid shit like that , you can 't . "
tr	1	His aura is a rush of rusted oranges , browns and reds .
tr	0	I 'm almost 100 % sure he doesn 't actually own a set of pajamas .
tr	0	She had this way of grilling you until you sang like a canary .
tr	0	I put my hand over my heart and raise my other hand .
tr	1	" Gabriel is supposed to be God 's messenger , " I say .
tr	4	" Yeah , he brings people hope and stuff ... " " Wow . "
tr	1	My mind is cloudy and confused as I slowly bob along the surface of consciousness .
tr	1	I sit up , fumbling with my gloves before I stop myself .
tr	1	His energy is a noose around my mind , pulling me closer , tightening .
tr	1	A part of me is fighting this , but her words are papery whispers .
tr	3	The memories lash against their bonds , the ones I can 't think about .
tr	4	He doesn 't say anything , but his eyes have those daggers in them again .
tr	3	" That 's exactly what the highly-paid chemists want you to think . "
tr	3	No , you just switched the screen , but I saw it .
tr	4	Gabe picks the melted cheese off the wrapper and brings it to his mouth .
tr	1	He 's typing into a password field , grimacing each time it rejects his inputs .
tr	4	This here , the grueling research , this is where the real breaks come .
tr	0	Gabe laughs and scratches the rabbit behind its long , floppy ear .
tr	1	It was storming ; we 're talking torrential rains , wicked lightening , humongous waves .
tr	1	The writer in me knows that dreams often unmask the unconscious mind .
tr	0	I grasp for it back , but he pushes my arm away and turns around .
tr	1	Anyway , I 've had my assistant looking for suspicious activity . "
tr	1	The rabbit is sprawled on his shoulder , strangely passive in his care .
tr	1	This is pure turmoil burning my cheeks , crowding inside my throat .
tr	1	I want to kill Grand more than anything in the world . "
tr	2	" So , I need you to do me a favor . "
tr	4	Not when his energy calms every time he picks up the damn thing .
tr	3	It doesn 't matter ; I 'm getting used to looking stupid .
tr	1	I think I already know what I 'm going to do with it .
tr	2	A vacuum stands in the middle of the floor , looking lonely .
tr	1	I 'm running up the stairs , skipping four at a time .
tr	3	I turn around and look at the figure sitting behind the desk .
tr	1	" You don 't seem surprised to see us , " Gabe says .
tr	1	" Humans are not commodities , " Gabe 's voice is rising .
tr	2	The lights wake at my touch and throw me into a world of confusion .
tr	2	" It is love that propels us to do anything for our children .
tr	3	" You want me to torture an old dude with cancer ? "
tr	4	He opens his mouth , no doubt to issue a rebuke about me wasting time .
tr	3	" It 'll be faster to cut through the houses on foot . "
tr	3	After a few slips , I kick off my shoes to gain better traction .
tr	4	Her face is close to mine , and I feel the energy emanating from her .
tr	0	As I slip off , I wrap my arms around it and twist back on .
tr	3	" I don 't think you can do that , " she says .
tr	1	I can 't be evil if I still cry , right ? "
tr	3	I have to feed , so that 's what I do . "
tr	1	" I 'm so sorry , " she whispers into my ear .
tr	2	" You 're the first one I 've gotten to apologize to . "
tr	0	Amber pulls me up and slams me down against the limb again .
tr	3	There is only a darkness that might not be the night sky .
tr	3	I carefully twist over to my stomach and squint past the powerful flashlight beam .
tr	1	Arms shaking , so weak , as I lower myself from the branches .
tr	3	Fingers in my hair , feather touches , but it still hurts .
tr	1	" Oh , of course , " he says , and his face is changing .
tr	2	I would help him wrap up the broken , bloody body in tarp .
tr	2	About why he got so close to me without keeping a hand on his gun .
tr	0	I couldn 't let ... " " When I was a baby .
tr	0	My voice cracks , mind cracks , memories rampaging , crushing boxes .
tr	2	" How could you bargain for your own life and not hers ? "
tr	2	" You never told him how Grand found out about me . "
tr	4	" Yes , " he says again , this one even softer .
tr	0	I tilt my head back and catch falling raindrops in my mouth .
tr	3	They taste like rust , but I feel a little more human for doing it .
tr	3	I clutch the sides of the sink , retching up the dust in my stomach .
tr	2	I will soak your dreams in blood and burn them to ash .
tr	3	He hasn 't found us yet , but he 'll try again .
tr	1	" I 'm going to find a way to make it easier for her .
tr	2	Bad things will always happen to good people , angels or not . "
tr	2	They 'll breed humans for food or hunt us down like animals .
tr	3	We wait the night out together , lost in our very different struggles .
tr	2	I pull my notebook , all soggy with apologies , out of my bag .
tr	1	Not until Gabe shifts in his sleep , and his energy jumps .
tr	2	No more worries , no more fear , no more aching loneliness .
tr	2	" You 're my sister , and I 'm going to protect you .
tr	1	Wasn 't the song drowning me and still I held my breath ?
tr	4	Friends Review Friends ' Books If you enjoyed FALLING , please consider writing a review .
tr	3	The opposite of the jittery nervousness and uncertainty that is the clay of Maya .
tr	2	The air is hot and heavy enough to mix with a wooden spoon .
tr	0	Gabe throws me a pair of sad eyes but doesn 't say anything .
tr	0	Sure enough , up ahead , the dirt road leads to a handsome colonial .
tr	0	Three floors at least , with a heavy façade of bricks and white siding .
tr	3	He 's rocking a heavy gold watch on his wrist that glitters under the sun .
tr	4	The angels emerge from the barn , dragging two young men behind them on leashes .
tr	1	The humans have their hands bound in front of them and collars around their necks .
tr	2	He then starts walking again , dragging the whimpering boy across the ground .
tr	2	" Come in , " a deep , sonorous voice calls from inside .
tr	2	" Come into the sitting room child , " that spooky voice speaks up .
tr	2	Now I wonder if maybe I should crank it up to $ 12.50 an hour .
tr	0	In the grate , a large fire blazes and throws shadows wildly across the room .
tr	1	" Surely you are married and have born your first child . "
tr	1	Okay , this part is definitely illegal , but I answer him anyway .
tr	0	" Damn , " Nathanial says , " it 's the telegraph . "
tr	2	This ebook may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	1	April could still have a bite in the air this time of day .
tr	1	Taylor tried to keep his friend Cody Hunt from ruining his morning rituals .
tr	0	Taylor nodded to a small backpack that leaned against the wall next to the door .
tr	3	The hot coffee worked its magic to get Taylor 's brain into gear .
tr	2	" I was just trying to get you out of bed for good .
tr	4	I 'll make sure to keep her off your back , " he reassured Taylor .
tr	4	The two men sat silently for a moment enjoying the simple meal and hot coffee .
tr	1	I 'll shut them up so you can have your say . "
tr	0	Times have changed though , so I wish him more luck for his quest today .
tr	4	I could not detect any genetic degeneration or defects in either plants or animals . "
tr	2	I want to go to the Ozark and have a look for myself .
tr	3	" How much do we know about the security status in Sector XXI ? "
tr	1	It was quite apparent that he did not have much confidence in Shiner 's capabilities .
tr	4	Maybe there 's a better future in it for all of us .
tr	3	he blurted out when Taylor told him the outcome of his latest petition .
tr	2	You are a genius , John , no two ways about it . "
tr	0	It was clear that he would not take ' no ' for an answer .
tr	4	Mary was in her early sixties and had seen the worst of the war .
tr	2	" Well , thank you , why not , " Taylor replied .
tr	2	I knew you would show up before your trip to Sector XXI .
tr	2	It looks good from what I see , should be smooth sailing . "
tr	3	Taylor studied the map prints that Mary had laid out in front of him .
tr	0	Arriving back at his container Taylor heard a Jeep engine approaching from the main gate .
tr	4	It seemed there were some perks involved in being employed at the intelligence agency .
tr	4	Taylor looked everyone into the eyes to make sure he was taken seriously .
tr	4	He had rebuilt and repaired this motor more often than he cared to remember .
tr	1	Flight controls , brakes , instruments and electric systems all checked out in his tests .
tr	3	The cargo compartment was still half empty which suited him just fine .
tr	3	Jump , count to three and then pull the D-ring , nothing to it .
tr	3	If you want to talk just push the button on the cable .
tr	0	It was a chaotic situation and there was a sense of panic in the room .
tr	4	' Paper , ' he thought , ' what a wonderfully predictable medium . '
tr	4	DHS officials denied accusations that the federal government had any involvement in deploying the servers .
tr	3	This system had been compromised and scrutinizing it started to become a favorite past time .
tr	0	Anthony Hager 's sigh of relief was heard and felt throughout the mighty plant .
tr	0	Rachel Summers taught sixth grade history at Lincoln High , Tallahassee , Florida .
tr	1	Something new and unknown , frightening and exciting began to awake in Rachel .
tr	2	Do you see any reason why we should not take this spot to land ? "
tr	3	Now it was time to get oriented and to plan their hike up the mountains .
tr	4	Farmer asked , " The canteens we brought are not going to last long . "
tr	2	" We are going to follow this highway north for about fifteen miles . "
tr	2	Cody , do you mind going for some fire wood with Farmer ? "
tr	2	" Not at all , come on cowboy , let 's go . "
tr	0	Hunt came back with his arms loaded with dry and brittle branches .
tr	3	" All right Ms. Nosy , " Taylor teased , " why not .
tr	1	' OK , you win , ' I say , ' what is it . '
tr	1	A hilarious little mouse in a red jumpsuit came to mind right away .
tr	0	" Well , health and safety , " finally came from Tim Farmer .
tr	3	With that she burst into more laughter and started to escape into the woods .
tr	4	she screamed at the top of her lungs while she disappeared between the trees .
tr	2	Taylor asked half jokingly , " So that would make you Dorothy , right ? "
tr	3	Taylor was glad that this conversation continued without another chase through the forest .
tr	3	The little child wore colorful denim carpenter pants and a straw hat .
tr	0	She had said that she would help them after all , didn 't she ?
tr	2	Lilly Ann looked at Taylor in disbelieve , " You want to have our cows ?
tr	0	" I can 't see any harm in what you want to do .
tr	4	" That is the least we can do for your generosity , " Taylor agreed .
tr	4	Lilly Ann walked up to Helen Spade and looked her squarely in the eyes .
tr	2	" I suppose I can leave your exact location out of my reports .
tr	3	With that she turned around and skipped down the road out of sight .
tr	1	" Was she just teasing us or is she for real ? "
tr	0	Hunt slapped Taylor on the back almost knocking him over and laughed .
tr	3	Let 's see how it goes tonight at dinner , " Taylor answered thoughtfully .
tr	2	On both sides of the road stood mighty trees of various kinds .
tr	3	Taylor definitely did not want to make matters more complicated than they had to be .
tr	1	If this thing actually moves by itself it is the epitome of a bona-fide miracle .
tr	2	He dropped the end of a rope ladder and swiftly climbed down to the ground .
tr	3	Hunt asked Taylor cupping his right ear in the direction of the forest .
tr	0	" Did you two run away from the bear that just ransacked the camp ? "
tr	3	Hunt just could not pass up the opportunity to have a little fun with them .
tr	2	" Oh boy , " Taylor laughed , " the sight of a bad conscience .
tr	0	They could still hear him laughing after he was out of sight .
tr	0	After he finally put down his mug Hunt glanced around the table a bit embarrassed .
tr	4	Willie , a young man of maybe sixteen years of age , approached their table .
tr	1	" I bet it 's good business too , " Hunt suggested .
tr	0	he protested , " A man can ask , can 't he ? "
tr	1	With that he raised his glass and finished the drink in one big gulp .
tr	3	Taylor was the first to follow suit , after him Hunt , Spade and Farmer .
tr	1	" You mean this is not what it 's supposed to sound like ? "
tr	3	It will use a lot less fuel too if it runs better . "
tr	0	He hugged her with his strong arms and lifted her off the ground .
tr	3	" Hey , " Taylor started to protest before Turner stopped him .
tr	2	Taylor disappeared into the shop rummaging around loudly in a quest for the required tools .
tr	0	" Sure , you stay right there , " Lilly Ann laughed back at him .
tr	2	I 'll tell the others , we 'll leave tomorrow at dawn . "
tr	0	Taylor asked her without being fully aware of what the question was really about .
tr	2	You know , I can 't miss you if you won 't go away . "
tr	3	The looming weather situation was in all the conversations throughout their two-day hike .
tr	3	It did not take much shouting for them to hear Farmer 's answer back .
tr	0	They both turned to Cody Hunt who was processing what he had just heard .
tr	0	For all we know Taylor gave his life saving the DNA data .
tr	3	It was almost out of sight when the first lightning of the season struck .
tr	0	" Make haste , " Joe Jack said as the first raindrops fell .
tr	0	He shook his head when his face lit up with an idea .
tr	0	Joe Jack cradled Taylor like a baby and eased him onto the branches .
tr	0	A day and a night and a day they walked without rest .
tr	1	Raindrops were their drink and hard bacon strips from their pockets were their meals .
tr	4	The rounded wall panels were decorated in colorful stucco reminiscent of gingerbread decorations .
tr	0	she turned to Joe Jack while pushing them through the door into her house .
tr	4	" He took a fall , " Joe Jack repeated his observation .
tr	3	There was something about John Taylor that sat him apart from his travel mates .
tr	4	His question from the first night remained the only words he spoke .
tr	2	Do you even have a doctor here , or a hospital ? "
tr	4	The more Taylor grew awake the more an avalanche of questions stormed through his head .
tr	3	They both went back into the house and started to prepare breakfast .
tr	0	His mood however came crushing down at the first thought of his legs .
tr	2	He still did not have any feeling or control from his pelvis down .
tr	0	Jack and Joe Jack heard your battle scream as you jumped from the plane .
tr	0	She waited if her words had any impact on Taylor at all .
tr	2	I will have to find a way to repay you somehow . "
tr	0	" Anything , " Taylor said eagerly , " just name it . "
tr	1	I guess my back was hurt worse than it appears from the outside .
tr	2	It 's all up to you how your life will unfold from here on . "
tr	3	She picked up the pot and ran to show it to Taylor .
tr	1	" Hmm , " she purred softly , " this is nice .
tr	3	Fill the lower part of the pot half with water and screw it together .
tr	3	Then put it on the stove until you hear it steam and sputter .
tr	2	He slowly brought the cup to his lips and loudly slurped the drink .
tr	2	And if so , why would she not just do it ? "
tr	1	Lilly Ann looked long into his eyes wondering how much he wanted to understand already .
tr	3	The first thing Taylor noticed was the unusual texture and color of the paper .
tr	1	I admire their determination with which they accomplish mighty tasks despite their doubts and fears .
tr	2	Lilly Ann jumped up from her chair not able to sit still any longer .
tr	3	Taylor looked at her not quite sure what to make of the situation .
tr	3	" But that is not the really important stuff , is it ? "
tr	2	This all sounds a bit like voodoo to me , to be honest . "
tr	2	That 's a bit too much to swallow , you know ? "
tr	2	Not too bad creating for someone who didn 't know what you know now .
tr	4	She pulled a huge folder from a shelf at the back of the room .
tr	0	Lilly Ann was searching her brain for an easier way to make her point .
tr	2	She waited for a sign of comprehension from Taylor , " Get it ? "
tr	2	" This sounds like a lot of work , " Taylor remarked .
tr	4	Then the road to contentment or even hopefulness isn 't very far .
tr	3	" Let 's start , " Lilly Ann shouted , " I go first . "
tr	3	We would try to stretch out legs so our toes get all sprayed with water .
tr	2	We 'd take off our shoes and socks and roll up our pant legs .
tr	0	What was he supposed to say at the display of such unadulterated joy and affection ?
tr	4	That is , if you let me join the game of course .
tr	1	And when we were finished I 'd give him a big kiss .
tr	4	" Thank you , Leila , " she whispered without anyone else taking notice .
tr	2	Food and drink of all sorts was appearing out of nowhere in front of him .
tr	2	Lilly Ann asked through the door on her way upstairs to her bedroom .
tr	2	" Will do , " Lilly Ann chirped and left the room .
tr	0	What followed was laughter , uncontrollable laughter and yelps of joy and groans of pain .
tr	0	Sensing that the jig was up Mr. Big disappeared like a black and white flash .
tr	2	" No , " Taylor joked , " this game is for fallen pilots only .
tr	2	She walked out of the room fully expecting that Taylor would follow her .
tr	3	I can 't wait to meet your mother to talk math with her . "
tr	0	" Whoa , " he laughed , " slow down the horses . "
tr	0	Lilly Ann grabbed his right arm and stood up , " Ready ? "
tr	4	The expression ' baby steps ' never had a more literal meaning .
tr	3	I went looking for it and there it was on the top shelf .
tr	1	He would never try to bring up ' running out of coffee ' again .
tr	2	" Would you mind if I had a look at the book some time ? "
tr	3	The simple yet powerful vibration that resonated with these words was not lost on Taylor .
tr	2	A group of children , maybe four or five years of age had spotted Taylor .
tr	3	Taylor saw more questions than answers arise from being confronted with this historic artifact .
tr	0	" Many put up camp and stayed to see where all of this was heading .
tr	0	Edie May looked at Lilly Ann with a smile and then at Taylor .
tr	0	The woman with the van had traveled all the way from southern California to Arkansas .
tr	4	There had to be something more to convince those first settlers . "
tr	4	It seemed that no cloud could ever cast a shadow on her sunny face .
tr	2	Watch and listen , and you too will understand , " Edie May promised .
tr	3	You put your boat into the river of life and you start paddling upstream .
tr	0	The audience was quite amused by the picture that Abraham was painting .
tr	0	Taylor did as he was told and leaned against the wall for support .
tr	3	He was most intrigued by the youngest attendants of the learning institution .
tr	1	Water was rushing between boulders and rocks spiking white fountains high into the air .
tr	4	This time the fish smelled the deceit and let the bait swim by untouched .
tr	1	Taylor asked Lilly Ann jokingly pointing in the direction of the young man .
tr	2	Look around , I would say it works wonderfully , wouldn 't you ? "
tr	0	Lilly Ann watched him with great satisfaction , only occasionally offering a helping hand .
tr	3	" And if I do that , I get whatever I want ? "
tr	1	" I think the reason is ' more ' , " Lilly Ann said cryptically .
tr	1	" There is a lot you can learn from a river , right ? "
tr	4	, kissed me on the cheek and skipped down the road giggling .
tr	2	The word Lilly and small child or baby is almost interchangeable here . "
tr	2	" Wow , " was all Taylor could utter for a few moments .
tr	0	" At what age would you stop asking a child for advice ? "
tr	3	" Not yet , you think it 's time to ask ? "
tr	1	You coming back in such a spectacular fashion sparked all kinds of discussions and contemplations .
tr	2	Everyone is rooting for you , that much is certain , though . "
tr	0	" How many miracles does it take to make a saint ? "
tr	0	They will make you their saint and call your house their church .
tr	4	" So happy to be of service , " he continued the joke .
tr	3	With that in mind , you also cannot get it wrong , ever .
tr	4	Edie May was curious , " Have you even thought about it yet ? "
tr	2	" So , the question is ' Do I stay or do I go ? '
tr	3	Lilly Ann seized the opportunity when Taylor had to take a breath .
tr	1	Lilly stood there patiently waiting for him to make up his mind .
tr	0	She laughed an intoxicating laugh , skipped down the stairs and grabbed Taylor 's hand .
tr	2	" So , you 'll stick around for a while longer ? "
tr	2	" Good news does , " Lilly Ann smiled back at him .
tr	0	For a fraction of a second Lilly Ann was thrown off balance .
tr	0	" No fair , " she complained , " that 's against the rules !
tr	2	" Only if you want to tell , " he replied nonchalantly .
tr	1	" We are looking for something fancy and fun , " Lilly Ann decided .
tr	3	Black and blue , can 't go wrong with that , right ? "
tr	0	" I am looking forward to it already , " Taylor answered smilingly .
tr	1	His hair was growing long which gave his face a daring yet poetic touch .
tr	0	She graced him with the smile of a woman who liked what she saw .
tr	1	Lilly Ann 's voice lured him back to their moment in time .
tr	2	" My prince , your ride , " Lilly Ann proclaimed theatrically .
tr	1	Willie mounted his driver 's perch and cracked his whip for fun .
tr	4	He looked at her as if asking , " Are you sure ? "
tr	0	Wan na come along to pay him a visit at the Wal Star building ? "
tr	2	" Hello , what brings you out this way on such a lovely afternoon ? "
tr	3	Nothing seems to be broken but it just doesn 't want to run .
tr	1	" You say this thing has been running for how long ? "
tr	4	" How often do you adjust the valves on the diesel ? "
tr	1	Lilly Ann teased him , " I could try it too if it does . "
tr	2	" Only one way to find out , " Taylor encouraged him .
tr	1	How am I supposed to know if she 's still running ? "
tr	3	Walking out the door it came to him , Law of Attraction .
tr	3	Taylor went back into the house and picked up his tool belt .
tr	1	So , here is the sign that I am officially hanging up my tool belt .
tr	2	Taylor turned around to look at his work from a new angle .
tr	3	We can 't get it started again to lift off the tree .
tr	3	Taylor jumped out of the car and ran over to assess the situation .
tr	3	Taylor did not pay attention to the objections the man was yelling after him .
tr	4	For a second he studied the levers and wheels to find his bearings .
tr	3	Slowly the mighty tree began to move , lifting its crown from the ground .
tr	0	Taylor quickly jumped off the farm machine and sprinted to a safe distance .
tr	4	Others have big ceremonies and parties that last several days or weeks .
tr	1	" I think I can help you there , " Fritz winked at him .
tr	2	Carefully pulling out the chain it revealed two small white gold rings dangling from it .
tr	3	That art is clearly lost on me , that 's for sure . "
tr	1	" I will keep that in mind , " Taylor said jokingly .
tr	2	" So , what did you have on your mind earlier ? "
tr	2	Taylor pulled the ring out of his pocket , still hiding it from Lilly Ann .
tr	2	" Don 't ask , " he groaned , " she shot me down cold .
tr	2	I 'm afraid my head would explode if I would try . "
tr	2	She is your mother and you obviously love her and she loves you .
tr	2	That is enough reason for me to want to love her . "
tr	0	The guys are waiting for us at Magic Mountain for your bachelor 's party .
tr	3	Taylor had not even considered that this tradition had survived in this remote area .
tr	3	We 'll take her van to drive out to the bottom of the hills .
tr	0	He had grabbed a warm sweater for Taylor on his way out .
tr	0	" Now that 's what I call a party , " Taylor exclaimed .
tr	2	Taylor was handed around from table to table and from group to group .
tr	1	As soon as he had sat down an endless barrage of drinking toasts ensued .
tr	4	The violin screamed its heart out , as the girl 's dance grew wilder .
tr	0	It was Taylor who managed to regain control of his limbs and banished the spell .
tr	1	I drowned in your spirit , Lilly Ann , your beauty and your grace .
tr	3	They sure made an honest attempt to find out just how much .
tr	0	Lilly Ann asked her mother a few days later at the breakfast table .
tr	1	" Papa is going to make his transition soon , " Lilly Ann said cheerfully .
tr	2	How can you be so certain of something that you really cannot know ? "
tr	1	I 'm not that wise , but she always has been and still is . "
tr	1	" I guess it is , " Fritz joined into the laughter .
tr	4	Don 't you ever loose that , it is precious - priceless . "
tr	0	" All right , " Taylor answered a bit skeptically , " You are on .
tr	1	I 'm telling you , this is going to be so much fun . "
tr	0	Laughing and cheering and candid expressions of love and appreciation accompanied the tales .
tr	3	The stories and jokes that were told that night had a common theme though .
tr	2	" Oh , " Taylor just replied and slowly nodded his head .
tr	2	One sip from the magic potion was all the proof Taylor needed .
tr	3	It took us many months to work through that little curveball . "
tr	2	" So you didn 't die , I suppose , " Taylor joked .
tr	2	" Sounds like a bad case of good peyote to me , " Taylor laughed .
tr	3	He couldn 't stop saying , ' Did you hear that ? '
tr	4	Even after all these years Lilly Grace was still in awe by this simple concept .
tr	2	Lilly Grace laughed , " It is really not so simple to say .
tr	3	It is a beautiful constellation with just a few hundred thousand stars .
tr	3	One of them is a hot , white glowing sun with fifteen tiny planets .
tr	3	Fun and joy , all the rest is just a means to that end . "
tr	3	Taylor mockingly stood at attention and snapped his right hand to his temple .
tr	0	" What did ma and you have to discuss all afternoon ? "
tr	2	" Oh , " Taylor chuckled , " sorry for being so assumptions .
tr	4	I also need to clean up before I can leave the house . "
tr	4	" I asked Jack and Joe Jack to help me get your airplane here .
tr	3	" I thought that some of the parts looked awfully familiar , " Taylor smiled .
tr	2	" Naturally , " Wilbur agreed and looked tensely at Lilly Ann .
tr	1	Wilbur had no trepidation getting his hands dirty and neither did Taylor .
tr	1	All the way down the list he announced , " Ignition on , check . "
tr	3	" Let 's get to work then , " Taylor assumed control of the situation .
tr	3	The reaction to aileron input was smooth and predictable and the plane turned without complaint .
tr	3	Taylor turned the plane back towards the airfield and set it straight and level .
tr	3	After counting to five he released the control stick stretching his arms to both sides .
tr	1	Wilbur had to remind himself to soften his white-knuckle grip on the flight stick .
tr	2	Taylor surfaced from his contemplation , " Oh , I 'm sorry , love .
tr	4	" It sure would be nice to see Cody again , " he added quietly .
tr	2	" Do you think the world you came from is broken and needs fixing ? "
tr	0	" You are wearing a new dress , " Taylor gladly played along .
tr	2	" This Lilly , " she said , " our Lilly . "
tr	2	Security is in what we know , not in what we have . "
tr	0	The changes Taylor saw in Lilly Ann were gradual , yet dramatic .
tr	0	She purred her satisfaction with that answer and snuggled up against him .
tr	0	He would not have missed the birth of his daughter for anything in the world .
tr	0	Sandra was suitably distracted , and we disappeared off into a multitude of aircraft hangars .
tr	0	I asked , ' isn 't that a bit of wasted hardware ? '
tr	0	I walked around the glass walkway to the ' senior staff quarters ' .
tr	3	' I want Teddy to become my full time Director of Aviation . '
tr	4	Now all I needed to do was get them to Dorset - enter the Lawyers .
tr	2	Two down , two to go , was someone trying to tell me something ?
tr	2	It 's a good job that I already know my port from my starboard .
tr	0	Apparently he was on a ' too lower a pay grade ' to think .
tr	3	, would I like them to take her straight to England ' .
tr	0	I was amazed , one man controlling this leviathan - he must be superhuman .
tr	2	' For when I go to the toilet , the door lock is broken ' .
tr	2	( Topsy , when asked ' why didn 't you go through for Officer ? '
tr	0	' Have any of the team got four engined aircraft rating ? '
tr	3	Good lad , he was starting to get the hang of it at last .
tr	1	' Guess work ' she said , ' but based on sound logic .
tr	4	, and just in time to see me disappear out of the door .
tr	0	' What about road blocks , aerial surveillance , c. . . ' ?
tr	3	He pitied the four thugs , not a lot , but a little .
tr	0	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
tr	2	If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you .
tr	4	I have spoken to their parents and all 's well that ends well ' .
tr	2	David wanted his pound of flesh ( or was it now a kilo ? )
tr	3	When the skins start to bubble , split along their length with a fork .
tr	4	She had found El Campo by accident when her engines had started spluttering .
tr	1	' Daiquiri por favor ' Sasha replied , I liked her style .
tr	1	Cloth -- most likely grease impregnated - with imprint of a key in it .
tr	0	I glanced down at it , and gave an almost imperceptible nod .
tr	1	I was starting not to like the direction this one sided conversation was going in .
tr	4	I picked up the second letter and of course it was from David .
tr	2	On my return perhaps I should try to broaden my horizons , but how ?
tr	2	I looked at the cover , ' Road to Recovery ' by Tony Wilson .
tr	3	' Do you want me to empty the stuff out of her stern ? '
tr	4	' Mind you if you use any of them , you replace them ' .
tr	2	Landscapes , seascapes , cityscapes , still-life , floral , rural or mythological ? '
tr	4	I shook my head and signalled her to rotate it a further 45 degree .
tr	1	It was crude , but it kept him alive until the paramedics arrived .
tr	2	' Good one ' I thought , trying rather unsuccessfully to be serious .
tr	1	These days everyone fished , so it had raised no one 's suspicions .
tr	1	Panels and commissions sprang up everywhere searching for solutions and assigning blame .
tr	4	Nothing was spared as even zoos were raided , and their collections butchered and eaten .
tr	1	Living with only nature for a companion was turning me into a swamp rat .
tr	0	I was only a few feet away and fired two more rounds almost point-blank .
tr	3	I misjudged and hit hard enough that I was almost thrown out of the seat .
tr	3	" Everything 's all right ; those two animals won 't bother you again . "
tr	1	I removed the gag and began working on the knots binding her wrists .
tr	2	" OK , let 's get going and find you some clothes . "
tr	1	She said , in a voice , filled with alarm and fright .
tr	3	I took what was left of her old clothes and tossed them in the cockpit .
tr	4	She dried off , dressed , and emerged with her hair wrapped in a towel .
tr	3	Ralph tried to force me , but I didn 't they took ... . "
tr	0	We came to a big trawler which took up almost the whole canal .
tr	3	We towed it with the canoe stopping to pick up our booty as we went .
tr	4	GW I never asked before but what do you think happened ... really ?
tr	4	I believe that Nature and God are closely connected possibly one and the same .
tr	0	I tuned back , and coming through the speaker was a man 's voice .
tr	1	I hope civilization takes its sweet ass time catching up to us .
tr	1	I said , " I think I just heard a ghost . "
tr	0	I had to admit his ordeal of survival had far eclipsed ours .
tr	3	We changed out the battery , and I topped it off with gas .
tr	2	I felt stupid for not doing it sooner , but nobody listened to AM anymore .
tr	4	At the present , everyone was engaged in some aspect of food or energy production .
tr	4	We sat at the mess table and were asked if we would like something .
tr	1	My first contact with civilization had already begun pulling at our relationship .
tr	1	Modern civilization failed us both and I won 't let it happen again .
tr	0	I said , " Yeah , a couple , and also an Icom SSB . "
tr	4	I love you GW , I believe our paths were meant to cross .
tr	4	We walked across the bridge and down the steps to the dock .
tr	3	I 'm tempted to tell Allan Bright we 're just going to stay here .
tr	1	I said , " I 'll make it as quick as I can . "
tr	1	I noticed she had the pistol out and was fingering it nervously .
tr	1	I went ashore , Connie said , " Call Skipper take him with you . "
tr	1	When I had finished , I stood for a moment , then said .
tr	1	He said , " Are you under power or sail sir ? "
tr	0	I heard Allan say , " Thanks , Sherry , send him in . "
tr	3	This symposium is an attempt to find ways to straighten out this mess .
tr	1	I 've modified many of my views since I wrote the original article .
tr	0	Now you have a willing audience , and you want to back off .
tr	1	She said , " It 's tempting but what Captain Bright says makes sense .
tr	3	Let 's just say it wasn 't a happy time for an introvert .
tr	2	She said , " Mine as well , you look so wonderfully military . "
tr	1	I also noticed she studied some individuals more than others as if sizing them up .
tr	0	Constance Francine Parker will you marry me and make me your husband ? "
tr	2	Connie asked , " How do you feel , you going to be alright ?
tr	2	" Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to come before you today .
tr	1	" Now I 'll turn it back to my distinguished colleague Dr. Binder . "
tr	0	Yeah , Allan had a unique way of yanking me out of my comfort zone .
tr	2	I retorted , " Hell I 'm already an old salt . "
tr	2	Four in the morning I awoke to someone knocking on the boat .
tr	1	I said , " OK , I 'll be with you in a minute . "
tr	1	I said , " I 'll just get in the way . "
tr	3	I doubt the tanker is capable of making more than fifteen knots tops .
tr	1	I said , " Just try and keep us in some sort of firing position .
tr	2	I shouted again , " Fire Control , Yes or No ! "
tr	0	I said , " Train on target wait for my command . "
tr	4	I asked the kid on the con , " We have propulsion and steerage ? "
tr	2	The dead placed into body bags and laid on the flight deck .
tr	4	I was standing on the bridge when we reached the sea buoy .
tr	1	Jim said , " Sir would you like to take her in ? "
tr	4	Still we held each other as if we had been separated for a year .
tr	2	I waved that I understood and the plane dipped its wings and headed east .
tr	0	Allan had a car standing by and was waiting to meet us at the Pisces .
tr	1	Isn 't it against international convention to be arming research vessels ? "
tr	4	Where we intend to cruise , I see no way to obtain parts .
tr	3	" Herb you 're last but not least , like to add anything ? "
tr	3	I take comfort in the fact you 're both more than qualified to run Pisces .
tr	4	Let me add the same rules apply to you ladies as well .
tr	1	Jim , Herb she 's all yours I 'm going to turn in . "
tr	0	If conditions are , right maybe , take the chopper and have a look around .
tr	2	It 's your decision how far down the chain you go from there .
tr	0	I had taken Herb aside and asked , " Think they got a chance ? "
tr	3	I didn 't mind taking care of bottlenecks as they came with the job .
tr	1	Herb said , " I was quartermaster of provisioning on a guided missile frigate . "
tr	1	You have written orders giving us priority to requisition , use them .
tr	4	What else had I missed , was there something more ominous we knew nothing about ?
tr	0	" Captain Bright informed me there was a hijacking involving a truckload of meat .
tr	3	Captain it 's going to be an interesting trip to Key West . "
tr	2	It took two hours to get everyone on board and cast off .
tr	4	" Welcome to Key West George how 's Pisces been performing for you ? "
tr	1	" What a turnaround , first diplomatic mission for the US will be Cuba !
tr	0	The Mohawk stayed far enough back that she could act as support .
tr	0	I agreed and also gave many of the crew access to assault rifles .
tr	4	If we anchored close to shore , the watch would be doubled and armed .
tr	4	These rules could only amended by Jim , Herb , or myself .
tr	3	It 's better to keep our guard up until we know all the facts . "
tr	0	I said , " Great that 's all I need is a Sapphic aboard . "
tr	2	" My girls , I only got two , you , and the ship . "
tr	2	I said , " I 'll be damned , had no idea . "
tr	0	I looked through the glasses and saw a man and woman sailing in our direction .
tr	4	They said there was only a dozen or so left they knew of .
tr	2	" Captain I 'll be done in a couple of hours . "
tr	2	Looks to be a rough day tomorrow honey , try to get some sleep . "
tr	4	Bring the couple on board and have them wait in the conference room . "
tr	0	She said , " Let me run get my laptop I have a translation app .
tr	2	It took almost an hour for Connie to come up with the story .
tr	0	I was going to have to stall them and formulate a plan .
tr	4	I sent the couple out and had Jim and Herb come in .
tr	3	Dennis watched and studied making a mental picture getting the rhythm of the group .
tr	1	In the darkness , we took turns with the night vision glasses .
tr	0	A blanket was quickly passed down ; she was wrapped and helped on board .
tr	4	Herb gave the order and in three rounds the boat and people ceased to exist .
tr	0	I sent a short report to Allan by radio as we proceeded to San Juan .
tr	3	In future , I would greatly appreciate it if you tried to follow them .
tr	0	He had become the official unofficial Commander of both the Coast Guard and Navy .
tr	3	This was a US protectorate and it was our obligation to help out its people .
tr	4	It 's understood by everyone that things can never be as they were .
tr	3	" No sir not at all , this is getting interesting . "
tr	1	" I said , " Keep in mind , it could also get dangerous . "
tr	0	It was a certainty that one small tanker of fuel could not an empire maintain .
tr	0	I think Mr. Vella has plans in place and is ready to act upon them .
tr	3	Herb asked , " You think the Jackson kids a party to it ? "
tr	3	I sent Dennis along with them to scope out the battery at Morro Castle .
tr	4	I decided tomorrow I would get Gerald and take a tour in the chopper .
tr	4	The rapping came again , usually I would be hailed on the intercom or phone .
tr	1	" Yes Sir , " I said , " Go ahead shoot . "
tr	2	Hell Jeff , pull this off and your well on your way to flag rank .
tr	2	They had done it under the guise of working on one of the patrol boats .
tr	1	He holds all the strings and makes all of the decisions himself .
tr	3	" That 's what she told you ; wan na know what she told me .
tr	1	I 'm sure the bastard 's already done it in his mind .
tr	1	I said , " Not me honey I married you strictly for your mind . "
tr	0	Vella introduced us all around with Linda and Jeff providing additional translation .
tr	0	I thought good girl charm the snake then watch hubby pinch off its head .
tr	1	Good all was going according to plan and it was down to fine-tuning .
tr	4	Once we were at their mercy he , would be in total control .
tr	2	Captain , order those ships to follow you into the harbor . "
tr	1	I asked , " Gerald are you willing to try it ? "
tr	4	Connie had become my life without her there would be no future left to me .
tr	1	I wandered slowly back to our cabin and set on the bunk .
tr	2	I took Connie 's nightgown in my bloody hands put it to my face .
tr	0	Connie had arrived and was undergoing surgery that was all we knew .
tr	1	I said , " Sure wish Dennis had done something about those damned guns . "
tr	0	I said , " I have to try that was a brave thing she did .
tr	1	I 'm going alone so I won 't put anyone else in danger . "
tr	4	Sam was holding the wrench and screwdriver trying to keep the line from leaking .
tr	1	" God damn you Jim don 't be risking my fucking ship . "
tr	3	Connie said , " Maybe I 'd better start watching you . "
tr	4	Jim asked me to let him know when I wished to take over command .
tr	0	I said , Thanks , Jim you have the bridge and walked off .
tr	4	With Pisces replenished , we were ready to work our way down the chain .
tr	1	We encountered people just barely hanging on to life living in appalling conditions .
tr	0	He had prepared for such an eventuality and had the parts on board .
tr	0	Dennis had gone ashore and made a search but had found no threats .
tr	2	He asked , " What do you reckon is going on . "
tr	0	I said , " Has to be the southern half of Vella 's Navy ? "
tr	3	Sam and I agreed it was worth the risk to check them out .
tr	2	I said , " Flesh and blood girl you have my solemn promise . "
tr	2	It took us over two hours and a lot of bailing to reach our destination .
tr	1	He said in a low , excited voice , " GW quick . "
tr	0	Sam had the glasses and was giving a play-by-play of the goings on .
tr	0	Sam went aboard , and I passed the fuel and battery up to him .
tr	3	It was a statement I had to admit reflected my sentiments exactly .
tr	4	He cut the last line I rammed the gearshift in forward and opened the throttle .
tr	2	It took us less than an hour to get back to Connie and Joyce .
tr	4	We could now take full advantage of the light breeze and I took the helm .
tr	2	I way praying some of my contacts had come through the Collapse .
tr	2	I hollered for Sam , who was by this time back on the dock .
tr	0	He said , " Yeah but they also say ... satisfaction brought it back .
tr	3	She said , " Don 't tell me you 're starting too . "
tr	1	I said , " No it 's strictly medicinal in my case . "
tr	1	She answered , " That 's strictly for medicinal purposes too ... .
tr	0	I 'm a captain in the US Coast Guard at present ... .
tr	1	I said , " Belize looks like it came through all right . "
tr	3	He said , " A Bright mon he wants to talk to you . "
tr	4	and handed the mike to me , " Allan , George Collins here . "
tr	2	I told the group Pisces was on the way and would be here tomorrow .
tr	4	we sat in the cockpit till almost midnight before sleep overcame the excitement .
tr	0	We walked back to the boat in silence digesting what Allan had said .
tr	0	Morals are iffy , and especially iffy when vast sums of money are at stake .
tr	4	They can continue using their renewed vigor and low-interest rates to formulate the next bubble .
tr	4	Viewers are able to see behind this disingenuous façade and realize they are being manipulated .
tr	3	I wouldn 't be surprised to find that we have already surpassed that point .
tr	1	Illegal immigration is the same we have no idea who is coming into the country .
tr	4	We are encouraging this type of immigration for only one reason , greed .
tr	1	This ban on profiling makes me sick , it has become a fiasco .
tr	3	They would tell me the stupid things the company did from time to time .
tr	1	You cannot be successful manufacturing a product you don 't like or believe in .
tr	1	It is conceivable this will trigger a cascade leading to worldwide famine .
tr	1	You have twelve whole years in which accomplish this failure is not an option .
tr	3	Its personal its part of me and it 's just the way it is .
tr	1	The main thing holding us up I believe is the oil lobby .
tr	0	We as humans are at our best when we set and work towards goals .
tr	1	I hadn 't heard any more about it until I began writing this paper .
tr	1	I reasoned if species could unknowingly evolve into partnerships then why not humans .
tr	3	That nature with her infinite patients has and is behind the scenes pulling the strings .
tr	1	It brings to mind the passage " God made man in his own image . "
tr	1	His eyesight was just adequate as was his hearing and sense of smell .
tr	4	He was forced through necessity to improve his environment first finding then later building shelter .
tr	4	She hasn 't been beaten and behind the scenes , remains in charge .
tr	1	This step is both logical and necessary as we go forward into interstellar space .
tr	2	This e-book may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	2	She gazed at him fondly , middle aged now but still strong and proud .
tr	1	the hot sun marching across the sky as it did every day .
tr	3	he thought , " the bloody walls are still hot from yesterday . "
tr	0	Her hair was long and jet black , hanging below her waist .
tr	3	She did not boast of her accomplishments just stated them as fact .
tr	0	" As you know sir it was a ' Claret ' operation .
tr	0	" Gem you know we keep a radio watch on Radio Jakarta ? "
tr	2	" God , I 'm a long way from Hereford , " he thought .
tr	3	he thought , " it 's just rumor , propaganda ... ... .
tr	4	not sure if everyone likes them that much but time will tell .
tr	2	We 're also well into the training of a new group of Border Scouts . "
tr	1	She gives us insights that we probably couldn 't see for ourselves .
tr	0	Dickie hung up the phone thinking on what the Colonel had had to say .
tr	2	Mason stood up and paced over to the window ... ... thinking .
tr	2	" If you roped in you could take one of those new radios .
tr	2	Hopefully they 'll get lucky , save us a lot of agro .
tr	2	He wanted to reach out and hold her but didn 't dare .
tr	0	He shook his head , the native girl and the British Officer ... ... .
tr	2	Tomorrow draw your kit ... ... check out your own chutes ... . .
tr	3	Is it going to get ugly or is it just much ado about nothing ?
tr	4	Gema 's in the outer office insisting she see you straight away ... . .
tr	2	" Nooooo , " she was looking over his shoulder ... ... . .
tr	3	" OK fellas the truck 's outside , let 's get it on . "
tr	4	The silence was shattered as he started up the two Pratt and Whitney engines .
tr	0	Harry was back in a few minutes , suddenly appearing at their sides .
tr	2	questioned Robbie in his broad Glasgow accent , " two on watch ... . .
tr	3	" Robbie , you and I take the first watch ... . .
tr	4	you gents get some kip , " whispered George , " and Harry ... . .
tr	3	They moved on to the body at the foot of the steps .
tr	2	Wendy would be leaving soon , heading off to Cambridge on a scholarship .
tr	0	They were mostly army friends from when he was stationed in Malaya and Sarawak .
tr	0	She was tall , unlike her mother , easily as tall as he was .
tr	0	She had an ear for languages and was already multi-lingual ... . .
tr	4	George has done better than any of us since we all retired .
tr	2	Well good on him I say , bloody good golfer too . "
tr	3	He 'd actually tried it for a while but got bored to death ... .
tr	3	The slamming of the front door brought him back to the present .
tr	4	she asked , " I 'm expecting something from the travel agents . "
tr	4	After her family had been killed Gema had never been quite the same .
tr	4	" This will not be like before , where we are going is different .
tr	2	" Wendy ... ... from tomorrow on you must do everything I say ... . .
tr	2	According to Robbie they would not know him but he would know them .
tr	2	They followed him to a four wheel drive obviously provided by Robbie .
tr	1	It looked like a relic from the sixties ... ... an ex-military Champion .
tr	1	" This will get their attention , " he said in Malay , laughing .
tr	1	pack on his back ... rifle strapped to his chest ... . .
tr	4	He was genuine but he made her sad , he reminded her of what was .
tr	1	Mac will know where I am , I will guide you . "
tr	1	" Six iron 'll probably do it , " he thought reaching into his bag .
tr	0	enough for Harry to have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse .
tr	4	although there never seemed to be too much for him to do .
tr	1	His wife Judy was killed in a hit and run while jogging one morning .
tr	3	not to die for his country but to make the other bastard die for his .
tr	4	He threw himself into his work sometimes working twenty hours a day .
tr	4	Suddenly he was a wealthy man but nothing could replace the loss of Judy .
tr	1	Shit some of them are working for you in Brunei , " said Harry .
tr	1	He drew on the cigar until it was burning evenly and looked around him .
tr	2	Of course you can buy yourself into anything today and he certainly could afford it .
tr	1	He paid his taxes and contributed to charities of his choice ... ... .
tr	3	" Here 's your competition I was just giving them the two quid tour .
tr	4	" I got ta pee before we go to the tenth , " said George .
tr	1	if he 's from Viet Nam I 'll blow you in the bar ! "
tr	1	She knew that within her was a simmering anger but didn 't know why .
tr	1	Sometimes she 'd wake up in the morning angry and not know why .
tr	3	He just didn 't get it , far too cerebral for him .
tr	3	He 'd just brush it off and tell her not to worry about it .
tr	1	Her multi-lingual skills landed her a position with an international translation company .
tr	0	He adamantly refused , got angry with her , saw it as a personal attack .
tr	0	He 'd won his match which was all he was concerned about .
tr	0	The barman , leaning over the bar talking to a known local pimp .
tr	3	" Damn I 've forgotten the invitation , need that to get in . " "
tr	1	I 'll get it , " she said , " where is it ? "
tr	0	" Where the hell would he have put it , " she thought .
tr	2	She had to hold on to the desk to stop herself falling .
tr	3	She tried not to panic exerting self control that was almost unnatural .
tr	4	We 'll be there in less than half an hour , " he said .
tr	1	Good turnout I think , " replied Dick , his eyes quickly scanning the room .
tr	2	" He also said not to forget what he told you . "
tr	2	It was as though she was looking down on it ... . .
tr	2	We could have left two hours ago and no one would have noticed . "
tr	2	Gema shook her head in exasperation ... and thought of Wendy at school .
tr	1	Tony sat in his favorite chair in his club feeling particularly pleased with himself .
tr	4	Dressed in jeans and Chelsea Football Club jacket he fitted in well with the crowds .
tr	4	Once he walked into a department store and out of a different door .
tr	3	" The belly , " he thought , " that 's the weak point .
tr	3	Tony took a head butt , aimed at the bridge of his nose .
tr	3	The crowd wasn 't happy but Tony had other things to do tonight .
tr	3	Firstly I don 't want to get them locally and secondly ... .
tr	0	It 's a Pay as you Go number so it can 't be traced .
tr	0	didn 't think I was that popular ' round here anyway . "
tr	1	Closing the door behind him and noticing that it closed with a satisfying clunk .
tr	3	It must have been pretty important to bring him all the way down from Leeds .
tr	3	that tends to cut through the red tape and gets people 's attention . "
tr	2	A career cop although you wouldn 't know just looking at her .
tr	2	She 'd had the occasional date but nothing serious according to station gossip .
tr	2	" We have a killing out at the Belmont Lodge Golf Club .
tr	2	" Our first foursome of the day found him , " said the pro .
tr	4	There were several police and two para medics close to the bunker .
tr	3	Without an ID we can do virtually nothing , let 's get on it ! "
tr	4	We 've sent blood samples down to the Forensic Science Service in London .
tr	3	It wasn 't much later in the day that they received a fax from London .
tr	1	" OK , out with it , David , it is David isn 't it ?
tr	1	Truth is I was a bad boy by my boss 's standards .
tr	1	Tony sat in his Brixton office looking at the unidentifiable fax in front of him .
tr	3	" Expensive stuff , what they going to do , start a bloody war ?
tr	3	Only place to get this stuff is a military armory , " he thought .
tr	1	" Do I call or just drive up to Worcester and surprise him ?
tr	2	He took a number from his personal phone book and dialed it directly .
tr	0	" Dave I want you to take a look at a guy in Worcester .
tr	0	There was already a team staking out the store and a tap on the phone .
tr	1	He smiled grimly , " I thought you said it was quiet round here ! "
tr	1	Whilst she was out of the room David did a quick circuit .
tr	4	" After Harry left the army he opened a martial arts school here in Gloucester .
tr	0	" Marjorie , if I may call you that , " said David .
tr	1	Jennie asked the standard questions about known enemies and strangers hanging around .
tr	3	" They won 't hurt you , " a tall gentleman standing in the doorway .
tr	2	" Yes , I sort of rattle around in it on my own .
tr	2	Just the one troop working out of Kuching , four teams of four chaps each .
tr	1	" I own a security company , we specialize in oil field security .
tr	2	" Got ta be off , " she said , " love your house . "
tr	1	* " There is a connection you know , " said Jennie .
tr	1	She and David were sitting in a corner alcove in the Dragon comparing notes .
tr	2	* It wasn 't raining but it would soon , a dull , gloomy day .
tr	4	The house seemed very empty to him what with Wendy being at Cambridge .
tr	2	You go to the golf course , I go to the gym or the dojo .
tr	2	She got up and walked over to the window overlooking the courtyard .
tr	2	" I 'm going to move into the barn ... ... ... . .
tr	0	If you want to go ahead and have an affair go right ahead ... . .
tr	4	Inside a modern kitchen and bathroom with ten foot ceilings , the bedroom the same .
tr	4	" It better be good , I was asleep , " she muttered .
tr	1	" Yea right , " said David grinning , " so what 's up ? "
tr	2	David dialed the building on Gower St. and was connected to the Commander .
tr	1	I 'm part of the Counter Terrorist Squad currently working out of Hereford .
tr	1	They 'd both been in Malaya and Borneo and seen jungle action .
tr	4	" Jennie it is then , " he said , " call me George . "
tr	2	She looked at David ... David said , " Harry was poisoned .
tr	1	The lighting was subdued except for the individual spotlights highlighting certain items on the walls .
tr	1	Feel the balance of this thing , " he said , handing it to David .
tr	0	and their basket weaving , " he said nodding at several hanging on the wall .
tr	1	I like him but then again we have a lot in common .
tr	4	They were driving back to Hereford both seemingly lost in their thoughts .
tr	3	" After all it 's not costing me anything so why should I bother ? "
tr	2	You spoke to me of many things and I have not forgotten . "
tr	2	but it looks as though she doesn 't have any clothes on . "
tr	4	" I don 't see why that would be a problem Dave .
tr	1	Tons of circumstantial evidence but nothing we can really move on ... .
tr	0	Having missed her customary two days off Jennie was taking the day off .
tr	2	I periodically drive down to Bristol , to a gun club down there .
tr	1	" Just come as you are Jennie it 's just a gun club . "
tr	1	" I 'm just wearing a tee shirt , " she said laughing .
tr	2	" No it 's OK , George , I 'll drive down to Eaton Bishop .
tr	1	Frank took his time , rarely going over sixty miles per hour .
tr	0	" How many do they want Frank and what are they ? "
tr	3	Let 's get back into town , we 've still time for another pint . "
tr	1	I still think he might go off on his own a bit .
tr	2	You 'll have to show some form of identification " he said almost apologetically .
tr	2	" I would think my warrant card should be enough don 't you ? "
tr	2	I also brought you a shotgun which should fit you too . "
tr	3	that 's if you want to bring me , " she said quietly .
tr	3	After putting the shotguns away he took out two locked steel cases .
tr	2	Glad I did too , " he added smiling at her frown .
tr	1	They sat , in companionable silence , watching the fire burn down .
tr	3	The two of them sat there gazing into the fire now burning down .
tr	1	Pulling his directory up on his laptop he dialed a number in Belfast .
tr	0	Get hold of him on his mobile ... ... he might need a hand .
tr	4	I have to interview her but she 's been out of the country . "
tr	0	Now , what the hell is he doing with the IRA ? "
tr	4	She noticed that although still tanned he had tired lines around his eyes .
tr	0	I know for a fact she had a lot of trouble back here in England .
tr	1	Dickie says she 's some sort of ' master ' or something .
tr	4	You remember when you were looking at that stuff in the ' museum ' ?
tr	0	She was not able to add anything to what they already knew .
tr	3	" Yes but what 's that got to do with anything ? "
tr	4	She sat opposite David and George in an alcove in the snug .
tr	3	She started to blush heavily with embarrassment and turned back towards the door .
tr	2	" Do you want the short or the long of it Jennie ? "
tr	2	She was over here with her daughter not so long ago you know .
tr	3	Just traditional blankets and prayer mats ... ... stuff like that . "
tr	2	" Judy ... it 's time for me to move on now .
tr	1	Our most successful charity is the collection of Christmas gifts for the needy .
tr	3	St. Mary 's not being in the center of town was a distinct advantage .
tr	1	" fact is I haven 't done it since Judy died . "
tr	2	" So , George , who 's coming over for Xmas ? "
tr	0	As Quartermaster Sergeant he had a lot of contact with local suppliers .
tr	2	Paddy glanced at the full laundry hampers and decided it was time .
tr	0	With a ' Merry Xmas ' he climbed back into the cab and drove away .
tr	3	If it 's that bad why don 't they just split up , period ? "
tr	1	Frank Jennings sat in his black van behind St. Mary 's church .
tr	2	The room looked new and was obviously part of a recent addition .
tr	2	Five thousand rounds took him over a dozen trips to the truck .
tr	3	It was scheduled to stay this way until after the New Year .
tr	1	Both were carrying back packs and Uzi sub machine guns strapped across their chests .
tr	3	They had four minutes to get out as much as they could carry .
tr	4	By the time the protocols had all been followed the six were long gone .
tr	3	Bit too isolated for me ... ... but it has its uses . "
tr	2	Jimmy took a notebook out of his jacket pocket and an old fashioned fountain pen .
tr	1	" Pick him up there 's a good chap , " said Jimmy quietly .
tr	4	The attack on Tern Hill had been relegated to the third page in The Times .
tr	3	His greatest concern was that this had something to do with Jennings .
tr	2	If to China , same thing ... ... he wouldn 't live too long .
tr	0	* It was exactly a week since the attack on Clive Barracks .
tr	4	He could hear footsteps behind him , somebody younger , faster catching him up .
tr	3	He turned down towards the canal , his favorite part of the run .
tr	0	He ran by a line of canal boats all tucked up for the winter .
tr	2	" Don 't worry Tony , I 'm calling from a call box . "
tr	3	" Well , " he said " lots of activity in the last few days .
tr	2	The Commander took a sip of his drink and looked over at George .
tr	3	The last thing we need is some innocent to get caught up in it !
tr	2	OK , here 's how I propose we go about this . "
tr	3	The Commander stood up and started to walk about the room lost in thought .
tr	2	There 's also a bit of a turn up for the book ... ... . .
tr	2	should bring them all up to London , puts the pressure on .
tr	1	Jennings is on the move now and should arrive in about ninety minutes .
tr	1	You and I will take him , that OK with you David ? "
tr	3	" Jennings is about ten minutes out , " said the Captain tersely .
tr	2	David took out his pocket knife and sliced open one of the cardboard boxes .
tr	2	He pulled off the cardboard box to reveal a military looked ammunition box .
tr	4	" These are some of the weapons stolen from Clive Barracks recently .
tr	2	Avi and his group , plus the eight illegals , are all in custody .
tr	2	" Any objections to me coming up to London on Friday as well ? "
tr	0	It all seemed so far away from what she did for a living ... ... .
tr	0	He was a huge man , in his forties now but still lean and hard .
tr	2	Many of them would not know what to do , you know , after retirement .
tr	0	" So what have you guys been talking about behind my back ? "
tr	3	that 's the Border Scout I was telling you about Jennie ... . .
tr	4	She must have a museum like yours George , " he said jokingly .
tr	1	Everyone should show up around lunchtime and dinner should be around four I think . "
tr	2	Good bonus this year too , they 're on the company payroll of course . "
tr	1	She sat for a few minutes , gazing into the fire thinking .
tr	0	Roast turkey , a separate pan of walnut stuffing , bread pudding .
tr	4	It was years since he had seen Gema and Wendy he 'd never actually met .
tr	2	I 've known your mother for over twenty years now ... ... .
tr	2	Gema whispered and turned away to be introduced to David and Pauline .
tr	4	Both her and Gema seemed to spend a lot of time talking with Robbie .
tr	4	" You 're not wearing a tee shirt , " he whispered .
tr	2	I 'll fill you all in after you 've all made yourself at home here .
tr	1	Jennie took his hand and turned to him , tears shining in her eyes .
tr	3	As predicted the Land Rover took the road conditions in its stride .
tr	1	Driving up the High Road towards Barnet George turned the radio off .
tr	3	they 'll be working within the law and staying within the confines of the property .
tr	2	Of course I could also be totally wrong and I hope I am . "
tr	3	" There are certain criteria but that 's what makes them attractive on the market .
tr	4	The door silently closed behind them and self locked with an audible set of clicks .
tr	4	Suffice it to say we have enough to put you away for several lifetimes .
tr	1	" Our interest is the murders of Harry Downer and Peter Brenner . "
tr	4	" See those are the pics I just took ... ... . .
tr	4	He needed a shave and a shower but couldn 't be bothered .
tr	1	He found himself in his bedroom looking into his full length dressing mirror .
tr	2	The two rows of theatre ribbons looked colorful against the dark blue background .
tr	1	He found photos of Gema and himself taken in and around Kuching .
tr	1	He worked the slider ... ... it still operated with a satisfying click .
tr	0	He quickly dressed , put on a white camouflage suit and balaclava .
tr	1	It had snowed again , lying on the ground muffling any sounds he might make .
tr	4	There were boot prints leading away to the east following the line of the fence .
tr	4	He remembered wondering why he hadn 't heard anything before the blackness overcame him .
tr	1	He wanted to see Dick to warn him of what his intuition was telling him .
tr	4	It certainly looks like a suicide but we can 't be sure . "
tr	3	She struggled to get the sight of Dick Mason out of her mind .
tr	3	" Nothing yet but the Commander is on the job ... ... . .
tr	1	He was looking forward to putting his feet up and spending time with his dogs .
tr	2	" I had my phone off for a while Rob ... ... .
tr	1	Nasty bruise on the side of his head but he 's a tough old bastard .
tr	1	I was in ' B ' troop in the ' Regiment ' . "
tr	2	" Some bastard jumped me in the woods down by the paddock ... . .
tr	2	" OK ... ... you stay where you are at least until tomorrow .
tr	3	Apparently the problem is not with the oil company itself but more with the Sultan .
tr	0	" What the hell is going on here , " he said thickly .
tr	4	The old timers said it reminded them of the winter of forty seven .
tr	4	He and Margaret had moved back into the Lodge down by the estate entrance .
tr	1	Either she 's no intention of coming back or she doesn 't know when . "
tr	3	Sitting in the living room she looked around startled by what she saw .
tr	2	" No ... nothing of the sort , why would I do that ?
tr	2	When would be convenient for you , how 's tomorrow morning first thing ? "
tr	1	Her hair was short but auburn not black like her mother 's .
tr	2	The air was full of lively chatter mostly in Malay ... . .
tr	0	' Airport Arrivals ' always seems to be such a happy place she thought .
tr	3	It was still not yet lunchtime as the flight from Malaya had not taken long .
tr	2	" I 'm so sorry but Mr. McElroy is out of the country just now .
tr	3	I have often wondered about that after that first time with Gema .
tr	1	He got me an Indonesian passport and brought me to Brunei ... . .
tr	3	she asked , " for that matter what am I doing here too ? "
tr	1	" I will have no part in this , I 'm leaving now .
tr	2	Jennie stood up and took up a position in front of the door .
tr	4	" I think it 's common knowledge in this room that we were estranged .
tr	4	In fact they 'll be there by the time you get home .
tr	1	Sorry for the inconvenience as they 'll be looking in every nook and cranny .
tr	0	" I could stay at Wendy 's flat in London for a few days .
tr	2	Do me good to get away from here for a while anyway . "
tr	1	She 's very bright , speaks five languages fluently and is as hard as nails .
tr	3	Apparently it 's very old , originated in the fifth or sixth century .
tr	2	There was no room to park in the Mason 's cobbled yard .
tr	1	" I told you what it was like George didn 't I ? "
tr	4	Certainly not out of place in Indonesia , I 've seen them myself ... .
tr	0	" I had a bit of a brainstorm on the way home .
tr	4	What I do believe is that you can help us clear up this mess .
tr	1	I told him , to his face , I thought he was Indonesian . "
tr	2	" You going to stay in town or come out to Eaton Bishop ? "
tr	0	" I thought you hadn 't finished the search of the Mason 's yet ? "
tr	1	The village has a military history which is why I know it so well .
tr	2	" Hang on a minute George my phone 's going , no bloody peace ! "
tr	4	" Hi it 's David , where the hell are you ? "
tr	1	One of the uniforms found something tying Gema Mason to Brenner and Downer .
tr	4	" George would she have known who comprised the rest of the team ? "
tr	2	As I sit here looking at these photos there is another common denominator ... .
tr	2	The Commander stood up and looked more closely at the photos on the wall .
tr	0	She is also a Grand Master in Silat a deadly form of martial arts .
tr	1	She was brought up on stories of tribal battles and clan feuds .
tr	2	" You pick it up Robbie ... it 's probably Bandar . "
tr	2	She could 've walked out of the back door for all I know . "
tr	3	They must be following me ... but why go to the trouble ?
tr	1	" Why don 't I pick you up in the morning then ? "
tr	4	He almost didn 't recognize her when she walked out of the Tube station .
tr	4	" The question is ... where the hell did she go ... and why ?
tr	2	If you try to get out of the car I will shoot you .
tr	4	They were back in their favorite room with Robbie and the dogs .
tr	0	When David shows up I 'll have him talk to the Commander .
tr	1	Now she 's in the wind and knows she 's been on camera .
tr	2	Nothing to lose really , mission accomplished ... ... ... ... almost . "
tr	3	Eventually she turned south on the Banbury Road with only another twenty minutes to go .
tr	3	You will sit quietly in that seat until I tell you to move .
tr	3	Leaning against the kitchen counter she threw two plastic ties into his lap .
tr	4	" Tie your ankles to the chair legs , " she said conversationally .
tr	3	With difficulty she heaved Tony on the chair into the centre of the tarp .
tr	4	Now we 'll have some tea , we 've had a rather exciting day . "
tr	3	He couldn 't help but gasp at the sight of her magnificent body .
tr	0	He could almost hear the drum that was obviously sounding in her head .
tr	0	He had refused anything to eat and the stink of fear was around him .
tr	3	That question was answered the moment I saw the photograph of your hands .
tr	2	That is me my brother , thanks to your dishonor I am your only relative !
tr	3	Blood spurted up out of his neck to be caught by the tarp .
tr	2	said George , " or do we just go in guns blazing ? "
tr	3	The magnificent room was softly lit by the lamps in the corners .
tr	4	The expanse of teak floor gleamed like it had been recently oiled .
tr	4	She had placed the pistol in her mouth and pulled the trigger .
tr	1	So it 'll be back to business as usual I think . "
tr	3	" I was going to talk to you about that , " he said .
tr	3	Maybe we could do that little run down by the waterfall ? "
tr	2	Slowly the silence was broken by the roar of the waterfall in full flood .
tr	3	The pain of the stitch bent him over as he came to a standstill .
tr	4	He thought of Jen and his dogs and knew he would never see them again .
tr	0	at least the sun was shining and he could hear the blackbirds .
tr	2	This e book may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	1	Especially Ena Murray a well known South African writer through my growing years .
tr	0	The look of disdain from the captain towards the blond sailor was undeniably menacing .
tr	3	The chatter of the little girl was interesting to say the least .
tr	4	She was not happy , even if she was married to the rich merchant .
tr	1	How many times have I wished for a wife and child of my own ?
tr	3	At first he was reluctant to encourage her , tending to his work at hand .
tr	4	Even when she called out to him he did not look at her .
tr	2	For a few seconds I could only enjoy the lady in my arms .
tr	3	† † † September 17 , 1621 What is that woman up to ?
tr	3	I saw the disappointment , the hurt on the lady 's face .
tr	0	† † † September 19 , 1621 Today was an unpleasant day on the ship .
tr	3	I wanted to offer him water at least but another sailor stopped me .
tr	2	I had to , before I would finally let go of him .
tr	4	He did not conceal the look of love as he whispered my name .
tr	3	But when I tried to get Cisco 's attention he refused to look at me .
tr	0	Cisco disappeared and Faro went back to the Captain 's cabin , no doubt .
tr	4	† † † September 22 , 1621 I cannot believe what I saw today .
tr	3	For a long time I sat next to him and watched as he slept .
tr	4	The motion of the ship where more fierce than what we are used to .
tr	4	He stood in the enormous foyer of the castle and gaped in awe .
tr	4	He struggled for words this morning , but accepted the responsibilities as property owner .
tr	3	It took us a while to get him back in the house .
tr	4	The lone figure of a young woman looked over the vast blue sea .
tr	4	At the tender age of eighteen , he was already a leader .
tr	1	Not knowing his whereabouts was difficult but they could only remain calm , waiting .
tr	2	The months of waiting in anticipation of Pedro had been too long .
tr	4	Finally , standing before her father , he handed him a letter .
tr	1	With shaking hands he said , " Cisco , my dear friend . "
tr	2	" I don 't know how to give this news to you . "
tr	2	I don 't know if I will be able to tell you .
tr	1	" Yes , it is Pedro , and I hope he is still alive .
tr	4	When Franco called his name , his ears perked to full attention .
tr	2	The cloth fell on the floor and a dark stain formed , unnoticed .
tr	1	" His second-in-command is his son , a ruthless and cunning man .
tr	0	I am a land owner , married to the most beautiful woman in the world .
tr	1	Cisco was like a child , riding his horse all over the place .
tr	1	Cisco turned to Captain Jean , still holding his wife around the shoulders .
tr	4	She walked out , the anger she felt earlier building up inside of her .
tr	0	Her father had taught her the skill of the pistol and the sword .
tr	0	I have heard many things about this pirate and Isle of Saint Marie .
tr	0	Finally , when it was already late that evening , Father reluctantly gave in .
tr	3	" Trust that what you have taught me will save me and Pedro . "
tr	4	The abuse they had suffered under him had made him easy to forget .
tr	0	I did not care what any one said as long as she was safe .
tr	0	He is a big man , taller and more bulky than most .
tr	4	She bravely smiled at her family and they held her for a moment in silence .
tr	0	Wood creaking , the ship started to sail away from the harbour .
tr	2	Enrico nodded his head in understanding and walked out , closing the door behind him .
tr	2	Not suitable for a woman , but for this voyage it would do fine .
tr	0	She was busy brushing her long hair when she heard a knock .
tr	1	His voice cold , while his eyes took in the interior of the cabin .
tr	0	The man is wild among the women , usually , taking what he wants .
tr	3	Something about little Pedro 's sister is of interest to the captain .
tr	3	It just may be the man has met his match with this young woman .
tr	0	No , this one is defiant , a real wild cat , as Roberto says .
tr	1	Yes , this will be an interesting time , with the stunning woman on board .
tr	3	Kayla , of course , used this time to get to him , I thought .
tr	1	I trust him with everything because I know his love is unchanging .
tr	4	She , however , did not notice the stare or the shift .
tr	0	She could hear his laugh following her all the way to her door .
tr	3	Walking to the bow , a man busy with ropes looked at her with interest .
tr	4	He was a loving , gentle giant , and she loved him fiercely .
tr	4	She acknowledged their gesture with a simple nod of the head and sat down .
tr	4	When she was almost done with the meal she heard the captain addressing her .
tr	4	There was a sadness on her face and Roberto wondered about it .
tr	1	He even imagined a few children running around , enjoying the fruit of his labour .
tr	0	It was the only way that he could help his parents and save the farm .
tr	4	He only enjoyed them for a while and then threw them to his men .
tr	3	It left me sick to my stomach and brought back memories best forgotten .
tr	1	He learns fast and with Franco guiding him I know he can only succeed .
tr	2	My loyalty and love belonged to Cisco , but I was still married to Faro .
tr	0	My beauty had faded , my skin was like sandpaper and darker than normal .
tr	3	I cried , not caring about the people and what they might say .
tr	0	The fact that he asked her to walk with him shocked her the most .
tr	4	If she did not know better , she would have thought that they were alone .
tr	0	His hands clasped behind his back , he could hear her struggling for control .
tr	0	" My name is Roberto , not Captain , " he said with a chuckle .
tr	2	Cisco is a joy to watch as he carries the infant from room to room .
tr	2	Sails appeared on the horizon , coming closer with each passing hour .
tr	3	" What is wrong with the ship you plan to escort ? "
tr	2	We will be off so that you can continue with your voyage . "
tr	1	" Not in her cabin , Captain , " Enrico replied cautiously .
tr	3	But she would not listen to him and he could not lie to this man .
tr	0	† † † June 11 , 1624 Kayla came for a short visit .
tr	2	In Africa you learn to think on your feet and use the tools you have .
tr	0	All finesse and veneer is stripped away and all that is left is survival .
tr	4	There was trouble with other land owners and they had held meetings the week before .
tr	1	It irritated him greatly since it took him away from his home and family .
tr	0	Cisco said that Alfonso was shocked and turned his attentions away from any woman .
tr	3	With not much to do but hope that she would not betray them .
tr	2	Pierre tried to talk to him but Roberto was not in a conversational mood .
tr	3	" Roberto , don 't you think we must turn away ? "
tr	4	When Roberto crawled over the railing onto the deck , all was quiet .
tr	3	They would have to move swiftly and not draw any attention toward themselves .
tr	4	Some men were in a drunken stupor , others slept because of exhaustion .
tr	4	He made sure that his eyes were accustomed to the dark before he moved further .
tr	3	He could not speak to Pierre at this moment because they would attract attention .
tr	4	" Yes , I looked around while you were on the lower deck .
tr	1	But he is convinced Manuel understands him and continues with the lessons .
tr	1	His imagination was running wild with things he wanted to do to her .
tr	4	His menacing eyes piercing through her made her fearful of the man dressed in black .
tr	2	" Captain , did you find the man you were looking for ? "
tr	2	She could do nothing but wait once again for a moment to slip away .
tr	4	Enrico came into sight and offered her some water , helping her sip it .
tr	3	" Please , Roberto , I know I am at fault , but listen .
tr	3	" I am not interested in anything you have to say at the moment .
tr	0	He was the captain and he ran the ship as he saw fit .
tr	1	Pierre raised his voice to his captain and he raised a dark brow in question .
tr	0	This was a lady and you did not treat a lady like that .
tr	1	Roberto asked stoically , eyebrows raised , his hands on his hips .
tr	3	" She told me something that you need to know , Captain . "
tr	2	Roberto bit hard down on his jaw ; he could not afford to be soft .
tr	1	She was hiding , hoping to get away as soon as possible .
tr	4	When she lifted her eyes to glance at him , he could only see relief .
tr	0	She had really thought that he was going to go through with his plan .
tr	4	Roberto had never made her feel like that , neither him nor his crew .
tr	1	" I like her , " Pierre said with a wide-open grin .
tr	0	" She 's right , we can catch up the way she said . "
tr	4	When I finally woke I looked for her and saw her crying .
tr	3	Angry for the situation we were in and that I could not change it . "
tr	4	Deep in thought , he slipped into it , her warmth captured inside .
tr	0	He had seen how Roberto looked at her when he thought nobody was watching .
tr	4	She was the picture of a stunning female , now more than before .
tr	3	" At this rate we will catch up in time , " Roberto thought .
tr	0	How could he put her back , knowing what he had just discovered ?
tr	4	All eyes were on him , the food forgotten , as they waited .
tr	0	Reluctantly , Roberto had to agree to the plan and finally said : " Okay .
tr	3	She clearly had put a lot of thought into it and they could win .
tr	4	He knew he was acting childlike but he could not help himself .
tr	3	He was the only man Roberto trusted to protect her at all costs .
tr	3	Roberto thought his heart was going to stop at the sight of her .
tr	3	To think that he gave in to the plan was utter madness .
tr	0	Roberto almost had a heart attack when he saw her at first .
tr	3	To display her attributes before other men was not good at all .
tr	2	Your fame precedes you , and your second in command is a worthy opponent . "
tr	4	They were taken down below , where they would be tried and immediately hung .
tr	3	It was so quick that I thought I was dreaming , but here you are !
tr	0	For eight days I was a captive in that dresser with no way of escape .
tr	4	No matter how she tried she could not ignore the feelings he stirred .
tr	0	" I am so sorry , my good captain , my manners are unforgivable .
tr	3	His glance at her bosom irritated Roberto but he could not fault the man .
tr	4	From his place in the water he could not help but to admire her .
tr	3	He was the only man Roberto trusted to protect her at all costs .
tr	3	Roberto thought his heart was going to stop at the sight of her .
tr	3	To think that he gave in to the plan was utter madness .
tr	0	Roberto almost had a heart attack when he saw her at first .
tr	3	To display her attributes before other men was not good at all .
tr	2	Your fame precedes you , and your second in command is a worthy opponent . "
tr	4	Several minutes later , the voice of the real captain roared over the deck .
tr	3	It was so quick that I thought I was dreaming , but here you are !
tr	0	For eight days I was a captive in that dresser with no way of escape .
tr	0	" I am so sorry , my good captain , my manners are unforgivable .
tr	3	His glance at her bosom irritated Roberto but he could not fault the man .
tr	4	Her brother 's shirt had covered her chest and only her back had been bared .
tr	2	The cabin was too confining and small for her to breathe properly .
tr	3	His strength and fitness attracted her so that she openly stared at him .
tr	3	First , he looked lonely and sad and that attracted me to him .
tr	1	However , without me knowing it , I put him in danger .
tr	0	At first , the captain said it was okay because my mother was upset .
tr	4	" After the storm and the shipwreck we landed on a strip of white sand .
tr	4	The captain refused to take care of them and left them behind .
tr	3	After that , he found stray dogs , grilled them and forced us to eat .
tr	2	By his calculations , we had to be close to a fort .
tr	3	At that point , they did not care that my biological father was still around .
tr	2	The group decided they would go with him and not stay behind .
tr	2	The governor was good to us and helped us to get on our feet again .
tr	4	Father stepped in when he heard her scream for help and saved her .
tr	2	" Why do you say that your biological father wanted to rape your mother ?
tr	0	Waves higher than the ship fell on them all with crushing strength .
tr	4	Men rushed over the deck as water ran like strong currents over the rolling deck .
tr	4	The concept emerged within his heart and he had no time to tell her .
tr	4	Shocked , he looked at the doctor but he squeezed his shoulder .
tr	3	He put a few stitches in the shoulder and bandaged it with a white cloth .
tr	0	Her face was bruised and swollen but the doctor assured him that would go away .
tr	2	" By allowing me to love you , " he said without thought .
tr	4	However , it does not change the fact that I have feelings for you .
tr	0	You always treat me with respect and I admire you for the captain you are .
tr	4	Again she looked at him , perplexed , allowing herself to enjoy the kiss .
tr	4	She closed her eyes , enjoying the closeness of him , her heart racing .
tr	2	" Thanks , Roberto , for taking such good care of me . "
tr	1	He said he wanted to discuss something and he was quite serious .
tr	4	Everyone knew his feelings , since he had confessed it loudly enough .
tr	4	And it had almost cost her life for him to recognize his feelings for her .
tr	1	His constant companionship convincing her that he was genuine in his feelings .
tr	0	What amazed her was that he did not care what the men said in passing .
tr	3	Still he did not speak about the thing he wanted to ask her .
tr	3	But still it kept her wakeful most nights , her feelings in turmoil .
tr	4	She and Pierre also developed a friendship under the vigilance of Roberto .
tr	4	His lips barely brushed her skin and the whole act left her breathless .
tr	0	I want to have a taste of that lady as much as you do . "
tr	1	His face was still stern but a muscle rippled in his jaw .
tr	0	He held both her hands in a firm grip , his tension real .
tr	4	She knew she cared for him , trusted him , but could it be love ?
tr	4	She looped her arm into his with a smile playing over her face .
tr	3	" Not against men like the Falcon and that pirate last night .
tr	1	" It is because of what I am , isn 't it ? "
tr	4	Rubies in the form of a rose were imbedded in the tiara .
tr	3	† † † Ten days later another storm hit the Contra O Vento .
tr	0	She could not fight the strength of the hands holding her tightly .
tr	4	He lowered his head to her breast , closing hungry lips around her .
tr	4	This was the first time she had been back in her old cabin .
tr	0	His rough hands stroking her thighs as he tore more fabric away .
tr	1	With a final effort she reached the pistol , bringing it into her hand .
tr	2	She did not mention it to Roberto though , the shock overwhelming her .
tr	4	The storm calmed down as men 's feet stopped running above them .
tr	4	Roberto could only hold her next to his drenched body while he caressed her .
tr	4	He made her stand up , stripping the wet dress from her .
tr	4	Eyes closed , she looked pale and tired as he watched her while stripping himself .
tr	2	" So far I am not doing a very fine job of it . "
tr	0	Taking deep breaths , she would not show him how much last night shook her .
tr	4	He pulled a cord and in a few seconds Enrico was at the door .
tr	2	" Should I bring your food here as well , Captain ? "
tr	4	the moment Enrico stepped out Roberto placed a kiss on her cheek and she smiled .
tr	1	The simple act was reassuring as the silk fell through his fingers .
tr	0	A book lay open next to an easy chair , worn out at the armrests .
tr	2	If you had not killed him one of them would have . "
tr	1	This time she comforted him , wrapping her arms around his waist .
tr	2	It would be so easy to love you , but your lifestyle , your choices .
tr	0	" My parents have a huge farm on the south coast of France .
tr	3	My father fell into debt and finally it was time to pay up .
tr	4	My sister and I were given as slaves to pay off the debt .
tr	3	It was the hardest thing my parents had to do but we understood . "
tr	4	Everyone knew what had happened to her and everyone made the connection .
tr	1	But she said no words as she listened to his life story .
tr	0	He looked at her with pleading , hoping that she would still love him .
tr	0	After a long battle and lives lost it was in our hands .
tr	4	" We would have never met if it was not for the ransom . "
tr	4	He swept her from her feet and onto the bed in record time .
tr	3	He stood up to light more lanterns and sat down again next to her .
tr	1	You are still very tired , " Roberto said , standing up .
tr	0	He held his arm out and she slipped her arm into his .
tr	3	They would talk and he would open more to her the things that were important .
tr	4	She always felt safe though , with Pierre and the rest of the crew .
tr	1	On occasion when alone her mind would drift to her parents left behind in Portugal .
tr	0	He knew that he had done the right thing to marry her .
tr	3	It was so much for her to trust him without knowing the truth .
tr	0	He was the only one that knew what this could cost him if he failed .
tr	3	The day quickly turned into night as thunderous black clouds formed in the sky .
tr	4	Exhausted , the men fell down and slept in shifts during this time .
tr	3	She had to get to the buttons to strip the wet clothes from his body .
tr	1	Her small hands were trying to roll him , pressing against his body .
tr	0	She arched toward him , his hand rough but yet soft on her bare skin .
tr	3	But he did want to assure her of a future with him .
tr	4	He kissed her palm and then her lips in a final good-bye .
tr	2	Now was a good time to determine what was wrong although he had his suspicions .
tr	2	Screams echoed from the large hut and Roberto could only guess what was going on .
tr	0	" Take her away , " he barked to no one in particular .
tr	3	Roberto sat down and watched with growing hatred the abuse to the young woman .
tr	1	The Falcon 's second , Tiny Forehand , came and sat next to him .
tr	2	Before she could pour the contents Roberto got up and took it from her .
tr	0	Roberto asked instead , and a smug grin appeared on the Falcon 's face .
tr	4	They had known him , enjoyed his lovemaking long before she was in the picture .
tr	3	After about fifteen minutes of walking through the throng , they came into a clearing .
tr	3	It will take more than that to break her , he thought .
tr	3	Five steps led up to the veranda without any railings around it .
tr	4	As they stepped onto the wooden deck , it creaked underneath their weight .
tr	0	He bandaged them with strips of his shirt under much protest from her .
tr	1	He wanted big , chubby women and showed off his own women standing behind him .
tr	3	" I said I would trust you , no matter what . "
tr	2	The doctor confirmed it two days ago , and I wanted to surprise you . "
tr	1	He lifted her in the air , twirling her around , laughter in his voice .
tr	3	Moonlight streamed in through the shutter slats so that they could make out anything inside .
tr	3	In the back corner of the wooden structure was a trap door that he lifted .
tr	0	They went through it quickly and he closed the door behind him .
tr	2	He motioned for her to go out and stay in the bushes close by .
tr	4	After a few minutes , he returned , speaking into her ear .
tr	1	" As long as she does not hold us up , " he whispered .
tr	2	" Not so fast , Roberto , " a stern voice said from behind them .
tr	4	Reaching toward her , he lifted the torch to her face and smirked .
tr	0	Her heart was racing as she slapped his hand away , lifting her sword .
tr	2	Blood streamed from the Falcon 's wounds , down his leg , into the sand .
tr	0	A stream of blood ran down his face and the Falcon came for him .
tr	1	His ring cut through the skin and a trickle of blood dripped from his face .
tr	4	His eyes spat angry blue flames , shoving her toward the lights in the distance .
tr	0	" What are you waiting for , Falcon , here I am ! "
tr	3	At that moment she knew how her father looked at that age .
tr	4	Her heart beat increased , trying to make sense of the new development .
tr	3	" You better stop that , " she seethed , struggling to reach for him .
tr	2	" You don 't look so bad yourself , " she said .
tr	1	" No , thanks , I think if I sit down I will fall asleep .
tr	1	Sniffing at the contents , he found it drinkable and handed it to her .
tr	2	That is why I left you on the ship so long , for your protection .
tr	2	" Your father passed away six months ago , and your mother four months ago .
tr	0	He would miss their wisdom , their love for the land that he had shared .
tr	4	When he turned back , his emotions were under control and he spoke .
tr	2	" Your farm is waiting for you ; for you and your wife .
tr	4	There will be , of course , a bonus included in your pay .
tr	4	21 Pierre was made the new Captain of the Contra O Vento .
tr	4	He told her all about the land near Lyon and the life they led there .
tr	4	Then and there and she knew , returning with a positive answer .
tr	0	He had to convince her father that he was the right man for her .
tr	0	He was ticklish and he grinned , grabbing her hand to stop her .
tr	0	" He is brave and caring and not a hard , careless man .
tr	0	" Manuel , wait , let 's hear what is going on . "
tr	4	Her father looked down at her , his face grim and he touched her shoulder .
tr	0	Without any thought , she pulled him into an embrace and kissed both his cheeks .
tr	2	Slowly Cisco came around , the wary look turning into one of interest .
tr	1	With her at my side , my future is filled with promise . "
tr	3	I vow to look after her and treat her with the utmost love and devotion .
tr	2	" You are a good man , Señor , " Roberto said .
tr	2	I will have the physician here tomorrow to look at both ladies .
tr	3	" But , Rafe , " continued the giant carefully , " this is folly .
tr	2	" Come , Finan ; now who 's being the fool ? "
tr	4	The years had bought experience and a widening out of his character .
tr	1	Rafe leaning back in his chair fixed Finan with a mischievous smile .
tr	1	" Pardon my ignorance , but I still do not understand . "
tr	4	Finan watched Rafe finger the edge of the parchment before him again and waited .
tr	4	You 'll agree that she has been persecuted enough for her family ties ? "
tr	3	" And why is it that I may not be that man ? "
tr	1	You need have no fear of stumbling upon any impassioned phrases of undying love ! "
tr	4	" Yet again perfectly correct , Finan , " nodded Rafe with a sigh .
tr	1	" If that is your wish , my lord , " bowed Finan .
tr	2	Finan allowed his master 's words to linger on the air for some moments .
tr	2	" And if I am to be you , who are you to be ? "
tr	0	Finan watched Lord Rafe 's face carefully as he shifted in his chair .
tr	2	" No , although it is advisable to learn from the wisdom of others .
tr	4	I see no need to join myself to their ranks , " answered Finan comfortably .
tr	0	Despite all that , I know that at heart you are a bachelor . "
tr	0	If asked he would have said it was a mark of respect .
tr	4	" I 'm always free to see my most troublesome son ! "
tr	3	" That would explain why ' tis only you that gives me trouble then . "
tr	4	Lord Brogan regarded his son closely for several moments before heaving a large sigh .
tr	4	------- The village was big , much bigger than he had expected .
tr	3	" I am afraid , sir , that you cannot visit the fort . "
tr	0	It was a circumstance that made for a very inauspicious start to an inevitable relationship .
tr	1	" Kindly state your business or be gone , young man . "
tr	0	The fort was , as he already knew , a relic from the roman invasion .
tr	4	The woman opened another large oak door and Rafe entered into a hall .
tr	4	" Although I dare say her needle work is above reproach ! "
tr	3	It is too late for Lady Adele to be travelling tonight . "
tr	2	Only a fool would think it romantic to marry a complete stranger .
tr	3	He had sent his most trusted man to escort you to his home .
tr	3	" But ... it is yet some months to the day of the wedding . "
tr	2	" You must sleep now , for you have along day before you . "
tr	4	At first she had imaged the gifts to have been sent by his father .
tr	2	And so it occurred that Lady Adele was disposed to think well of Lord Rafe .
tr	0	Long ago Adele had decided that Lord Rafe must be a rather shy man .
tr	4	" Come girls , ' tis time to make your farewells . "
tr	0	------ Lady Adele and Lady Eda wasted a great deal of time in saying goodbye .
tr	2	Of all this , of course , Lord Rafe was in ignorance .
tr	4	He hadn 't expected to feel bad about it , so ... deceitful .
tr	1	Now she was studiously avoiding so much as glancing in his direction .
tr	3	Rafe bit back an impatient curse ; did she have to ask that just then ?
tr	2	Only he knew how damaging that answer could prove to be for them both .
tr	3	" Just think , Eda , what an adventure it will be ! "
tr	4	Her large eyes were also glistening , though she resolutely blinked the tears away .
tr	3	" We agreed , did we not , that I would be stiff tonight ? "
tr	2	Understanding flooded through his mind , and he crouched down beside her .
tr	3	" ' tis a strange thing a battle , most especially your first .
tr	1	' Tis an uncivilised emotion that grips you ; a kind of thrill . "
tr	2	Too soon it becomes obvious that there is nothing romantic in the sorry sight .
tr	2	A horror of youth lost and destroyed , an innocence that would never return .
tr	1	She felt sudden compassion for him , a wish to comfort that surprised her .
tr	0	Or he could drag Adele and Eda awake and make a run for the horses .
tr	1	Her voice was low and drowsy , lifting slightly at the end in inquiry .
tr	0	He sighed knowing that he had no choice but to tell her .
tr	4	A tear slipped from beneath her tightly shut lids and she bit her lip .
tr	4	" Eda , please just listen ; we have to run . "
tr	3	Rafe did not turn to see if the two girls had obeyed his instructions .
tr	0	It made his plan to make a stand whilst Adele and Eda escaped untenable .
tr	1	Eda sank , a quivering mass of sobs , to the ground .
tr	4	He moved away from her and instinctively she reached out to stop him .
tr	4	Adele rocked her back and forth slightly , and Eda 's weeping lessened a little .
tr	2	" Do you know how close you came to finding your mark ? "
tr	4	Rafe made a curt gesture for silence and drew her toward the horse .
tr	4	Eda sniffed and allowed him to lift her on to the horse .
tr	0	He hunched his shoulders in the frosty air , rubbing his hands together .
tr	3	" Come , stop this , ' tis of little help . "
tr	3	Let us not think , or talk , of it anymore . "
tr	4	Eda sniffed and wiped the back of her hand over her cheeks .
tr	2	" I do not think so ; ' tis far too cold . "
tr	4	She didn 't believe he was angry , there was no stiffness about him .
tr	4	However , she was a female in his sole protection and undertaking an arduous journey .
tr	2	You looked vastly amusing hanging upside down with your skirts covering your face !
tr	1	" King Ine is unaware of it , my lord , " answered Finan .
tr	3	That fact had not stopped them from pursuing a hostile course toward each other .
tr	1	" So many men lost to both sides , such needless bloodshed . "
tr	1	He could neither understand nor comprehend that a man could kill innocent women and children .
tr	1	There was no answer and thinking of such things only made him agitated and uncomfortable .
tr	2	There were only two courses open to anyone ; the roads of good and evil .
tr	4	No matter what anyone else said , there was no opaque grey area .
tr	1	No word of complaint had passed her lips , yet still he was uneasy .
tr	1	She was still smiling , there was no reproach in her words .
tr	2	" Forgive me , I have not been very good company for you . "
tr	1	" ' Tis an impossible task and who is here to see anyway . "
tr	1	" You will notice , Finn , that we are no one . "
tr	1	Rafe found himself grinning , and held out a hand toward her .
tr	3	Still , this rather grim statement would have brought her merriment to an abrupt end .
tr	3	" To tell the truth I had forgotten all about you , " answered Rafe .
tr	4	" I guessed that to be the case , " replied Eda coolly .
tr	4	Why couldn 't she see that he did not appreciate her questioning his actions .
tr	4	" Oh yes , I could not perfectly recall the name . "
tr	0	The track that Lord Rand had chosen to take was of a much shallower gradient .
tr	0	" Yes , I know ; you have already said that . "
tr	0	" I am so glad we have managed to come to an understanding . "
tr	2	It took several seconds for the full meaning of his words to sink in .
tr	1	" Great goodness , " sighed Finan , weary irritation creeping into his voice .
tr	1	Finan lowered himself into his chair , sinking his head into his hands .
tr	2	" You do not think he is perhaps a little mad do you ?
tr	3	" That is , I did as you told me to , Master Finan . "
tr	1	Finan was silent for some time , a serious frown on his face .
tr	4	" Yes , well ; as we have seen he has deplorable taste . "
tr	3	" I lack sufficient ambition to please my father , not that it matters .
tr	4	Her drowsy eyes looked into his and in their depths he could see genuine admiration .
tr	1	" Can you not see that he is doing his best for us ? "
tr	0	He leaned across , taking her hand that was furthest from him in his own .
tr	2	He looked out into the rain , wondering if any of them would sleep tonight .
tr	2	" So I do not precisely understand how you know this ' Randolph ' . "
tr	0	No doubt they had played with the very toys that he himself had provided !
tr	0	" But he was due to visit us again a few days from now . "
tr	2	It was nice to have his visits to look forward to . "
tr	3	The words almost choked him to say , but still he forced them out .
tr	0	" I find that maxim has always kept me from disappointment . "
tr	1	Rafe fought within himself to find a suitable answer for this question .
tr	4	Rafe had a sudden suspicion that they were no longer talking of the same thing .
tr	3	The one that is more than just the thought that someone followed us . "
tr	3	" Nor is that an end to the matter , for they follow us still .
tr	3	If they do wish to attack us , why do they not make their move ?
tr	4	Absolute silence greeted this statement , and Rafe began to feel rather ill used .
tr	2	And you looked so horrified when you thought you would have to explain . "
tr	3	" It would be for the best , would it not , Finn ? "
tr	2	Such ministrations seemed to Rafe to call for some comment on his part .
tr	2	Of course , he would have to do something about the warrior first .
tr	2	Soon the time would come , his wait would not be long .
tr	4	The wind picked up and sent a sighing breath of dampness through the trees .
tr	1	However , as Lord Rand had stated , the warrior was no longer there .
tr	3	" No , no ; ' tis just a trick of the light . "
tr	1	" No , leave it , just in case it was a guess .
tr	3	The two of them retreated , silently making their way back to their camp .
tr	1	" Forgive me , Finan ; t ' was unthinking of me to wake you .
tr	2	" I never thought to see you so poor spirited , Brogan .
tr	2	When I think of how it was with you when we were boys .
tr	3	" It matters not , I have the time to wait . "
tr	4	" But of course I did ; Rafe told me weeks since . "
tr	4	Lord Brogan 's deep chuckle rumbled softly across the space between them .
tr	2	" I am so stiff , I could not even tell you . "
tr	1	When Rafe returned it was to find Adele frowning and Eda wincing .
tr	4	" We shall have time to eat before we go then ? "
tr	3	He could tell them , but what would be the gain of such an action ?
tr	3	Are you not even a little put out by this news ? "
tr	4	The silence that greeted this question was broken by Adele standing abruptly .
tr	3	Her voice was tight and shaking with the effort to remain controlled .
tr	0	His mouth opened that he might explain , but he had no words .
tr	3	Rafe stared down into her face , knowing what he should do but still hesitating .
tr	1	Her grip was surprisingly strong causing him to spin round to face her .
tr	4	" I have apologised for the whole and begged Lady Adele 's pardon .
tr	3	" In the answer to that question I am greatly interested . "
tr	2	And be thankful that you still have the use of all your limbs ! "
tr	1	Anyone might think you had been up all night , Finan ! "
tr	4	They all sat quietly for innumerable seconds as the sound moved closer to them .
tr	4	Rafe drew his sword and turned to meet the hunting party as they approached .
tr	0	All halted as they came across Rafe standing alone and with sword drawn before him .
tr	0	His hair was dark and a beard covered the lower half of his face .
tr	2	" You have to say that to convince me to spare you ! "
tr	2	" Did you really think that I would not know also ? "
tr	2	Sword I will allow you , for I like to see some sport !
tr	2	" You saw not how he fought today , Brother , " he replied softly .
tr	4	If he sent out riders after them would they have a sufficient head start ?
tr	3	That does not mean that I wish to see you fail in this endeavour . "
tr	1	" Your family will hardly be satisfied should I triumph , " replied Rafe .
tr	4	" Very well : for some reason they were in danger from the hunt .
tr	4	" From here they must have lifted him onto a horse . "
tr	1	Bron caught the bridle of Lord Rand 's horse and led it to his master .
tr	3	" I have yet to meet the man I could not track . "
tr	3	" You had better take two of the men and follow his tracks .
tr	4	The warrior 's movements will be unexpected , they always are . "
tr	2	Come to that he would not mind the chance of finding one of those himself .
tr	3	No , she wasn 't sure that that was something she wanted to think about .
tr	0	" Finn said that we would be able to find our way . "
tr	1	Mercia 's border is close , what if we should cross it by accident ? "
tr	3	It seem that to lie down and rest just for a moment could not hurt .
tr	0	She had enough faith in him to know that he was correct .
tr	3	" It is best that we do just as Finn told us . "
tr	3	They would have died that first night if it hadn 't been for Finn .
tr	0	In any case the fact remained that Finn had saved her and Eda 's lives .
tr	4	Eda was tired , confused , and slightly worried by Adele 's behaviour .
tr	4	" And the sooner we can help Finn , " Eda finished quietly .
tr	1	It was early , a cold damp day of drizzle falling from invisible skies .
tr	3	" ' Tis only the mist , it ... unsettles me . "
tr	0	Rafe had found his sword and turned to grapple with another phantom like shadow .
tr	1	Finan lifted his hand , demanding silence , and stared out into the milky whiteness .
tr	4	His friend had paled dramatically , and he flexed restless fingers against the hilt .
tr	4	For the first time the other lady spoke , her voice impatient .
tr	2	" You did splendidly ; enjoy your rest , good boy . "
tr	2	" Yes , my lady , rest assured that all will be well . "
tr	0	The assurance was perfunctory and with a swift bow he was gone .
tr	2	" Might I fetch a goblet of wine for you , my lady ? "
tr	3	" I thought that he was not so tall as Finn . "
tr	2	" I do not know ; I thought I heard something . "
tr	1	As Finan spoke he was pulling his sword free of its sheath .
tr	1	It was Finan 's voice breaking the silence , its timbre challenging .
tr	1	His action was designed to provoke , and Rafe 's hands clenched into fists .
tr	0	As it was he had the satisfaction of seeing Adele slap Rand 's hand away .
tr	4	Such an intensity of feeling as was between them was impossible between strangers .
tr	1	" I promise I will not lay a hand on him . "
tr	3	Rafe paused trying to swallow the bitterness that threatened to choke him .
tr	0	" I do not care what you want , Rand , " panted Rafe .
tr	1	Rand wrenched himself from Finan 's hold and sat back down in his seat .
tr	0	It was that which had puzzled him , and Rand 's explanation made everything clear .
tr	3	Rafe knew it was true but somehow could not bring himself to admit it .
tr	2	As I recall it was not so important to you once . "
tr	2	" And of course , not forgetting , ' Lord Rafe ' . "
tr	4	" Finan surely you would not have left me so entirely ? "
tr	0	Rafe had again closed his eyes and leant his head back against the chair .
tr	4	If he could forgive , would he ever be able to forget ?
tr	2	" However only you know if it fits his actions in following you . "
tr	3	" The truth is it fits too well for him to be lying . "
tr	2	He looked up to find two pairs of anxious eyes upon him .
tr	3	I think then , that it would be best if I say nothing . "
tr	4	Rafe looked relieved for a moment before a frown settled on his brow .
tr	0	" Maybe ... Lady Eda was asking what she thought of Lord Rafe . "
tr	3	" I managed to hear the rest right , did I not ? "
tr	3	The little boy was intent upon his task and did not look up .
tr	1	" Such an endeavour as this requires careful handling , " King Ine murmured thoughtfully .
tr	1	" I believe he will excel in finding an answer to this situation . "
tr	2	" You wish to see to this affair yourself , you mean ? "
tr	1	This thing seems to have hit you harder than I imagined it would . "
tr	4	She was promised to Lord Rafe , how could she have let this happen ?
tr	1	Surely this was as cruel a twist for him as it was for her ?
tr	4	Adele bit her lip , feeling a sudden rush of pity for her betrothed .
tr	2	Until now the course he has chosen to pursue has done more good than harm .
tr	3	Now that the reverse is true , he will set things straight . "
tr	0	" Rafe has a temper and loses it as often as not .
tr	2	Finan did not look satisfied , and opened his mouth to argue the point .
tr	2	" Would you like me to accompany you , Lord Rafe ? "
tr	2	A few moments in their company and you would have them at sword point .
tr	2	You only care to use that smooth tongue of yours in the company of women .
tr	1	" My master asked that you might come quickly , my lord . "
tr	4	" ' Tis only that we must make haste , " he replied .
tr	3	" What is so wrong that your master sent for me with such urgency ? "
tr	4	The soldier 's eyes flickered to Finan for a moment , filled with hesitant worry .
tr	2	" Not by you , Lord Rafe , nor by anyone else . "
tr	3	The blade flew swiftly through the air , but the distance was far .
tr	3	He knew the most important thing was that he kept his seat .
tr	4	Every movement Brute made jolted him making him feel sick and dizzy .
tr	0	Rand held him tightly , choking a little over his words as he spoke them .
tr	0	Rand called for the page , and gave Bron his full attention .
tr	1	Bron nodded and ran into the mist , his figure disappearing almost instantly .
tr	2	Rand looked down and saw the reason for the boy 's revulsion .
tr	0	Seeing that the camp was small they advanced at a gallop , spears levelled .
tr	2	Rand stood his ground , his feet firmly planted as one soldier advanced towards him .
tr	0	" Because Rafe took it into his head that Lady Adele was still in danger .
tr	3	" I suppose that means I am to expect a visit from him then ? "
tr	1	Finan is unconscious and a little feverish , he sleeps still . "
tr	4	" Come then , he is resting at Rand 's camp . "
tr	1	" Why is it always inactivity and patience that is required ? "
tr	4	" He will feel better once he has made this plain to her . "
tr	2	" I hope you know what you are doing , Finn . "
tr	4	Adele surreptitiously regarded Rafe from beneath her lashes and found he looked preoccupied and distant .
tr	4	Then he saw her gaze turn self conscious and embarrassment flooded her face with colour .
tr	0	By and by she began to notice that all was not well after all .
tr	0	He wished she would speak , say something that would tell him her thoughts .
tr	2	Somehow it made it worse , but she would not cry in front of him .
tr	3	Why must it be that he lost that ability when talking to Adele ?
tr	3	He hadn 't the slightest idea what he ought to do to make things better .
tr	0	" He was ambushed by someone who thought that he was Lord Rafe .
tr	0	Rafe was watching her carefully , as if looking for some reaction .
tr	0	" Adele , I ... " Rafe paused trying to marshal his thoughts .
tr	0	" Adele , I am sorry for any pain I have caused you . "
tr	4	" Well he is in a black temper , is he not ? "
tr	4	They had been so young , she and Adele ; so sheltered and innocent .
tr	0	How many times had she thought that there had been something in his eyes ?
tr	4	Rafe did not turn from his task but became even more intently focused upon it .
tr	4	Some time elapsed before Rafe spoke again , his voice filled with determined bravado .
tr	4	" Fear is not an emotion to be disparaged , it breeds a dangerous power .
tr	4	He has nothing more to lose and his actions will be desperate . "
tr	2	" Forgive me ; to which of your problems do you refer ? "
tr	3	" I never thought of that , " his tone was startled .
tr	2	" I do not know if they will be of any use . "
tr	4	" You do not seem to hold either lady in very high esteem . "
tr	1	" Having seen her I should say she will not disappoint in that duty . "
tr	4	You will remember that I offered her my hand and heart before you did .
tr	2	" Besides ' tis no more than you would do to me . "
tr	2	It had become obvious that he had looked forward to his marriage with trepidation .
tr	0	All in all he thought that Rafe might brush through the thing very well .
tr	0	" I actually meant is she still agreeable to marrying you ? "
tr	0	That which she saw in his face brought the ache of tears to her throat .
tr	4	Adele 's eyes travelled to the man lying on the makeshift bed .
tr	0	The last time she had seen him she had thought him to be her betrothed .
tr	2	" Now you have to prepare him for bathing , Drogo . "
tr	1	Adele nodded , already trying to bring some coolness back to Finan 's skin .
tr	2	Adele nodded briefly , and Eda stood and moved back to the fire .
tr	4	Rafe dragged the seat to the tent opening where there was a slight breeze .
tr	3	" Let us not pretend that you know not what I mean . "
tr	3	Still , it didn 't change the fact that he had done no wrong .
tr	4	Then again , perhaps a clean break would have been better after all .
tr	4	Perhaps it would have been easier for her if it had just ended .
tr	1	Adele was watching his face closely for some sign as to his thoughts .
tr	3	" It matters not to me if you call me by it sometimes .
tr	3	Rafe winced ; that hadn 't come out as he had meant it to .
tr	3	More than anything he wanted to say something , to explain to her his thoughts .
tr	0	" Do you think , Adele , that you could be happy again ? "
tr	4	If she and Rand loved one another , could he deny her freedom ?
tr	2	" I thought t ' would be some foolishness of that sort .
tr	2	You find yourself in trouble and expect me to help you out of it .
tr	0	He looked scared , almost hunted , and had the air of a petulant child .
tr	0	He said he was ; why should I have doubted him ? "
tr	3	" That there is more to this than either of us know . "
tr	4	Finan 's lips moved as he repeated this assurance over to himself silently .
tr	2	" Have you no sense knocking around that thick head of yours ? "
tr	0	You know that to lay a hand on Adele is to challenge me .
tr	1	He drained the goblet swiftly , finding it to be surprisingly good .
tr	0	" Fear not , Finan , I shall not drag you before an altar .
tr	4	" She knows a man is not returned to childhood just because he feels unwell .
tr	0	Rafe was already at the tent opening , watching Adele as she walked away .
tr	0	Perhaps Eda was right and this was just as hard for him .
tr	3	Rafe thought not but felt very grateful to her for making it easier on him .
tr	4	As a young man he had been the best warrior in the kingdom .
tr	4	A boy no better than a king 's jester , prone to levity and laziness .
tr	3	There is nothing like the wisdom that age brings to sort these things out . "
tr	0	" Any man that can hold his own against Stefan has my admiration . "
tr	4	Its warmth was gentle and forgiving , healing the breach between them .
tr	2	" What do you mean ; who do you try and warn me of ? "
tr	3	" Whatever it is , I do not know what it could be . "
tr	1	It was his curse , the price of his father 's actions .
tr	2	I am truly honoured to receive so much help from your family .
tr	4	Adele turned the full power of her gaze upon both men and each bowed deeply .
tr	4	She did not return the pressure but her hand remained limp in his .
tr	0	There was a slight pause , and then Rand gave an abrupt nod .
tr	4	His voice and face were blank , concealing his feelings from her probing eyes .
tr	0	Rand held her away from him so that his eyes might search her face .
tr	4	He hated uncertainty , and Adele inspired uncertainty in almost all of their dealings .
tr	4	However , he found his determination had once again under gone a perceptible change .
tr	0	Adele glanced up at his face and surprised a faraway look in his eyes .
tr	2	" Perhaps you would care to sit down , my lord ? "
tr	4	" Adele , yesterday ... " " You need not explain , my lord . "
tr	1	" If it is your wish , that purpose is achieved . "
tr	1	" It is obvious that you hold him in much affection . "
tr	4	Rafe continued to stare at her for some time after she had made this declaration .
tr	4	He paused , waiting to see if she would accept the gesture .
tr	1	Adele knelt at Finan 's side , smearing ointment on his wound .
tr	4	His words did not seem to have any heartening effect on his foster brother .
tr	1	Rafe bit his lip as Finan 's face showed plainly his chagrin .
tr	1	Rafe stirred in his chair ; all of the inactivity was frustrating him .
tr	2	He opened his mouth to speak , but words were not forthcoming .
tr	3	Rafe fingered the sword at his side but did not pull it from its sheath .
tr	3	Rafe moved his hand so that it rested against the hilt of his sword .
tr	4	" What did I ever do to you that I should deserve such hate ? "
tr	1	Rafe was startled by such injustice and angry words sprang to his lips .
tr	4	" Always so ready to believe in honour , pride , and unselfishness .
tr	0	With a groan the man staggered back and fell to the floor .
tr	3	Yet there was still men pouring through the open door that led into the courtyard .
tr	4	" However , for the rest you must answer to King Ine . "
tr	4	Rafe turned to the youth , surprise and respect filling his eyes .
tr	4	Eda jumped as she heard Rand 's voice , low and close to her ear .
tr	3	" It ... it was not my intention to try and attach your feelings . "
tr	0	she spat , bringing her hand up and landing a forceful slap across his cheek .
tr	0	Eda could do naught but obey him and gaze with longing at the camp .
tr	3	but the ... I want to go back to the camp now . "
tr	2	" Do you think that you could do more than just like me ? "
tr	3	" That is too much ... I cannot tell you that . "
tr	0	It was as though all hope had gone , leaving him suddenly bleak .
tr	0	" And anyone who is associated with us must bear that shame also . "
tr	2	Only a fool would put himself in the position of being rejected . "
tr	0	It soon became apparent that he had said all he was going to say .
tr	3	" Rand ... " She hesitated , struggling to find the right words .
tr	4	Please ... " Rand looked down at the soft creature nestled within his arms .
tr	3	" Do you intend to settle all of our arguments that way ? "
tr	3	" You can ask that , when you irritate me thus ? "
tr	2	" You are wondering what has happened to your son no doubt ? "
tr	0	Lord Brogan smiled appreciatively ; Rafe was indeed a fortunate young man .
tr	4	With a deft movement he had removed the sword from the older man 's hand .
tr	3	He sought to deflect attention from the fact that he was actually collecting Lady Adele .
tr	1	He paused , feeling that his omission of certain facts was only wise .
tr	0	" Have I not always said that he were a devious knave ? "
tr	3	He did not think that this was the best time to argue the point .
tr	4	Relief entered Rand 's eyes and he took Lord Brogan 's outstretched hand eagerly .
tr	3	" Is there anything you want to tell me , Rand ? "
tr	4	For a moment Rand stared at her in confusion and then his eyes cleared .
tr	0	" However I had always known that one day I would leave .
tr	3	" Rafe protected us from the worst ; it was actually rather fun . "
tr	0	" Rafe has always been adept at living out of doors . "
tr	2	Lord Brogan thought he could hear a tinge of bashful confusion in her voice .
tr	4	" You know ; I remember the first time I saw you . "
tr	0	" I managed to make Rafe rest , " continued Lord Brogan sadly .
tr	0	Rafe shook his head and , held out a hand toward Adele .
tr	2	More than anything the role of king is of mediator , not of dictator .
tr	1	Lord Brogan sat back in his chair , his eyes firmly fixed on his son .
tr	0	That is why your suit was accepted above all others , Rafe . "
tr	4	Adele had voiced a wish to retire and he had immediately risen to escort her .
tr	4	In the darkness she could not see the grin she heard in his voice .
tr	1	" The saying of such things is only easy if one has had much practise .
tr	3	It pleases me to know that you have not spoken such things often . "
tr	1	Super fun beginning , great story , and an ending that won 't disappoint .
tr	1	This is a work of fiction , and is produced from the author 's imagination .
tr	1	People , places and things mentioned in this novel are used in a fictional manner .
tr	3	I tripped for the third time , straining to hear the lap of the water .
tr	0	Malcolm lifted his hands , palms out , in an act of surrender .
tr	1	Malcolm sipped his sparkling cider , which I promptly whipped away from him .
tr	1	Once I 'd admitted it , I couldn 't look him in the face .
tr	3	I sipped the sparkling cider , letting the tart liquid coat my throat .
tr	4	" The court has decided to let you off with an easy sentence . "
tr	0	His face turned a bit pale as he realized I meant what I said .
tr	3	Two All I did was tie his wrists together and take off his clothes .
tr	1	The sounds of Paris rushed around me , swirling into a crescendo .
tr	1	He 'd smiled and invited me into his world , his life .
tr	0	Blood gushed down his arm , leaving a trail and dripping onto the grass .
tr	1	But I had no idea if it was working , especially in the growing darkness .
tr	2	The smell of blood and the protruding flap of skin sent my stomach into upheaval .
tr	3	I called out to tourists and couples walking past , but they ignored me .
tr	1	Or , " I tied him up but I didn 't shoot him ! "
tr	2	" Oh , now you want me to be okay , " Malcolm mumbled .
tr	3	I felt past the quilt to the cloth napkin tied around his wrists .
tr	3	He glanced to the right and left as if hoping to spot the shooter .
tr	0	I didn 't look back , but flew across the grass toward the main road .
tr	4	What if the gunman had bad aim or sneezed as he pulled the trigger ?
tr	3	I reached out to grab the stem , trying to miss the thorns .
tr	4	I let my head fall against my knees and tried to ignore the guilt .
tr	1	With each painful minute , I pictured Malcolm , running , falling , getting shot .
tr	4	I rubbed my shoulders , ignoring the fear squeezing the breath out of my chest .
tr	2	Clouds passed over the moon , casting a shadow over the city of lights .
tr	1	The one full of different spy gadgets -- gifts from Dad , of course .
tr	2	I was hoping to find a bulletproof vest or weapon of some sort .
tr	3	My mouth went dry and I struggled to find the right words .
tr	3	I didn 't want to see his reaction to me getting shot at .
tr	1	I cared if I 'd accidentally had a hand in killing him .
tr	3	Right next to the stories about some big pastry extravaganza contest and a dog show .
tr	2	The paper says the police found evidence of a shooting and lots of blood .
tr	4	I left a guy half-naked by the Eiffel Tower last night , alone and bleeding .
tr	4	My words came out kind of breathless , like I 'd run ten miles .
tr	0	Something about Malcolm being alive and at work , and me never eating cookies again .
tr	3	A little out of breath , Aimee said , " Start talking . "
tr	0	What if he was lying in a foreign hospital or tied up as a hostage ?
tr	0	And I had no idea why or what he was mixed up in .
tr	3	The whole ride on the Metro , I tried not to think about Malcolm .
tr	0	Overall , it was kind of creepy -- exactly what Dad wanted .
tr	2	He settled into the back of the crowd , cool and composed .
tr	0	I leaned slightly forward to catch a look at his guilty face .
tr	1	I felt a spinning sensation before I realized I was falling forward .
tr	1	I 'd look like a loser , but I didn 't care .
tr	2	Blood rushed to my face , mostly because I was tilting forward .
tr	2	But I just ended up flopping around like a fish on a hook .
tr	0	A part of me wanted to , and I swear I heard a snicker .
tr	0	I walked past the macho man and noted his name : Cliff Peyton .
tr	4	These quiet moments alone were the hardest because inevitably they gave me time to think .
tr	4	The art student nodded toward the amateur spies as one of them crossed the room .
tr	0	He pushed his hair away from his face and revealed his familiar face .
tr	1	I just love painting and being an art student so much . "
tr	0	All my arm waving and mixtures of Italian and French had been pointless .
tr	0	As soon as they turned to leave , Malcolm jabbed his paintbrush at me .
tr	3	" At least I didn 't take your clothes off and tie you up . "
tr	2	" Though you do have an odd way of showing it . "
tr	4	" Aren 't you the least bit interested in what happened ? "
tr	0	I grabbed my bag from the floor and used it as a shield .
tr	0	Malcolm put his hands on the bag and tried to keep me from backing away .
tr	4	One more spy team was set to come through , and I was screwed .
tr	3	Weaving in and out of the tourists , I raced to the first floor .
tr	4	Crisp air filled my lungs as I entwined my fingers through the mesh cage .
tr	1	I 'd always imagined Mom visiting and walking with me through the Louvre .
tr	0	Her blonde hair fell right below her chin and swished back and forth .
tr	2	" Do you know where I could buy some root beer ? "
tr	1	I stared , mouth agape , as French flowed from her mouth in angry currents .
tr	0	What had happened to my business-like mom who wasn 't scared of anything ?
tr	2	I didn 't know the mom who wore disguises and told me to burn packages .
tr	4	But after years of being so busy with work , she needed my help .
tr	0	After leaving Dad and me two years ago , did I want to help ?
tr	2	Not only did you fail there but you did here too . "
tr	0	With one last grunt and glare at Aimee , he strode away .
tr	3	I waited while the few tourists we 'd attracted got bored with staring .
tr	3	Still , I wasn 't sure I was ready to accept it with no explanations .
tr	3	" Little late to start playing the game , don 't you think ? "
tr	1	" Thanks to you and your friend I won 't even finish .
tr	2	" How are you going to make up for your big mistake ? "
tr	3	Is this what it took for Dad to act like he cared ?
tr	4	Blood rushed to my face , and the room felt about a hundred degrees hotter .
tr	0	I grabbed my backpack , hiding the tears , and ran from the room .
tr	1	Peyton 's angry face flashed in my mind and my legs shook .
tr	2	No one was allowed to touch her mail or go through her things .
tr	3	But more importantly I found a note , typed , with no signature .
tr	4	I started pulling them out , more and more , until green covered the table .
tr	0	Dad chuckled and talked , and I heard Frankie and Nancy and Gray .
tr	4	I shoved everything into the back of my closet and waited to make my entrance .
tr	3	Frankie 's legs twitched like he wanted to bolt and avoid the confrontation .
tr	2	I ducked my head in epic shame , biding my time as Dad closed .
tr	2	" Did you or did you not bring candy into the Louvre ? "
tr	1	And no one would 've known if it hadn 't been for Malcolm . "
tr	2	" Malcolm asked to observe Spy Games before officially applying for a job .
tr	3	Part of what drew customers was incorporating big tourist spots like the Louvre .
tr	2	I always apologized , hoping to smooth over the tension in the house .
tr	0	I shriveled up and wanted to crawl away and hide in a sandbank .
tr	4	He motioned for me to sit down , but the stubborn side of me refused .
tr	1	I read over it again , but I didn 't believe it .
tr	1	Peyton 's words pounded in my brain and spread into my heart like poison .
tr	0	I 'd failed Dad today but this was my chance to make up for everything .
tr	2	We could work together on a mission , and he 'd be so happy .
tr	0	" Dad , I have a strong feeling she did not go backpacking .
tr	2	" I 'm going back to the office to work on the new route . "
tr	0	A year ago I would 've agreed with Dad and squashed any doubts .
tr	0	Monday morning came , and I woke with a major Spy Games hangover .
tr	3	The blurry reflection in the toaster of a dark shape caught my attention .
tr	0	" If you have a flash , I can download any documents . "
tr	3	I was determined not to show that his surprise visit had me rattled .
tr	4	Thoughts of Aimee were constantly with me , hovering in the back of my mind .
tr	3	Who was he to waltz into my kitchen at this time in the morning ?
tr	1	I waved the knife in the air to show I meant what I said .
tr	4	One of his employees left suddenly and he needed a quick replacement .
tr	0	Malcolm was leaning against a lamppost with his legs crossed , so casual and relaxed .
tr	3	" I meant talk about whatever it is you 're worried about . "
tr	3	" Yeah , um , sorry about the other night and you almost getting killed .
tr	0	He tipped his head back for the last drops from his cup .
tr	1	" I 'm trying to figure out how this is training , " Malcolm complained .
tr	1	" I keep asking Aimee when you are going to visit again . "
tr	1	As soon as she left , I kicked Malcolm in the shins .
tr	3	I distracted myself with a tiny thread unraveling from the cloth napkin .
tr	2	The more I got to know Malcolm , the more I liked him .
tr	2	" To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit ? "
tr	0	Malcolm leaned back with a cookie , an amused look on his face .
tr	1	How exactly do I tell a grandmother that her only living relative is missing ?
tr	4	Malcolm kicked me under the table as if to say " good one . "
tr	2	Do you think I could take a look in her room ? "
tr	2	In the doorway , I looked over the room before poking around .
tr	2	I promptly moved into the room , desperate to find proof she was on vacation .
tr	2	I threw open the doors to her closet to find half of her clothes gone .
tr	3	The reality that my best friend was most likely kidnapped hit me in the gut .
tr	4	Fourteen The next morning , I whipped off the covers as soon as Dad left .
tr	1	" Are you trying to get arrested for robbing a bank ? "
tr	1	I scowled at him and pulled a paper clip from my pocket .
tr	2	Dad stopped talking for a second and I didn 't dare say anything else .
tr	1	I 'd put myself in a dangerous position , but it was all for Aimee .
tr	1	" The business has only been running for a few months . "
tr	3	" I doubt it , but at some point she probably was . "
tr	0	" Are we going to scale the wall and break in through a window ? "
tr	3	I took the stairs to the third floor , with Malcolm at my heels .
tr	1	Malcolm pursed his lips to the side and took a step back .
tr	2	Malcolm stood in the doorway , a coil of rope dangling from his hands .
tr	1	" You think I had something to do with your friend 's disappearance ? "
tr	0	" I came to check out your place for any clues . "
tr	2	I didn 't stay for coffee , and ran out the door .
tr	2	We booked it out the front door , Peyton 's words ringing in my ears .
tr	1	I turned down one street and then the other with no direction in my mind .
tr	0	We 'd sampled about every croissant , tart , and scone in Paris .
tr	1	I kept walking , leaving him with the sting of my words .
tr	0	With both hands on his chest , I pushed him away and broke the spell .
tr	3	" I 'll text you about our next training , " I yelled .
tr	0	Each hour gnawed away at the faith that I 'd find Aimee .
tr	2	How in the world of French pastries would I beat out top chefs ?
tr	3	I didn 't want to talk to him about any of this .
tr	4	He glanced at the table and I could sense the flooding memories .
tr	2	I 'm trying to get this business off the ground and provide for you . "
tr	1	Why did I feel guilty for wanting to spend time with my dad ?
tr	4	I directed my glare of complete evil between the two of them .
tr	0	" Malcolm called earlier and said you 'd missed a couple days of training . "
tr	0	" I have to come up with an entry for the Extravaganza . "
tr	4	Next time we can pass a hundred shops if you want before choosing one . "
tr	4	I drew closer and whispered , " What 's going on ? "
tr	1	" I hope you 're not planning an afternoon of flirting . "
tr	1	I ran my finger across an empty bookshelf hung on the wall .
tr	0	I 'd hoped he had a crystal ball that would reveal how to find Aimee .
tr	0	As I waited for his answer , I allowed myself a brief daydream .
tr	4	The stale smell of an abandoned house would greet me but I 'd push through .
tr	1	I 'd call for Aimee to hear her struggle from a back room .
tr	2	On our way out , I 'd take down a couple bad guys .
tr	3	" Haven 't you been paying attention to the trackers you planted ? "
tr	4	And I 've been up to my eyeballs with Spy Games stuff . "
tr	2	I figured you 'd want to be all business today without your dad knowing . "
tr	3	The flutter in my chest had told me great things would happen today .
tr	2	" You 're not very good at this , are you ? "
tr	1	I swayed with dizziness just looking at it , and I gripped Malcolm 's cane .
tr	4	I followed his gaze , fearing and hoping that he 'd seen someone .
tr	2	" A man just ducked into the woods over on the cliff . "
tr	1	Malcolm was soon with me , gently lifting me up by the arm .
tr	3	Wasn 't that the same kind of rope we found in Peyton 's apartment ? "
tr	4	He 'll be on the move again and we 'll find him . "
tr	3	I didn 't want Malcolm to know how much it was getting to me .
tr	4	He laced our hands and pressed his face into the crook of my neck .
tr	1	My granny shoes clicked against the bridge , until I finally kicked them off .
tr	2	I didn 't want to hear those footsteps coming closer and closer .
tr	1	I was glad I didn 't have to look him in the eyes .
tr	4	What did you do to be prepared in the face of danger ? "
tr	3	And why she didn 't trust me enough to talk to me ?
tr	1	I 'd missed something , some clue , important to finding her .
tr	0	At Marie 's house , right away I knew something was wrong .
tr	2	I wasn 't the kind of girl to jump out of second story windows .
tr	2	Sweat broke out all over my body in a rush of heat .
tr	1	Marie 's front door slammed , and I jumped up to run like crazy .
tr	2	I couldn 't catch one word of her French it was flowing so fast .
tr	4	She slowly faced me and shook her head no , then hurried into her house .
tr	2	I lied to Dad about needing a day of shopping then slipped out .
tr	0	A group of older men with beards and violins played classical music .
tr	3	Frosting of multiple colors decorated the tops with fancy lettering and ribbons .
tr	1	Or if she was , it was just to make sure I finished the job .
tr	2	I turned to open door number two , but voices filled the room .
tr	0	He stood by a pillar with ivy wrapped around it and faced Malcolm .
tr	4	If he found me , he could smother me with decorated cakes .
tr	2	Columns of my smoky breath rose in the air and dissipated in front of me .
tr	0	Their words shot through the air like gunshots pinging back and forth at each other .
tr	1	" Trust me , she 's an innocent in the whole thing . "
tr	2	I was sure it would echo into the other room and possibly down the street .
tr	1	My fingernails dug into the palms of my hands , breaking the skin .
tr	3	In Peyton 's apartment , it was Malcolm who brought me the rope .
tr	1	I wished I could turn off my heart and hide it in layers of ice .
tr	1	I guess someone in the crowd shot him with a tranquilizer gun . "
tr	3	It didn 't work out too well for us the last time . "
tr	4	He brushed his hair out of his eyes and smoothed the edge of the blanket .
tr	4	She got up before the crack of dawn to run like fifteen miles . "
tr	1	" She 'd sprint across the nearby cow pastures and hurdle hay bales .
tr	4	I had to stop inviting them over because she 'd scare them away .
tr	3	I don 't even want to talk about the knife throwing . "
tr	1	He stopped rubbing and slid his hands down the sides of my arms .
tr	1	I lifted my head slightly and brushed my lips against his neck .
tr	1	I planted small kisses on his neck , moving up to his jaw .
tr	1	Tiny sparks of heat spread from the touch of his fingers on my skin .
tr	1	His hands dropped from my arms as if my skin were poison .
tr	4	The only thing she ever exterminated were the dust bunnies under our couch . "
tr	1	I rubbed my arms and blew into my hands to warm my fingers .
tr	1	" I might stop by Malcolm 's to review some Spy Games rules . "
tr	4	I wiggled one of Dad 's fancy devices in the keyhole and the lock popped .
tr	2	I stormed through his bedroom , closets , and kitchen looking for something , anything .
tr	0	After about half an hour , I plunked down at the table .
tr	3	Just as I slid the doors shut , they waltzed into the room .
tr	2	" Would you like a drink to top off the evening ? "
tr	0	" Why don 't we have some fun and play a game ? "
tr	1	" I felt stupid , so I hid in the closet . "
tr	4	Malcolm flashed a wry grin , like he didn 't believe me .
tr	1	I grabbed a plain white dish and held it out like a shield .
tr	2	" What are you doing asking so many questions about my mom ? "
tr	1	The emotion built in my chest until I yelled , " LIAR ! "
tr	0	Please , just go about your way and act like a normal teen . "
tr	3	My body and heart were traitors to what I knew in my mind .
tr	3	That he was a liar and refused to tell me the truth .
tr	3	" Do you still have that damn serving tray up your shirt ? "
tr	1	With a flick of his wrist , he untied the ropes from my arms .
tr	0	Halfway through the doorway , I heard him shout out , " The girl .
tr	3	That sick feeling I 'd gotten my facts wrong sat in my gut .
tr	1	" Did you have anything to do with Aimee being kidnapped ? "
tr	3	White shutters at the windows winked at me in a friendly sort of way .
tr	1	The voice of his companion was familiar , but I couldn 't quite place it .
tr	4	They were debating , words pinging back and forth at each other .
tr	4	Were those the same clothes she wore when I visited her with Malcolm ?
tr	3	Twenty-eight With a quick but strong yank , someone pulled me from my hiding spot .
tr	2	His full , curly beard still held crumbs from his day in the kitchen .
tr	0	But since we 'd arrived in France it was all about Spy Games .
tr	1	" Traditions , meeting with friends and family that is the joi de vive .
tr	2	" Girl , you do not know what you are talking about . "
tr	3	Jolie roared with laughter , great big bouts that dwindled down to chuckles .
tr	0	" You are a washed up pastry chef heading past his prime .
tr	1	Suddenly he was by my side , his fingers digging into my arm .
tr	4	Had Jolie left me to die at the claws of a bunch of chickens ?
tr	0	With a wave of my arms , I tried to shoo the hen away .
tr	3	Let 's talk about you so we don 't talk about me .
tr	3	Thirty minutes later , Malcolm and I stood outside the Notre Dame cathedral .
tr	3	Tourists brushed past us to enter the old church , but I wasn 't ready .
tr	4	I shouldn 't have to use it if I played the game .
tr	3	I stopped in my tracks , right at the bottom of the stairs .
tr	0	That I wasn 't a spy , that I wasn 't a danger to anyone .
tr	3	" I was just thinking how we 've got a lot of stairs to climb .
tr	4	Again , a few seconds later , the footsteps behind us stopped too .
tr	3	I took little comfort in the feel of the metal tray pressed against my chest .
tr	0	Fear chased me , always a step away , ready to grab me .
tr	4	The grimacing demon and other winged gargoyles sent shivers through my body .
tr	1	Confident Jolie wasn 't home , I stepped inside into the lingering smell of cinnamon .
tr	4	Being in Jolie 's home , which felt cozy and happy , pricked my heart .
tr	3	Not wanting to wake up a snoozing pastry chef , I crept through the downstairs .
tr	4	I needed to sweep the whole house and be smart about this .
tr	2	My body froze up , and I couldn 't get my legs to move .
tr	2	Why didn 't I bring rope to escape out the second story window ?
tr	2	I shimmied into the bathroom and whipped back and forth for a spot to hide .
tr	1	If I made it through this , I 'd confess to everything .
tr	4	But this one could be my downfall , and it hovered inches from my face .
tr	2	But many showed the growing up of a girl with blonde curls .
tr	3	But maybe , just maybe , that was how she 'd wanted it .
tr	0	And more importantly , how it was all connected to my family and me .
tr	4	The dull , flickering flashlight cast weird shadows and barely penetrated the darkness .
tr	2	Niches carved into the walls held candles with small flames lighting the way .
tr	2	I trailed my fingers along the small hills and valleys of the wall .
tr	4	Eventually , they 'd return and go back up the ladder to Jolie 's kitchen .
tr	1	His face was pale , almost sickly , like he was nervous .
tr	2	Or had he gotten involved in something he couldn 't get out of ?
tr	3	I breathed in and out trying not to cry and puke at the same time .
tr	3	If they tortured me , I couldn 't be as strong as Mom .
tr	2	A sob rose up from my chest causing my throat to burn .
tr	4	And I wasn 't even a real spy , just a determined teenager .
tr	1	I know , it 's so cliche , but what did he mean ?
tr	2	He was a little lost lamb grazing in a meadow filled with wild flowers .
tr	1	and other French niceties got lost in the crashing of pans and dishes .
tr	2	Young couples in love cast strange looks like I was a bit cuckoo .
tr	4	I let my head fall back and stared up between the tree branches .
tr	0	Spies act cool , calm , and suave in any and all dangerous situations .
tr	1	The blood raced beneath my skin , roiling and boiling at this boy 's balls .
tr	1	I whipped around in my seat , my glare piercing through his act .
tr	0	You can 't make this go away with a joke and a laugh . "
tr	3	I tried to distract you and to warn you to stay away .
tr	3	I might 've started it , but did he care about me at all ?
tr	3	Because at this point the friendship part was hurting a lot more .
tr	0	I was playing a game I knew nothing about and should 've stayed away from .
tr	2	When I looked back to the road , Malcolm had disappeared into the crowd .
tr	4	At some point in between sleep and wake I jolted up in bed .
tr	1	Heat pricked my skin , needles running up and down my arms .
tr	2	Finally , he looked at me but still couldn 't find my eyes .
tr	4	You could be back in the States next month or earlier . "
tr	2	How could I possibly tell him that mom probably wouldn 't answer the phone ?
tr	0	He sat on the bed and put his hand on my shoulder .
tr	4	He kissed my forehead , then he left with a fresh spring in his step .
tr	0	The wonderful , glorious black hat Dad gave me as a gift .
tr	0	The Extravaganza was this Saturday , the same exact time as Spy Games .
tr	4	The answer came quickly in the form of the person I 'd offended the worst .
tr	0	Thirty-six I had one day to train and be ready for Spy Games .
tr	2	I might not have done my job before , but I would do it now .
tr	4	Sweat soaked my shirt and dripped off the sides of my face .
tr	2	I hobbled back to my room and dragged the box out of my closet .
tr	1	With shaky fingers , I flicked it and a sharp knife popped out .
tr	3	Then I pulled out the switchblade and tucked it into my sock .
tr	4	Nancy and Malcolm entered from the side , with Frankie on their heels .
tr	3	Dad nodded at them as they took their spots around the table .
tr	1	My spy hat slipped , and I pushed it back into place .
tr	1	Minutes later , I was clicking into my cables and tightening the ropes .
tr	1	Frankie dropped down first then Nancy until it was Gray , Malcolm , and me .
tr	1	The small groups of musicians played music and whisked me back to the 1800s .
tr	3	And then , where I shot the guy with a tranquilizer dart .
tr	4	The wires that held the cupcakes were twisted and deformed with sharp edges sticking out .
tr	3	But the one that stayed with me , lodged in my throat , was fear .
tr	4	Instead , he unlocked the door and pushed me into the bakery .
tr	1	" It won 't be funny when you 're convicted and put in jail . "
tr	2	" I know he took Aimee 's spot to get to me . "
tr	3	I had my suspicions , but to hear it stated out loud made it real .
tr	1	His nostrils flared and his face turned the color of a brilliant sunset .
tr	4	A door creaked open , and he brought his face close to mine .
tr	1	Finally the world stopped spinning , and I lay on the floor .
tr	0	Cracks ran down the plastered walls and grit was on the floor .
tr	2	The room spun , and I waited for my vision to clear .
tr	0	I pulled a flashlight from my pack and made my way down .
tr	4	With one slice , his hands were free and then his feet .
tr	3	I pulled out a water bottle and held it up to his lips .
tr	0	I gently gripped his arm to help him stand and lead him away .
tr	1	His voice grew scratchy , probably from lack of talking during his captivity .
tr	4	I kept them to myself and did nothing because they made no sense .
tr	3	" I think the air down here has gotten to you . "
tr	2	The smell of body odor drifted off him , but I didn 't care .
tr	2	To run away , search for Mom , or to go get Dad .
tr	0	Then I could go into therapy and hypnosis and brainwash the memories away .
tr	4	The butler 's piercing black eyes caught mine , and he grinned .
tr	3	Thankfully the butler was probably better at serving pastries than shooting a gun .
tr	4	His chocolate eyes were kind , but reflected pain as he turned them on me .
tr	1	His body relaxed as his words poured forth , and peace spread across his face .
tr	1	She ripped the man 's shirt and pressed the napkins to his wounds .
tr	4	Her forehead creased in thought , like she had a lot to say to me .
tr	4	Her movements became fast and jerky , but she still did not answer .
tr	4	All I needed was proof , a real note , a goodbye , face-to-face .
tr	4	She wrapped the man 's wounds with precision , her lips pressed tight together .
tr	0	I managed to flip around and twist her arm behind her back .
tr	2	I lied to my dad and broke rules so I could find you .
tr	4	She rubbed the prisoner 's hand but her words were for me .
tr	3	My body sagged , and the last bit of anger trickled out .
tr	2	I thought your dad might pick up where your mom left off . "
tr	2	And then you started poking your nose around where you should not .
tr	2	I didn 't know whether to be furious , happy , or sad .
tr	4	He tried to talk but his words jumbled together and he spoke nonsense .
tr	1	A girl from a vision who he didn 't even know existed until today .
tr	1	" He is probably involved in something illegal but I know nothing about his business .
tr	2	Or maybe it was my mom who would be doing the killing .
tr	3	Forty-two The shot glanced off the wall with a spray of dust .
tr	1	The butler was crawling toward us , the revolver hanging from his hand .
tr	2	In my apartment , in my bedroom closet is a whole lot of cash .
tr	1	She was still my friend , and this was goodbye , possibly forever .
tr	0	I ran back through the tunnels , my thoughts confused , my heart aching .
tr	1	I couldn 't think about everything he 'd said , his visions , my death .
tr	3	I thought about the times I 'd zoned out at staff meetings .
tr	2	I thought about Jolie bragging how he was going to work for my dad .
tr	0	My dad had asked Jolie to be an informant and hand out clues ?
tr	1	Their greedy hands reached forward hoping to touch his apron or grab the clue .
tr	4	Red crept around the guy 's collar line and up his neck .
tr	2	" Do you have the guts to follow through , or should I ? "
tr	4	I crouched , but as I approached , men in tuxedos closed in on me .
tr	3	They couldn 't drag me away , not with Dad to protect me .
tr	3	" Please tell me you don 't have anything to do with this . "
tr	2	I searched his eyes , looking for some hint of understanding or compassion .
tr	3	And that man has been the most stubborn mule to work with .
tr	3	I tried to step back , but the wall of minions blocked my way .
tr	4	He searched the crowds , back and forth , until his eyes landed on me .
tr	0	I slowly faced him while the tray balanced precariously on my arm .
tr	4	He gripped a digital tape recorder and a pencil stuck out from behind his ear .
tr	3	" I do not have time for this petty back and forth . "
tr	4	The cake landed in Jolie 's beard and dripped onto the front of his shirt .
tr	2	A low growl sounded in his throat and rose to a loud pitch .
tr	3	I waited until the last second and then slammed the tray into his face .
tr	2	With one swoop , he grabbed a hunk of cake from the ground .
tr	2	Or talk about how we 'd work together to get Mom to come back .
tr	1	I collapsed to the ground and crept forward , painful inch by painful inch .
tr	1	This was not how I planned on spending my last minutes on earth .
tr	3	I struggled to get out of Malcolm 's clutches and mumbled empty threats .
tr	2	He pulled out a knife , and Dad 's words rolled through me .
tr	0	A shadow fell over us and a familiar voice tickled my ears .
tr	0	I called him in to distract and lead you away from Jolie . "
tr	4	He 'd pretended to romance me just to spy on my family .
tr	1	Forty-seven Malcolm didn 't answer me but sat with his arms resting on his knees .
tr	1	Those words danced in my head and in my heart , lifting my spirits .
tr	0	It was a carefully laid trap for your mom first and then you .
tr	1	" But why did you try and kill him if he was innocent ? "
tr	2	" He was probably aiming for you before you jumped on Jolie .
tr	3	That 's why she told me to burn the package , to not get involved .
tr	4	The whole scenario sounded like some unbelievable story that belonged on Dateline or something .
tr	0	His hands slid down my back to the hem of my shirt .
tr	2	" In my line of work , you can 't care about anyone too much .
tr	2	" That 's good , because I don 't care about you .
tr	3	The tears are purely a post-traumatic side effect of getting shot . "
tr	3	At least I was pretty sure my life wouldn 't end tonight .
tr	0	He pressed his mouth against mine harder , and a thrill ran through my insides .
tr	4	He pushed me back , kissed my cheek , and whispered in my ear .
tr	3	" I could 've told you that from our first date , " I teased .
tr	0	His face changed , from soft and passionate to hard and determined .
tr	2	" You didn 't think I 'd forget , did you ? "
tr	2	Fear rose in my throat and clamped down on my vocal chords .
tr	4	He started to leave , but I was still desperate for answers .
tr	1	When I first asked you out , I didn 't know any of this .
tr	0	I couldn 't easily forget that I was in my underwear and bra .
tr	1	I thought about summer nights in Pennsylvania after a tough afternoon of pulling weeds .
tr	4	Several cars screeched to a stop on the road next to me .
tr	3	A huge spotlight swept back and forth until it stopped on me .
tr	0	Rough hands grabbed at me until I was pushed into the car .
tr	3	" I thought I told you to burn the package and not get involved . "
tr	2	The cop took off her pointed hat and long brown hair spilled down her back .
tr	1	So many words burned in my throat , wanting to be spoken .
tr	0	In a few years they 'd be thanking us and laughing about it all .
tr	4	" Just a few more seconds , " she finally whispered back .
tr	0	My senior year is coming up and that means college applications . "
tr	0	Thank God I didn 't mention all our failed pranks this past year .
tr	2	I 'd hoped for some comfort food like cupcakes or homemade chocolate chip cookies .
tr	4	We are disappointed in your decision , and there will be consequences . "
tr	1	Support and respect for the copyrighted works of this author are greatly appreciated .
tr	3	The characters in this book are fictional products of the author 's imagination .
tr	4	" How in the hell are they getting those lids off ? "
tr	4	Steve Lyndon raised deep blue eyes to the dense forest that covered the north hillside .
tr	1	Back within minutes , Scott Lyndon was carrying a high caliber rifle in his hand .
tr	3	Scott snapped the rifle out of the clamp and aimed it toward the animal .
tr	4	As he neared the dozer the bear took a few steps forward then stopped .
tr	0	It wasn 't a sharp blow but it was enough to break my aim . "
tr	4	There 's no way in hell a bear could have opened them . "
tr	3	Your fiction mind is getting the better of you brother dear . "
tr	4	He focused on the shadow until it disappeared behind a stand of trees .
tr	3	Scott lost track of it then found it again several yards east .
tr	3	" Look out by the trash barrels , " Scott whispered softly .
tr	3	I was hoping to find out what it was without the light . "
tr	3	Instantly , the two images at the garbage can were illuminated by the light .
tr	1	" I 've read about this kind of thing happening but it was always fiction .
tr	3	He sat the tray on top of the third drum then went to bed .
tr	3	Scott stopped dead in his tracks and stared at the now empty tray .
tr	3	Scott laid the apple on top of the third drum then returned to the house .
tr	2	" I think you 've taken care of both of those concerns . "
tr	3	Scott stayed motionless in hopes of not antagonizing either the little girl or her watchdog .
tr	0	He saw her gaze jet to the bag and back again and he smiled .
tr	3	Scott was sure the bear was only issuing a warning but it did not matter .
tr	3	Only then did he return to the safety of the truck cab .
tr	2	" It took a lot of guts to face down a bear . "
tr	3	After they returned to camp Scott went straight to the office and began his investigation .
tr	2	His gaze drifted to one of only two windows in the office .
tr	3	" I just can 't see that little girl in a cage .
tr	3	That little dress or shirt she had on was awfully tattered and dirty . "
tr	3	Although I 'm not sure she 'd be willing to take something like that .
tr	3	Scott grinned then sat the tray on the desk in front of his brother .
tr	2	" What are you going to do if you do win her trust ? "
tr	3	" I think she wants our help , " Scott told his brother .
tr	4	In the blue pickup the two men steered it toward the north ridge road .
tr	3	If not for the severity of the situation Scott would have laughed .
tr	0	The coyote lifted its head and growled at the man , baring sharp fangs .
tr	3	Scott frowned as he watched the little girl go to the coyote .
tr	3	" Not with a wild coyote up there I won 't . "
tr	1	To his surprise the bear dropped back to all fours and sank to its haunches .
tr	3	Scott pulled on the thick leather logging gloves and tightened the wrist straps .
tr	0	" Doug , go back in the barn and stay there . "
tr	2	" Do you think you should clean that wound out first ? "
tr	4	But all we have is either water or peroxide , both of which would sting .
tr	0	He was back a minute later with a basin of fresh water .
tr	3	When the animal whined softly Scott said , " Its ok fella .
tr	0	He heard nothing unusual and when he reached the drums , he saw nothing unusual .
tr	4	He dumped out the water then laid the pan under the porch .
tr	3	Scott called to the man in the middle of the logs . "
tr	2	" Did he try pulling his foot out of his boot ? "
tr	3	He can 't get down in there far enough to get to the boot . "
tr	4	One matchstick at a time and if we take the wrong one Chet loses . "
tr	0	Even though most black bears looked alike there was something familiar about this particular bear .
tr	4	There was a rustle in the underbrush and the little girl appeared .
tr	3	" We need to get him out but it will take time . "
tr	3	The little girl took another step forward and held out her hand again .
tr	3	He looked at the boot that was still wedged in the bear trap .
tr	0	" So she paid you back the same way , " the foreman said .
tr	0	I don 't think he 'll hurt you as long as you stay away . "
tr	3	It was a tiny voice and one that Scott thought might belong to an angel .
tr	3	Scott slid his gaze back to the little girl and her outstretched , upturned hand .
tr	3	Eight steps later and the little girl stopped in front of him .
tr	0	" I don 't know what you want , " he said almost sadly .
tr	3	It came out broken into two distinct syllables but Scott understood it and he smiled .
tr	3	If they had gotten this far Scott wondered how much further they could get .
tr	4	" They will have to ride back here , " he told her .
tr	1	He was in unfamiliar territory now and on land owned by the federal government .
tr	4	It was set aside as a nature preserve and off limits to people and vehicles .
tr	1	It was mostly deep rolling hills on this side of the terrain .
tr	3	He lifted the binoculars , brought them into focus and looked at the objects again .
tr	4	Sidney looked back at Scott and held up her hand , spreading her fingers .
tr	2	" Do you ever go down and see your Mommy and Daddy ? "
tr	2	" Yeah , at the bottom of a two hundred foot gorge . "
tr	3	She nodded then turned and started down the path again with Scott right behind her .
tr	0	The path was a gradual one that wove along the hillside much like a switchback .
tr	4	If they encountered anything in the gorge , they would be well-protected .
tr	3	Although it was not a rattlesnake Scott realized the coyote was taking no chances .
tr	3	Less than twenty minutes later the coyote stopped and dropped to its haunches .
tr	4	He tried to read the store name on the receipt but it was too faded .
tr	3	Scott closed that pocket and went to the next only to find it empty .
tr	3	Scott pulled the nametag paper out , turned it over and found a price tag .
tr	0	He reached down and picked up a locket that was dangling from a golden chain .
tr	3	He looked at the little girl that was moving along the rocks .
tr	0	" Mommy and Daddy aren 't going to wake up are they . "
tr	2	" Your Mommy and Daddy are going to sleep for a really long time . "
tr	2	He took the locket and , opening it , looked at the two photos inside .
tr	4	" She said she sleeps with the bear and the coyote visits her .
tr	3	" I want to try to find out if she has any family . "
tr	3	But what if the sheriff finds out they had a little girl with them ? "
tr	4	I guess I 'll have to cross that bridge when I get there . "
tr	2	Scott nodded and displayed the clothes he had draped over his arm .
tr	2	" Howdy boys , " Josh Logan called as he unfolded himself from the squad .
tr	3	" Something 's up on that bank , " he told the driver .
tr	4	As the camp came into view Scott looked at the garbage drums and he smiled .
tr	1	" Is it ok if I look in Daddy 's wallet ? "
tr	4	He flipped the cellophane leaf and saw a picture of a much younger Sidney .
tr	2	More gas receipts ; one from a station in Colorado and two from Nevada .
tr	4	We have purchased an inexpensive motorhome and placed all of our earthly belongings in it .
tr	2	Much of that part of her childhood was erased from her memory now .
tr	0	A gold , heart-shaped locket hung on a gold chain around her neck .
tr	4	During the winter they would make deals and plans for the following season .
tr	1	Scott was all smiles at the sheriff 's lack of fear of the coyotes .
tr	0	" I 'm afraid this ain 't exactly a social call fellas . "
tr	1	" I 'm sure Sid could set him in his place . "
tr	3	Chapter 9 Scott awoke to what sounded like a distant rifle shot .
tr	0	He saw the blonde who was dressed in black pajamas stop near a window .
tr	2	She still had too much wild blood in her to be stopped .
tr	4	He felt her arms go around him and felt her shoulders tremble .
tr	4	She was staring down into her cup and looked up when he entered .
tr	4	The sheriff jammed his thumb over his shoulder , aiming at the dead coyote outside .
tr	2	" Damn , " Josh said and pulled a notebook out of his pocket .
tr	0	I didn 't have a good angle and it was too dark . "
tr	4	He tapped the brim of his hat in salute then headed for the door .
tr	1	Everything had been quiet and had returned to normal at Lyndon Logging .
tr	3	He watched the man get out of the truck and come toward him .
tr	0	" I just wanted to make amends , " he managed through his parched throat .
tr	1	Dan Jansen blinked back at the innocence before his gaze shifted to Sidney Lyndon again .
tr	2	Any fight he 'd had in him drained away as did his desire to stand .
tr	1	" You can survive in the big city , " Sidney shot back .
tr	2	" How does it feel to have no place to go ? "
tr	1	Dan Jansen was not the kind of man who cared to take orders from anyone .
tr	1	It was evident in his eyes , in his face , and in his voice .
tr	4	He wondered if his sister had seen it ; was pretty sure she had .
tr	4	The man to her left gave her a quizzical glance then looked at the animals .
tr	3	Although they were still watching him , they were not in attack position now .
tr	0	Dan Jansen looked at the massive black bear again then looked down at the pup .
tr	3	" It 's usually more lively but it was interrupted tonight . "
tr	2	Sidney rose onto the porch and took the pup from the man .
tr	2	" There is room for all of us to live in this world . "
tr	1	" I didn 't mean ... " " I know what you meant . "
tr	1	I planned on selling the ranch and moving back to the city .
tr	4	Dan Jansen watched the red dot disappear behind a patch of dense underbrush .
tr	2	One sound from her and those coyotes would have run you off the place . "
tr	3	Scott Lyndon smiled at the group that was racing across the distant hillside .
tr	0	He had several scratches on his face , mostly from running through the heavy brush .
tr	0	J.T. " Chapter 1 -- Alex Friday , May 11 -- Southern Virginia .
tr	4	The sheer white curtains fluffed in and out in rhythm with the breeze .
tr	2	She had a fluffy , frilly bed with matching desk , dresser and nightstand .
tr	4	Her emerald eyes looked wide awake , but her short brown hair was a mess .
tr	1	" Father 's intuition , " he said , shrugging playfully as he finished pouring .
tr	1	" You know that 's second in the nation in my age group ? "
tr	2	You know that 's my favorite ... " " Like your dad , eh ? "
tr	2	" Honey , I 'm just worried that you 're working too hard .
tr	2	Are you going to force me to play with dolls or something ? "
tr	1	I don 't like everything you do ; I just like swimming ! "
tr	3	" Now I got ta hurry up and get to practice . "
tr	2	He laid out some clothes and headed downstairs to Anna 's room .
tr	4	As he started cracking the eggs in the skillet , Jessica came down the stairs .
tr	4	Anna considered her answer a moment before answering , " Four . "
tr	2	Rick chuckled and shook his head before continuing down the stairs without comment .
tr	2	" Don 't you ever look at your time , Alex ? "
tr	2	I told you 29 seconds isn 't far away for you ! "
tr	4	Chelsea raised the corner of her lip as well as an eyebrow at her .
tr	2	" Don 't give me that look , you 're not done improving .
tr	0	She watched him carefully , guessing he was going to chastise her for her thoughts .
tr	3	A large boy stood up then , " What did they eat ? "
tr	1	" Were the kids of normal families forced to marry strangers too ? "
tr	1	" OK , class , let 's try to answer all of these questions .
tr	4	I 'm sure some of these answers will be very difficult to dredge up .
tr	2	I 'll make a deal with you all though , OK ? "
tr	1	Does anyone want to do the assignment I had originally planned for today ? "
tr	3	The bell then rang and the kids all started to get up .
tr	4	If everyone puts out enough effort , we 'll quit then . "
tr	4	Her team gathered around her and cheered , taunting the starting players .
tr	1	" You 're in high jump tomorrow Jenkins , " the coach said dismissively .
tr	3	Then she started to get the hang of it and cleared it easily two times .
tr	2	I think you 're ready for tomorrow , don 't you ? "
tr	3	I think we can still win that without you , and put you in both .
tr	3	It was a beautiful sight and worth it to dawdle along the path .
tr	1	She chipped some of it away but decided to finish digging it out first .
tr	4	Jodie was upset with her performance as she climbed out after her turn .
tr	4	Alex tried consoling her because she was the youngest in her age group .
tr	3	How many points have I contributed to the team this year , hmmm ? "
tr	1	You 're fifth in breast and fly , and moving up in all of them .
tr	0	Wait until Monday when coach times us again , you 'll see ! "
tr	0	Jodie was starting to understand as Alex demonstrated what each muscle did .
tr	1	She weighed it in her hands , " It 's light , like aluminum ! "
tr	1	The only one that didn 't change was a big spiral on one side .
tr	3	" I thought that 's what it was when I first saw it . "
tr	3	" I 'm going to take it home and let my dad check it out .
tr	0	Jodie finished drying her hair and sat on the bench to pull out her brush .
tr	0	But if this was her home , he had fatherly duties to do .
tr	3	" So , chatterbox , what is it you want from me ? "
tr	4	" Put those in that dish when you 're done , " he ordered .
tr	2	" I 'm going to chop up some onions to put in the beans .
tr	4	He studied the picture closely , " That one looks like a ball of string .
tr	1	" We found an ancient Roman drawing with kids in the background playing soccer ! "
tr	2	" Wow , I didn 't even know you could high jump .
tr	1	" No , silly , I didn 't know I could either .
tr	2	It smells sooooo good in here , " groaned Jessica , rubbing her stomach .
tr	3	" Well , OK , I guess we 'll just have to start without her .
tr	1	It 's so ... light ... but so ... hard , so ... weird ! "
tr	4	she said , uninterested in the cube , but intently eyeing the grub .
tr	4	" And I see some that I have no clue what they are !
tr	3	Christy picked up a roll and started to throw it at her .
tr	2	To one side stood a fully stocked fridge and bar with four stools .
tr	0	" This ... " He stuck out his hand and Anna handed him the cube .
tr	0	" Thanks , Abby , " Rick said sarcastically instead of answering her .
tr	1	Do you think we would have as much fun without your dad there ? "
tr	3	" Yes , this is Rick , glad to meet you , Walt . "
tr	4	Alex stuck her tongue out at Kaylie , for teasing her about her future theory .
tr	1	It all starts to make perfect sense now , as impossible as that seems .
tr	2	" I 'm gon na shove it up your -- " " Stop ! "
tr	3	" I want to know what 's in it , " Alex stated .
tr	1	" I think I can answer those questions ... " Kaylie submitted confidently .
tr	3	" Go to the future first and tell us what this thing is ! "
tr	4	The girls quickly ushered her in and guided her down the stairs .
tr	0	All seams vanished as if on command , forming a smooth surface .
tr	4	He held it and closed his fingers around it ; it seemed to radiate heat .
tr	3	" Maybe we shouldn 't touch this stuff , Dad , " Alex timidly protested .
tr	1	Under the tangle was a coin -- a shiny and barely worn gold coin .
tr	2	" So like , uh , what do we do now ? "
tr	1	He possessed small , almost squinting eyes compared to his bushy brown eyebrows .
tr	3	" This is it , the first test of the Universal Chronicler .
tr	0	" Amazing , " said Abby in awe , followed by similar comments by all .
tr	0	" I don 't know what to think , " he shook his head .
tr	2	Dr. Taylor had evidently just selected to record and shut down the display .
tr	1	" Not ... gon na ... make ... it , " he panted .
tr	3	Rick strode to the computer and settled comfortably into his cushioned chair .
tr	1	" OK , I don 't see anything ... " " My coin ? "
tr	0	" Waterways can change drastically in 250 years , " was Rob 's easy reply .
tr	0	As far as I can tell , that is their only holding .
tr	2	Both girls nodded , gave him hugs and kisses , and plodded up the stairs .
tr	3	Let 's eat and enjoy it now though , while it lasts .
tr	2	Alex stood next , reaching for some food to dish out for them .
tr	2	Is someone going to chew our food for us as well ? "
tr	2	Christy snickered and added , " I 'm supposed to wipe your mouth . "
tr	3	It 's imperative that you accept that and do not trouble me about it further .
tr	3	Understand that it 's not for sale , at any price , period ! "
tr	0	He finally said to the old man , " What do you mean ?
tr	1	It was started with ten million dollars , and always growing with inflation .
tr	3	No , can 't say that I do ; don 't care either .
tr	4	They offered me four million to sell the land a while back .
tr	2	" Goodbye , Mr. Johnson , thanks again for your time ! "
tr	3	They sat silently for a minute , waiting for the events to start .
tr	2	How about we go get some hot dogs and drinks and candy ? "
tr	1	I -- " He burst into laughter , " I 'm joking honey !
tr	0	He and Jessica strolled back through the crowd and sat back down beside Abby .
tr	1	Coach said to join my family if I wanted until then ! "
tr	1	" You think I can win all five , Uncle Ricky ? "
tr	0	" Whatcha gon na do , beat me up , Uncle Ricky ? "
tr	3	" Dish it out , but can 't take it , eh , buttercup ? "
tr	3	" You don 't , you just act like it , " Jessica told him .
tr	2	" Look for more cavemen , I 'm fascinated by evolution ! "
tr	4	" One more , then we get to pick some , " Christy agreed .
tr	2	The majority of workers stopped and focused suddenly on a single point .
tr	1	Anna was thirty yards from the finish line when Rick 's phone rang .
tr	1	Anna has another race in ten minutes , can 't you just explain it ? "
tr	2	" Maybe not , but remember what you said about your own childhood ?
tr	2	Your mother let you take your own chances and learn from your mistakes .
tr	1	" Time to go , " he said as soon as she answered .
tr	4	" OK Dad , we 're coming , " she easily agreed .
tr	4	He watched them get out and walk to where he sat with Abby and Jessica .
tr	3	" I thought her last event was the 100 , " Kaylie stated .
tr	1	" Yeah , but it was mostly the stuffy upper class , " Christy said .
tr	3	I don 't want you getting too worked up over all this stuff . "
tr	1	" We will find it , today , " Kaylie confidently promised .
tr	3	" That 's not fair -- it 's just across the street ! "
tr	4	She lowered her head , " Sorry , I am glad you care .
tr	2	" This guy is a lot younger though -- I don 't know .
tr	1	They found Abby and Christy sitting on the sidelines on a blanket and joined them .
tr	1	Chapter 10 -- Some Things Aren 't So Easy " You stink ! "
tr	2	Rick admonished , " You know she 's been running for almost two hours .
tr	1	A muffled affirmation came from Kaylie 's mouth , " Me too ! "
tr	0	Christy asked as he handed her an outfit that was way too big .
tr	1	" If you get hit by it , our trip is certainly over ! "
tr	2	Nobody lags behind -- if you need to stop , make it known . "
tr	1	She let it fall to the ground and grinned , unfazed by his antics .
tr	2	Rick imagined it would be almost impossible to walk up the loose rock .
tr	0	She drew a huge A , nearly a foot tall , on a nearby rock .
tr	3	" I want you to take a picture of every intersection and pathway . "
tr	3	" Don 't forget to mark ... " he started to say .
tr	2	If they had poured concrete floors it wouldn 't be any smoother .
tr	3	" OK girls , it 's a disappointment , but we 're not through yet .
tr	2	Anna joked , not looking forward to the long , sad walk back .
tr	3	" What do you think they did with all the rock from those tunnels ?
tr	1	It didn 't take long to discover she was sprawled across his bed .
tr	1	" I 'll be waiting , " she said , turning to wink slyly .
tr	2	" I was looking for you while Alex took her bath . "
tr	1	" Mmmm , that sounds really nice , can I come with you ? "
tr	1	It didn 't fool Kaylie a bit , but she let him think it did .
tr	2	Go get on your suit , and bring your own rubber ducky , OK ?
tr	3	During his internal struggle , he had almost forgotten ... " Oh , Abby ! "
tr	0	" That 's really a nice suit , Kaylie , " Abby said casually .
tr	3	It looks nice ; let 's leave it at that , OK ? "
tr	4	Alex popped her head in the door , " There you are !
tr	3	Rick questioned , still startled by her abrupt departure from the tub .
tr	4	Dripping wet , she grabbed a towel on her way out the door .
tr	1	She was carrying a printout of the map from the drawing , very much enlarged .
tr	0	Abby nodded emphatically as she grabbed Rick 's arm , attempting to pull him out .
tr	4	" Alex , can you tape these up under the floodlights ? "
tr	3	Kaylie brought the third enormous print and held it for Alex to tape .
tr	4	He held the cube beside it , " The vortex is the key ! "
tr	1	" I don 't think I could sleep right now , " Kaylie said .
tr	3	We can 't sit on the couch in wet bathing suits , doofus ! "
tr	4	She had been rambling on for thirty minutes or more , completely starry-eyed .
tr	2	You 're really cool when you 're not trying to be an old fart ! "
tr	2	Come on , what would you like to do with a time machine ? "
tr	4	She giggled , " It 's just nice to see you so excited .
tr	1	But it was because my love then was swimming -- that was my passion .
tr	3	We 're not watching this movie and you 're starting to look tired .
tr	4	Jess , go get Anna up ; Alex , go get Kaylie . "
tr	1	" It jiggles like jello when you hit it with a sandal ! "
tr	3	Christy and Jessica galloped straight to the van , forgetting their shoes .
tr	3	Christy broke the spell , " Wow , it 's so pretty ! "
tr	0	Alex , who had gasped , was now tugging at his arm as well .
tr	1	Kaylie proclaimed as she sat down to take off her shoes and socks .
tr	0	Along the far wall appeared to be a slanted desk full of large papers .
tr	4	Hook , line and sinker , Kaylie smiled inwardly as she reeled her in .
tr	1	" It just scared me , " Kaylie said , indicating the rope .
tr	1	she was yelling at him , splashing him with fists in the water .
tr	4	" Please , identify yourself , voice unrecognized , " it answered .
tr	2	" Hello , Rick , will you be controlling displacement parameters ? "
tr	2	" Would you like to manually or verbally choose a location , Rick ? "
tr	2	Would you like to share or give control to Alex , Rick ? "
tr	2	" Would you like to allow anyone else to share control , Rick ? "
tr	1	Rick thought the machine had a hint of loneliness in its voice .
tr	2	Rick decided to ask , " Do you know what happened to John ? "
tr	3	" Yes , sorry , T. " " That 's quite all right , Rick .
tr	2	" Wait ... you hold all of history ... in memory ? "
tr	2	The girls were all sitting on the floor now , almost completely dry .
tr	1	" On the contrary , I can never be anything but serious , Anna . "
tr	3	" Can we be ... displaced to that time , T ? "
tr	2	Would you like to learn about my memory technology now , Rick ? "
tr	3	It rotated in front of them , filling most of the five-foot display .
tr	3	" But you 're not permitted to answer that either , are you ? "
tr	2	" You mentioned you can actually locate a person , correct ? "
tr	1	He was sitting on a stool in his room , apparently having his hair styled .
tr	2	Rick asked , " Can you show me his room , T ? "
tr	0	and was rewarded with an instant display of Octavian 's sleeping quarters .
tr	4	T , give me a Whopper with cheese and extra tomato , " he ordered .
tr	4	" Yes , please , and a Sierra Mist , too , " he added .
tr	2	Rick cautiously walked to it and opened a door on the side .
tr	1	" Would you like it with or without commercials , Rick ? "
tr	4	And I 'm not sure if we should even be doing it . "
tr	0	" Stop , T , play at half speed , forward , " Alex commanded .
tr	1	" Historians always describe Octavian as ' very feminine ' , " Rick told her .
tr	4	" Do we need to guess what happened to this missing time , T ? "
tr	0	" He hasn 't taken it off in five days , Dad . "
tr	4	T , share control with Kaylie , please , " he directed .
tr	2	" You 're not going wearing those goofy shorts , are you ? "
tr	0	He looked down at his Hawaiian print , bright yellow shorts , " Hmmm .
tr	1	They finally settled on one each , opening and calling out what they found .
tr	2	" If we called our parents , you know they would say it 's OK .
tr	3	" We don 't have anything to cut the shirts with . "
tr	1	Anna cringed , " I don 't think I want to go now ! "
tr	0	I bet that 's lower than playground accident rates and much safer than gymnastics ! "
tr	1	" OK , " Rick said , " I 'll make this easy .
tr	2	You give me a good reason why I should let you go ? "
tr	2	And I would just have to worry about you the whole time . "
tr	2	And if you don 't like it , you won 't go . "
tr	2	" How will we know if they are willing to sell it ? "
tr	0	Abby wrapped her arms around him , " And what chore do I get ? "
tr	2	" Is that an invitation to move in , or a proposal ? "
tr	2	I think we found a good home , too , " Kaylie said .
tr	3	" Jess , you want to take a swim with me ? "
tr	0	Abby , Jessica and Anna all stepped back after giving everyone a quick hug .
tr	1	Rick nervously stood with his arms crossed ; the girls all held hands firmly .
tr	2	The younger brother was a carbon copy of his older sibling , only smaller .
tr	1	The little boy 's shoulder strap was ripped and hung down across his chest .
tr	1	" Yes , yes they are silk -- " Christy started to say .
tr	3	he pointed , then stood with arms crossed , impatiently waiting for an answer .
tr	4	Lucius attempted to defy his sister once more , " Mother will be furious ! "
tr	3	My father told me I could wait until we get settled in Rome though .
tr	0	" Oh , yeah , we should hurry , " Christy added .
tr	1	He quickly dragged the tunic over his head , finding it fit surprisingly well .
tr	3	Christy soaked up all the information she could about the sports they played .
tr	0	She tapped Rick 's arm and asked if she could go play .
tr	2	he ordered as he tried to follow the guards without looking too obvious .
tr	0	If he had any hair , it was hidden under his helmet .
tr	0	He gathered his thoughts as he heard the captain speaking in praise of him .
tr	3	Rick clasped his hand over the little girl 's mouth , nodding at the guard .
tr	1	He awkwardly struggled around the corner before another arrow could be flung in his direction .
tr	1	She also gave some small boys with distended stomachs part of their fruit .
tr	0	" Who was that man shooting at us , and why ? "
tr	0	" Are you still mad at me for stealing it back ? "
tr	1	Rick went to check again and saw nobody but a couple drunken soldiers .
tr	0	When they neared her home , a light was shining through the window .
tr	1	Is it OK if I run ahead so she knows I 'm all right ? "
tr	4	She giggled and reached her free arm around him for another hug .
tr	0	Rick could see Abby , flanked by Jessica and Anna , fading into view .
tr	2	" I 'm OK , but you should see the lion , " Rick joked .
tr	2	" You 're lucky he didn 't use poison , you fool !
tr	0	" It 's a real authentic Roman Republic tunic that a real kid wore ! "
tr	0	Abby 's archaeologist persona kicked in and Rick 's wound became unimportant to her .
tr	2	" I 'll be good to go in -- " " Rick ? "
tr	3	But there 's still three more , so that 's only a start .
tr	3	Rick wanted to comfort her , but couldn 't manage to get up .
tr	3	" T , play the last ten seconds of that again , " Kaylie instructed .
tr	4	She became enraged , crying , " You don 't even care about her !
tr	3	She threw the tunic in his face and stomped off to the bathroom .
tr	4	He could see her smiling face ; saw her bouncing off down the street .
tr	1	With anguish on his face , Rick knelt down in front of her .
tr	3	" You can 't carry me with that hurt leg , Rick . "
tr	2	" OK , I 'll snoop through those while you search online , OK ? "
tr	2	" OK , we 're going to have to discuss this tomorrow .
tr	1	" I think you should tell them , " Rick said with a smile .
tr	0	" You girls aren 't happy about this , are you ? "
tr	0	That launched a barrage of questions that made Rick forget Abby 's original inquiry .
tr	3	" Why would they make it look natural , and put supports in it ? "
tr	2	Christy got above him on the ramp and jumped onto his back .
tr	3	He patiently sat on the bottom until she was forced to come up for air .
tr	1	I 'm the best swimmer and I 'm trained in lifesaving . "
tr	3	It was definitely cooler in the grotto and Rick was starting to shiver uncontrollably .
tr	2	" You know you can do this tomorrow , " she still insisted .
tr	4	The ride home gave me a chance to rest and recover some strength . "
tr	1	" I will in a minute , soon as I finish reading this . "
tr	0	His older daughter , Alex , really had found an obscure and intriguing artifact .
tr	4	He held out his hand and Jessica deposited the crystal in it .
tr	4	They whined and complained about being tired , but did as they were told .
tr	0	He was average height and had a generally serious , but approachable look .
tr	0	Her hair was straight , silky and jet black , her eyes dark as midnight .
tr	0	I thought you said this one was it , " she challenged .
tr	3	" But , it could contaminate the ... " he started to protest .
tr	0	As Samantha finished her script , the camera switched focus to Jordan .
tr	1	Now in his sixties , he was by far the oldest anchor still on HV .
tr	1	" I was serious , " she informed him with a straight face .
tr	2	This ebook may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	1	Margaret continued to scream , finally undoing her belt and falling out of the plane .
tr	1	Wind pushed down on her - the down blast from large wings .
tr	4	The dragon was red as blood - covered in glistening , metallic scales .
tr	3	Finally , it made its mind up about what to do with Margaret .
tr	4	The leader of the pack , Carlos , topped a rise at full speed .
tr	4	The bikers stopped a dozen feet from the edge of the burnt wreckage .
tr	2	Long black hair spilled out of her helmet as she took it off .
tr	0	Most of it was melted now , revealing an aluminum frame and railings .
tr	1	Now she could also see part of the man 's head was missing .
tr	2	Another of the boys , Kendall , looked around at the sky .
tr	2	It remained motionless , more and more ash and soot washing off .
tr	2	A silent figure of stone with one boot and black , cargo pocket pants .
tr	1	The stone man suddenly sat up - his mouth opening wide and gasping for air .
tr	3	The teens changed out of wet clothes , trading riding jackets for dry t-shirts .
tr	4	She took a long drink from her water bottle and remained quiet .
tr	4	They guys would think she was crazy , but Josie knew what she had seen .
tr	2	Logan moved a little closer toward Josie , a big grin on his face .
tr	1	He was more than tired of all the flirting Logan did with Josie .
tr	4	Jimmy watched his best friend closely for several seconds as she stared into the fire .
tr	4	No sooner was he on his feet than he collapsed to his knees .
tr	3	This time , the man was able to stay on his feet .
tr	0	But he had to hold his pants up with his right hand .
tr	2	He looked around , panting lightly from the exertion of his long walk .
tr	0	A small , metal can lay on the ground near a tent .
tr	4	The plastic bottle flexed in the man 's hand and he seemed taken aback .
tr	3	Then he grabbed the cap with his teeth and twisted it off .
tr	4	Her step-father told her it was the fireman coming out in her .
tr	3	This time she recognized it - an empty water bottle falling against another .
tr	1	And hanging from the chain , a gold , Christian fish pendant .
tr	3	The man put the bottle to his lips and began to drink .
tr	2	On his head , hair began to grow - jet black in color .
tr	0	" Calm down , son , " the black-haired water thief said calmly .
tr	4	He then extended a hand , as if to help the teen up .
tr	0	This was a bullet-proof man that had come back from the dead .
tr	0	And Logan had been thrown through the air like a rag doll .
tr	2	Not bad enough to come out from behind his rock , but bad .
tr	4	The head wound - which wasn 't very deep at all - had closed up .
tr	0	Logan was laying on a collapsed tent , where Mark had thrown him .
tr	2	" Relax sport , I 'm not going to hurt you . "
tr	1	" I don 't think anything 's broken - maybe just bruised .
tr	3	We ought to wrap the ribs ... you have any first aid kits ? "
tr	0	Josie leaned back a bit , looking at the cut on Mark 's back .
tr	1	She uncapped it and started pouring water on the wound as the conversation continued .
tr	0	Carlos and Kendall stepped around Mark , watching Josie pouring water on the cut .
tr	4	" You weren 't exactly moving , dude , " Carlos remarked .
tr	1	Jimmy did not like Josie touching all over the shirtless man with the bulging muscles .
tr	0	" Okay , so your name is Mark , " Josie said , calmly .
tr	0	Kendall was shocked , but snatched out his hand and grabbed at the bill .
tr	0	Like it was only a few years ago - not more than sixty .
tr	4	Josie reached over and took the one-hundred out of Kendall 's hand .
tr	1	" That 's a 2011 bill , " Josie said , ignoring Kendall .
tr	1	He stood up , almost subconsciously running a thumb over his new wedding band .
tr	4	" You mean , how 'd I get this when we 're never apart ? "
tr	4	Mark pulled the necklace from its box and slipped it over his head .
tr	1	" Thanks - I like it , " Mark said , smiling at his wife .
tr	0	Maria and Mark exchanged worried glances , then Mark all but ran for the phone .
tr	0	Maria moved away from the breakfast table and all but sprinted for the door .
tr	3	" So you want me to go kill it and cut out its eye ? "
tr	3	This was a test of his abilities he didn 't really want to take .
tr	4	Everything he might need to fight his way to the surface in any circumstance .
tr	1	He fired a quick burst at the side of the basilisk facing him .
tr	0	Maria aimed and fired her shotgun as the basilisk began running toward them .
tr	0	Mark decided this was a bad plan and it was time to change it .
tr	2	All he could do was turn his head enough to look into the elevator .
tr	2	She had to hold on to the open doors of the elevator to stay standing .
tr	1	He was in agonizing pain - the fire had finally reached his flesh .
tr	1	The hot sun beat down on his tan skin and his fish pendant necklace .
tr	0	Mark walked over to the struggling Jimmy and put a hand on his shoulder .
tr	3	Carlos stomped around the trailer , to the cab of the truck .
tr	3	He pulled out a black t-shirt and stormed over to Mark with it .
tr	2	" I don 't get it , " Mark said , looking back to Carlos .
tr	0	" No - I mean , why do you have such big shirts ? "
tr	3	Jimmy finally managed to get Josie 's motorcycle up into the truck .
tr	2	" How come you don 't put your hair up in curlers , too ? "
tr	1	His face was turning red - partly from anger , partly from embarrassment .
tr	2	Carlos also got in , riding in back , while Logan rode shotgun .
tr	2	" Sorry I shot down your summer vacation , boys , " he said .
tr	0	Mark turned and walked away from the truck , back towards Josie and Jimmy .
tr	2	" Hope you get your memory back , " Kendall mockingly said .
tr	2	" Why didn 't you ask for his autograph , too ? "
tr	4	" We 're just going to leave them out here with that freak ? "
tr	0	Mark was looking back at the wreckage now , as he spoke .
tr	0	A harness of some type that had supported a lot of gear .
tr	1	Josie and Jimmy stood quietly , side by side , watching Mark .
tr	1	She didn 't know why , but she didn 't feel in any danger .
tr	4	Josie looked at Jimmy as though he were an escapee from a mental institution .
tr	1	" Procedure would be for me to report in , " Mark stubbornly said .
tr	0	We have a big house - you can stay with us . "
tr	1	I don 't want to put you kids in any danger . "
tr	0	" Well , this was a good idea , " Carlos said sarcastically .
tr	0	A tall , black man with a shaved head , also wearing sunglasses .
tr	2	" So , where do you boys think your friends are now ? "
tr	0	Mark himself was later accepted into West Point , and graduated in 1950 .
tr	2	She couldn 't understand why he so obviously didn 't like Mark .
tr	1	" It 's okay , " Mark said , reaching into his pocket .
tr	2	Only a month or two later , more superheroes began coming out of the woodwork .
tr	2	Hollywood was accused of covering this up to keep raking in the money .
tr	1	A military helicopter gunship had to come in to drive him away .
tr	4	Josie rolled her eyes , then turned around to face the locals .
tr	2	Pete took his hat off long enough to wipe sweat off his brow .
tr	1	He felt like throwing up , and his vision swirled a little .
tr	2	Cletus , still doubled over , couldn 't tell what had happened .
tr	2	And now the local was trying to pick himself up from the ground .
tr	3	If Jimmy didn 't like Mark , he 'd think that was pretty darned cool .
tr	3	They staggered over to the front of the gas station 's store .
tr	0	Jimmy nodded affirmatively as Mark started walking over toward Cletus and Pete .
tr	3	Pete just stood there , slack-jawed , not sure what to do next .
tr	0	As Pete stepped forward , Mark shot out a quick jabbing punch .
tr	1	The punch then continued on , square into Pete 's mouth and nose .
tr	0	A Sergeant in camouflage ACU uniform approached Campbell , holding a tablet computer .
tr	2	" Another local police report in Arizona , " Sgt. Brown explained .
tr	2	" How do we know this isn 't some random Titan ? "
tr	1	Josie slid across the seat behind Jimmy , exiting on his side of the truck .
tr	3	Josie got far more attention , in her leather jacket , short-shorts and sandals .
tr	2	He too hated shopping - something Josie was always making him do .
tr	1	If Mark was really born in 1928 , he would probably dress like her grandpa .
tr	4	Mark went into a dressing room to try on the clothes Josie had selected .
tr	3	" I just don 't want to see you get hurt . "
tr	0	Nothing like the canvas high tops he 'd worn in the ' 50s .
tr	1	It 's like you get to discover things all over again . "
tr	3	She moved it toward his face , trying to get him to try it .
tr	3	Jimmy was about to take a bite of his burger , but stopped .
tr	4	Oh , and they 've changed the formula a few times over the years . "
tr	1	she asked , putting a hand on Mark 's shoulder in concern .
tr	0	" Had a flash , " Mark said , sitting up straight .
tr	1	" I think we need to talk in private , sir . "
tr	2	" Besides , I don 't really know how this phone of theirs works . "
tr	2	" Okay , so I 'm a Colonel and you 're a Major .
tr	3	So I guess I can ORDER you to start talking , right ? "
tr	1	" Sir , time is critical in this matter , " Campbell said .
tr	1	" There are a lot of innocent civilians there - including your companions . "
tr	1	Mark sipped his drink , staring straight ahead , past Jimmy , seemingly at nothing .
tr	4	Like a crazy person might give - right before they killed you .
tr	0	" That was a long time ago , Colonel , " Jimmy said .
tr	1	And I wouldn 't say this is entirely against his will . "
tr	0	Josie had grown up almost part of Jimmy 's family after her dad died .
tr	4	" These men are here to assist you in getting there . "
tr	3	He then touched the stun gun to Jimmy 's forehead and activated it .
tr	0	Again , there was the flare of ghostly green light around Mark 's hand .
tr	4	Mark popped a couple more chicken tenders in his mouth , then finished his drink .
tr	3	" I 'm going to stand up , " Mark told the scared agent .
tr	0	Agent Cooper swallowed and nodded an affirmative to the agents around him .
tr	4	" Yes , sir , " Cooper said respectfully , and stepped aside .
tr	0	" Apparently , I 'm a bad ass , " Mark answered .
tr	0	It was a teargas canister , pumping out a thick cloud of gas .
tr	4	In seconds , they were enveloped in a thick cloud of dense , white smoke .
tr	4	They had on helmets , gas masks and were dressed all in black .
tr	0	They approached the teargas cloud with taser pistols drawn and at the ready .
tr	1	Balancing Jimmy on his shoulder while adjusting a gas mask was surprisingly difficult .
tr	4	The taser cracked and popped as it broke into several plastic pieces .
tr	1	" I guess you aren 't so scary after all , " Josie said .
tr	2	" This doesn 't look goo - " Mark started to say .
tr	4	She wore a loose , white silk blouse and a long , black leather jacket .
tr	0	From under the car she stood on , a crack appeared in the asphalt .
tr	1	The molten , burning asphalt stuck to Mark , burning his skin .
tr	4	The past ten captures her name and reputation alone were enough to ensure surrender .
tr	0	" I 'm normally against hitting a woman , " Mark said .
tr	1	Behind him , in the truck , Josie winced at the terrific impact .
tr	0	" You can have this back when you start behaving better , " Mark said .
tr	0	" Lady , you are a royal pain in the ass , " Mark said .
tr	0	He held up his good hand , as if to shield himself .
tr	0	Mark grabbed a wrist and put a pair of handcuffs on her .
tr	2	Josie reached into the shopping bag and got out another polo shirt from the mall .
tr	0	Major Campbell had to move the phone away from his ear at this point .
tr	0	He had caught a lot of flack for that earlier as well .
tr	0	" Yes , I 'm aware of that , " Campbell said .
tr	3	What I want to know is why the military wants him so bad . "
tr	0	Jimmy turned his head and saw Mark sitting in the back seat .
tr	4	His skin was sunburned and he was even skinnier than he remembered .
tr	1	" I 'm not your girl , Jimmy , " Josie said .
tr	1	" Just relax , Jimmy , " she said , pulling him back .
tr	4	He again glanced into the rearview mirror as he talked to Jimmy and Josie .
tr	2	" He should be out of commission for a couple of days . "
tr	2	" Not unless you 've got a touch of clairvoyance yourself . "
tr	0	Jimmy didn 't know what clairvoyance was , but he relaxed a little .
tr	1	Contractors hired for their own paranormal abilities , coupled with human support agents .
tr	3	Across the street from the motel , a row of buildings sat dark .
tr	0	He wondered just what the Colonel really thought of him and this mission .
tr	1	His dreams were filled with nightmares about paying his mortgage and supporting his family .
tr	4	Along the way , his bare feet stepped on small bits of gravel .
tr	3	But then , he couldn 't exactly telepathically communicate with the Colonel .
tr	3	It took him at least three minutes , but he was finally off the lot .
tr	4	And only one Bowie knife each , hung on their chest harnesses .
tr	0	First , from his concealment behind a parked car , came Atlas .
tr	0	Like Atlas , Cronus and the whole squad appeared to be moving , bald statues .
tr	0	Her face was frozen in place with a mix of surprise and pain .
tr	4	As the gory redhead landed on his chest , he stepped back .
tr	3	The shapeshifter was faster , catching his wrist with its left hand .
tr	4	Heavy weapons designed for use mounted on vehicles had been an early choice .
tr	4	The barrels were shortened and the shoulder stock replaced with a pistol grip .
tr	4	Only his boots and the legs of his pants remained where he had been standing .
tr	1	He too began firing his machine gun , riddling the shapeshifter with rounds .
tr	3	Bullets that tore through his body , bursting organs and shattering bones .
tr	4	Beneath the shredded t-shirt , the new body was fresh and undamaged .
tr	0	" That 's for Atlas and Cronus , you scumbag , " he said .
tr	0	It had been designed as a last-ditch weapon , capable of stopping anything .
tr	4	They smashed into the asphalt , burying their ends three inches deep .
tr	3	One that he was pinpoint accurate with , at distances up to a hundred feet .
tr	1	With shaking hands , his vision starting to blur , he quickly reloaded .
tr	2	The round detonated , blowing a huge hole through both sides of the boat .
tr	4	He had a diner full of innocent civilians , and there were no more soldiers .
tr	3	Something was there , but Echo couldn 't quite latch on to it .
tr	3	But he was standing right next to the fallen soldier with the heart of stone .
tr	1	Echo didn 't flinch , he was too intent on making the psychic connection .
tr	2	Once more , the dragon spread its wings and took to the air .
tr	3	" Let 's get back to this dragon guy , " Jimmy said .
tr	2	" Sir , how do you plan on stopping the shapeshifter now ?
tr	3	The driver finally slowed the car to a stop and got out .
tr	0	He was now wearing white Chef 's pants and shirt , with white shoes .
tr	2	He quickly found what he was looking for - a security pass for the hotel .
tr	3	Jimmy finally came out of the bathroom and got back in the truck .
tr	4	He noticed Josie had moved to the front seat , beside Mark .
tr	2	" Now , you 're both clear on this , right ? "
tr	0	The shapeshifter was hard at work , slicing chicken for a particular dish .
tr	1	Josie was still in her short shorts , her t-shirt and sandals .
tr	0	The wall to their left was broken up by a small café and elevators .
tr	4	Josie wasted no time , and set off directly for the agents .
tr	0	" I 'm sorry , this elevator is not available , " Franks said .
tr	3	" That 's nothing to kid about , Miss , " Franks said at last .
tr	1	" She 's not kidding , she - " Jimmy started to say .
tr	4	Special Agent Franks reached out and pressed the call button for the elevator .
tr	0	" We 're going to go have a talk , kids , " Franks said .
tr	4	Josie began to edge toward the control panel while the shapeshifter was distracted .
tr	4	Having taken what he needed , the shapeshifter released Jimmy , who nearly fell over .
tr	4	His eyes burned and he had the worst possible headache he could ever imagine .
tr	4	The shapeshifter suddenly lunged at Josie , grabbing her with one hand around the throat .
tr	4	The blow staggered the shapeshifter , causing him to lose his grip on Josie .
tr	0	Jimmy hugged the leg as tight as he could , ducking his head .
tr	2	Behind Williams lay the suited bodies of two agents , in large pools of blood .
tr	2	She wore short shorts , showing off her long legs that were sprayed with blood .
tr	2	Josie fell onto the floor , coming out of her sandals as she did so .
tr	1	Agent Williams then transformed , into the older , thinning haired Asian Chef .
tr	0	Then he changed into a shorter , Hispanic woman with flowing hair and large breasts .
tr	1	" I was starting to like this shirt , " he said aloud .
tr	0	Josie began to walk slowly toward Mark , sideways , circling away from the shapeshifter .
tr	2	" Sorry , but you don 't look very scary to me . "
tr	2	" Oh , I 'm going to do this the old fashioned way .
tr	3	A fist that was filled with fresh , beating hearts three times a day .
tr	0	Others mocked him with sacrifices , of all things , human hearts .
tr	0	And the man had a strange , clear crystal over his face .
tr	4	The sidekick shattered ribs - driving some partially out the shapeshifter 's back .
tr	4	The blow lifted the shapeshifter off his feet and sent him flying into the pool .
tr	1	He spun in midair , his hips twisting around as his right leg swinging out .
tr	2	Organs ruptured in the giant 's torso from the power of the blows .
tr	1	Impossibly , the six-foot , four-inch human was stronger than he was .
tr	3	The two combatants twisted and turned in the water , straining against each other .
tr	4	He shook water from his wings and turned around to face the water .
tr	1	But to see such a thing in person ... she was simply stunned .
tr	0	He soared out of the pool , punching with his right fist .
tr	4	Several chairs and toppled umbrellas ignited as the stream of flames passed over them .
tr	2	He stepped up out of the pool , Josie moving out of his way .
tr	0	He would burn them both alive , then burn them to ash .
tr	3	Bullets began to tear into the giant 's neck , then his chin .
tr	1	Military helicopters had flown in , armed troops spilling out and forming a perimeter .
tr	0	There , two paramedics were waiting with a gurney that held a black body bag .
tr	4	Her face was red and tears were again streaming down her cheeks .
tr	0	It was some thousand feet away from the humans and all their activity .
tr	2	The coyote sniffed along the edge of the road , looking for food .
tr	3	The coyote leapt to its feet and spun around , biting at its own side .
tr	1	Wings sprouted from its back and its limbs thickened , sprouting grasping claws .
tr	0	He was now cleaned up , and wearing a camouflage Army uniform .
tr	4	They finally landed on the rooftop , where four more armed guards waited .
tr	4	As the elevator descended , Josie finally couldn 't keep her curiosity in check anymore .
tr	4	The last two guards wheeled Jimmy 's body out of the elevator and followed them .
tr	4	" Welcome back , Colonel , " a strange , computerized voice announced .
tr	2	" Colonel , I must object to - " the woman began to say .
tr	2	" You can object , or you can keep your job . "
tr	3	" The Pentagon hasn 't - " the doctor started to protest .
tr	2	They unzipped the body bag and pulled it down , exposing Jimmy 's body .
tr	4	The guards stepped back , turning and saluting the Colonel as they exited the chamber .
tr	3	The doctor and her assistant had lowered Jimmy 's body into the water .
tr	0	In a splash of water , Jimmy suddenly sat up , gasping for air .
tr	4	" I thought you were dead , " Josie said between kisses .
tr	1	Jimmy didn 't know which was better - being alive or Josie kissing him .
tr	2	Josie looked at Mark , holding the steel box in front of him .
tr	0	He held the box 's handle with his right hand , like a lantern .
tr	4	He reached his left hand up to the hinged face of the box .
tr	1	After midnight it 'll take away from Jimmy twice what it 's given him . "
tr	4	Josie looked at Jimmy then at her own hands , which remained normal .
tr	4	" Then we 'll see if Jimmy 's ready to enlist . "
tr	0	Victoria had a seven year old son , Toby , from a previous marriage .
tr	0	" Thank you , " said William , snapping out of his daydream .
tr	4	William and Ron were in different branches of the private research group .
tr	1	" That 's the problem with having a trophy girlfriend , " said William .
tr	1	William was tired and more than slightly suspicious of Dr. Smith 's intentions with Victoria .
tr	2	" Yes , it 's actually old technology now , " said Ron .
tr	4	" Tell me Ron , can you clone the accelerometer networked devices William is designing ?
tr	2	" Ron , I must apologize for Victoria , she 's so taken with technology .
tr	2	" Doctor Smith , I 'm so sorry for getting us off track . "
tr	3	" We really cannot interpret the data , only confirm that activity is occurring .
tr	4	Victoria sat on the edge of the bed , William standing by her side .
tr	2	" I 'm sorry Toby , we can 't go there now .
tr	0	William 's study was comfortable , with the feel of a private library .
tr	2	Your solution to this problem is brilliant and you solved it in 15 seconds .
tr	0	" Our aspirations and yours appear to be aligned , my dear .
tr	4	I 'm just concerned because he 's never had to deal with many emotions . "
tr	1	Looking at Ben , William raised his eyebrows , trying not to laugh .
tr	0	" I will have a second deliverable available to you , " said Alfred .
tr	3	" What can you tell me about the bomb at the Jakarta Marriott hotel ? "
tr	1	" And now you understand why I no longer have close friends , or family .
tr	2	You know of it , know it was Dr. Crawford , but you cannot help ?
tr	0	Perhaps you know a great deal about this issue , " said Alfred .
tr	2	It was far out of your control , on this you can trust .
tr	3	Two overhead spotlights illuminated their feast ; the rest of the apartment was dark .
tr	1	Victoria , I think you could have a story there , " said William .
tr	4	They watched the distant clouds together in silence while he finished his lunch .
tr	4	There 's something going on here they want me to determine on my own .
tr	3	" Thank you 007 , I 'll be at the host . "
tr	0	" Great , " said William , " that 's new . "
tr	1	Victoria was feeling increasing guilty over not sharing everything with William yet .
tr	0	Jacob said , " That session was better than I had hoped for .
tr	1	" That 's great , " said Victoria , her spirits sinking .
tr	3	We need to tightly control how this proceeds and tightly control how it ends . "
tr	4	" Do you how long he 's been involved with these terrorists ? "
tr	3	" Thank you for letting Toby and I stay with you , " said Victoria .
tr	4	The new memory is really giving him a new lease on life . "
tr	4	Victoria laid her head on William shoulder , relaxed and closed her eyes .
tr	3	Victoria sounded out the word slowly as if trying it for the first time .
tr	1	Victoria moved around the room , watching the display in Williams 's hand .
tr	0	It was early Saturday morning and William had already left for the lab .
tr	1	Toby fantasized about spending time with William every day , working on his HS projects .
tr	0	Victoria saw him flash past the kitchen , his feet pounding the hardwood floor .
tr	2	Simple childhood acts that most kids did a dozen times each day .
tr	1	He had lived a lavish lifestyle most of his life , it was a habit .
tr	0	At least Toby was starting to behave like a normal seven year old .
tr	3	It felt like flannel pajamas , only better ; a soft stretchy full-body fit .
tr	2	" There is no try , only do , " said 007 .
tr	1	How did they program this HS to be so effective in any given situation ?
tr	3	There was always more going on with the adults than they would tell him .
tr	2	" They told me you left and you couldn 't come back .
tr	2	" Let 's talk to him now , I know how to help . "
tr	3	Something is going on at NET that can hurt William and your mother . "
tr	4	When he looked back to Toby again his expression had clearly turned sad .
tr	3	" I need to talk to mother about this , " said Toby .
tr	3	I want you to tell your mother about me and everything I tell you .
tr	2	" Mother already know you have come back to help , " Toby said .
tr	3	" That 's an old login you used to get into NET .
tr	1	" They may not know I 'm using this login , " said Jacob .
tr	2	You can be their host , seeing more of what is going on around NET .
tr	0	Minutes passed , and Jacob waited in silence , staring at a blank screen .
tr	1	" I have started to discuss NET and our concerns , " said Jacob .
tr	0	" And I , " said Toby , " am a research project too .
tr	4	Victoria hugged Toby , and he relaxed , letting her squeeze him .
tr	2	" Toby , you are some 7 year old , " said Jacob .
tr	0	" 007 knows you are not brain damaged , " said Jacob .
tr	2	I think he could have a lot of fun with your average psychologist . "
tr	1	" I can say something he 'd recognize coming from me and not 007 .
tr	1	William laughed out loud again , tears coming to his eyes , his voice trembling .
tr	0	Dr. Jacob Crawford was killed , terminated , over a year ago .
tr	1	Toby was peering back at him , grinning and obviously proud of himself .
tr	1	" It seems you 're learning quickly , " William said hesitantly .
tr	2	" Yes , and you do it well , " said Alfred .
tr	1	I 'll sit on it until I hear back from you , " said Ron .
tr	2	His own network connections should be the only way to scan the room .
tr	1	" Toby , I ' m afraid it ' s bed time .
tr	1	" I 'm glad you came home , but I am tired .
tr	1	" It 's good to see you , my friend , " said William .
tr	3	I intended to follow through and I think he understood that . "
tr	1	I 'll fix us a drink , " William said , leaving the study .
tr	2	" You should buy better alcohol for your friends , " said William .
tr	3	" We just covered up the fact that I didn 't die .
tr	0	Jacob took another drink and continued , " Alfred made all the arrangements .
tr	2	Jacob drained his glass quickly and rose to pour them both another .
tr	0	" We didn 't speak , just sat , for an hour maybe .
tr	2	It was empty and looked dusty through the windows -- probably unoccupied for months . "
tr	0	For all we know , they may have planned a separate trap for her .
tr	0	" Later that day , Alfred called the Jakarta office several times .
tr	0	He was worried I had shared everything -- that I had told her too much .
tr	1	Alfred is an influential person , with many business contacts going back years .
tr	1	" Victoria , " William said , " is not Toby ' s mother .
tr	0	" Victoria and I saw this as a way to right Alfred 's wrong .
tr	0	I believe through training they taught him how to use his long-term photographic memory . "
tr	1	" Your relationship with Victoria is not part of her deal with Alfred .
tr	3	CHAPTER SIXTEEN " Toby can connect to the network in my lab ? "
tr	1	You won 't be disappointed , " whispered Victoria , grasping William 's arm .
tr	0	Jacob was dividing scrambled eggs , bacon and toast among three plates .
tr	4	I was paranoid for weeks , thinking he would detect me on the network .
tr	0	" Playing dead all these months , you are a hack , " said William .
tr	1	" You took me by surprise , " said William , his heart pounding .
tr	1	The women love me in this suit and I 'm milking it .
tr	0	William laughed , 007 was truly a work of art and science .
tr	0	" You really should pause to breath when you speak , " said William .
tr	2	And yes , I suppose you both still have a lot to learn . "
tr	0	" He was once a great man , Toby , " said Jacob .
tr	1	" I 'm a little unnerved when I 'm around 007 , " said Victoria .
tr	2	" I 'm going to take over control of 007 and meet William outside . "
tr	2	" Toby , can you show us what you 're seeing ? "
tr	1	" That 's right , if I let you , which I will .
tr	1	" When are we going out for a drink , Jenny ? "
tr	0	Will you do me a favor and stay by my desk until I 'm back ?
tr	1	Be right back ... " Jenny ran down the hall and turned the corner .
tr	2	" Indeed , " said 007 , standing tall and smiling broadly .
tr	4	Please let me know how I can help , " said 007 .
tr	0	" I have a message from a friend , " said 007 .
tr	1	" That , " said Ben , " sounds like Toby Cunningham .
tr	1	It was his idea for me to visit you , " said 007 .
tr	2	" William would like Toby 's ability to be our little secret for now .
tr	1	" He 's fine , " William and Victoria both said at the same time .
tr	1	I 'll let Toby explain , " said William , pointing to the display .
tr	0	Normal memory , not used , fades away , " said Ben .
tr	3	" I 'm not so sure about that either , " said Toby .
tr	3	But the process taught me the function of the HS units . "
tr	1	" Are you saying you can execute our programs in your brain ? "
tr	1	" It was rocky from the beginning , connecting in fits and starts .
tr	3	" I think it 's a huge win that he connected at all .
tr	1	Basically I 'll rip their group in two if we 're damaged in any way .
tr	3	The important thing is that you 're using the implant and improving every day . "
tr	3	" Yes , I 'm trying to connect to it and learn the protocols . "
tr	3	That suit produces the same outputs as the HS unit 's , right ? "
tr	1	said Victoria , raising her voice and leaning over Toby 's shoulder .
tr	1	I suppose I understand him feeling guilty , with the uncertainty and all .
tr	1	" I think it 's a good idea , Ben , " said William .
tr	4	Now , my worst fears about these surgeries seem to be true . "
tr	2	We really don 't know what or who we 're dealing with . "
tr	2	" Oh , yes , I do that ... for movies and TV .
tr	2	I 'd like to apply some things to your face , too .
tr	1	" She is the definition of bizarre , " said Toby , making Victoria laugh .
tr	0	" The guys are gone all day , no explanations , then ... that .
tr	3	" Don 't worry big boy , that 's not the plan . "
tr	2	It should only take an hour or so with the wire . "
tr	1	He 'll basically just sit in the chair like this and behave himself . "
tr	3	They had cleaned the apartment , and the room felt foreign without the normal clutter .
tr	1	Victoria had left him alone , intending to watch from her display in the kitchen .
tr	1	It was incredible how much work the implant did on its own .
tr	3	I thought it might come in handy during the duration of a reboot .
tr	4	William rotated the video feed and focused on the text as Alfred sent his message .
tr	1	" I 'm back , " 007 declared , jogging up to William 's desk .
tr	3	" The buffoon is sitting at the top of the stairs staring into space . "
tr	3	The outfit was complete with a black jacket , bow tie and shiny black shoes .
tr	1	" I had him lowered by two inches , " replied William .
tr	2	" Well , that should do , " said Jacob , entering the room .
tr	1	Playing " host " to these visitors was enough stress to kill a horse .
tr	2	Alfred started to walk , pulling her arm to follow the group .
tr	0	" No , " said Ben , " Ahmad looks familiar to me .
tr	0	The two goons are heading back to the car , " said William .
tr	2	" I suppose we could lock them out and call the cavalry . "
tr	1	" We 're not safe in this building , " said William .
tr	2	" Don 't be a fool , they 'll take you too . "
tr	2	" Then have him walk quickly out the front door , looking around , panicky .
tr	4	CHAPTER THIRTY The elevator bell sounded and the door opened on the lower level .
tr	4	" Please excuse me , I need to check my messages . "
tr	1	" It 's okay , make him jump inside , " Jacob said .
tr	3	You must trust that I have your best interests at heart . "
tr	3	" He told him to take Toby back to the airport , " said Toby .
tr	2	" Cooperate , " said Jacob , " go along with him .
tr	0	Alfred had a bout of nausea that nearly made his knees buckle .
tr	2	" Look , " she called out , pointing to her display .
tr	0	" He 's attaching a silencer to a pistol , " said Ben .
tr	0	Mohammed was back in the hall again when Alfred 's elevator arrived .
tr	3	After a long moment , the two walked to Alfred 's office without comment .
tr	3	But Dr. Crawford had to be eliminated , thanks to you . "
tr	3	Mohammed pulled the pistol out and pointed it at Alfred 's chest .
tr	2	Alfred slumped forward in slow motion , his head coming to rest on the desk .
tr	3	" Toby , stop the security system from reporting this alert , " said Jacob .
tr	2	" Right , " said Ben , rushing out of the room .
tr	1	Alfred cannot be in better hands than Dr. Ben 's right now .
tr	0	Take that pistol back to William 's lab and hide it someplace safe . "
tr	4	" Of course , they 're right where the chauffeur left them . "
tr	4	" Of course , but I don 't need the keys to operate the limousine .
tr	4	They just never let me take her out for a spin . "
tr	1	" You can 't scan this and determine what 's inside can you ?
tr	1	I 'm blocking the security system from tracing our exit from the building .
tr	1	But you realize this is a completely unsanctioned activity , " said 007 .
tr	1	" Like most of NET assets , this is no ordinary limo .
tr	3	You should be able to get this NET asset through the security .
tr	4	" Now what are these red , yellow and green lights at the intersections ? "
tr	1	I have a fix on 006 's position , and you 're right .
tr	1	" It was my business , and my responsibility to know , " said Jacob .
tr	0	She was thinking of the bomb in Jakarta , and of Toby .
tr	1	" 006 is right inside that hanger , third window down . "
tr	3	The room was still empty , the quiet music the only sound .
tr	3	There was nothing to do now but wait and worry about them getting back .
tr	2	Our lobby is armored , walled off from the rest of the facility . "
tr	3	" Do you have a better idea of what to do with it ? "
tr	4	Victoria and Jacob entered the lower level , looking for the two Asians .
tr	2	She mirrored Jacob 's composure , willing her emotions to not betray her .
tr	4	" You so helpfully chose to meet your father at the hotel .
tr	2	Ahmad sighed , folded his hands , and looked at them pensively .
tr	0	" Please , Miss Crawford , I am not an amateur . "
tr	4	An emergency light around the corner came on , but did not illuminate their room .
tr	2	Suddenly the stairwell door burst open , and 007 ran into the room .
tr	3	At that instant , Toby restored the electric power to the building .
tr	0	The parking lot was a crater with several cars randomly strewn about .
tr	1	007 followed them , leading Prasad by a plastic tie binding his wrists .
tr	0	007 and Jacob locked Prasad in the security scanner hall with Ahmad .
tr	1	Toby convinced me it was our best alternative , " said William .
tr	1	" We have so much explaining to do , " said Victoria .
tr	4	We 're not dealing with the best and brightest , here . "
tr	2	Someone far away , probably another country , was monitoring the unit .
tr	4	Other than ourselves , there was no one within a two-mile radius of the bomb .
tr	2	Toby was misty-eyed , with one arm around Jacob , the other around Victoria .
tr	2	This ebook may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	2	I just don 't want to be bored out of my mind , okay ?
tr	1	" Let 's find some authentic Irish food , " he said with a smile .
tr	2	The door swung open and an icy blast of air invaded the room .
tr	1	The road divided undulating hocks and hills crisscrossed by ancient stone walls .
tr	3	" Just trying to adjust to island time , you know . "
tr	3	" Or at least pack them away until it 's time to go home . "
tr	1	" Let 's look in the house first , son , " he said .
tr	2	Next to it was a door , which Sarah hoped was to an indoor bathroom .
tr	2	The floor was polished wood and several thick rugs covered most of it .
tr	4	He kissed her then called to John : " Come on , John .
tr	2	" John , " David moaned from his side of the big bed .
tr	0	" My God , what is -- " Sarah covered her mouth with her hands .
tr	0	" It 's a world catastrophe , Sarah , " he said .
tr	0	Sarah stared at the car as if she were in a trance .
tr	0	" John , please stop asking me that , " Sarah said .
tr	4	" It 's been too long since I rode , " she said .
tr	3	The telly went out about two hours ago with the rest of the power . "
tr	3	" My Michael is hard to locate at the best of times .
tr	1	" They 'll be living in London , won 't they ? "
tr	4	Don 't tell me the poor things haven 't eaten since you 've arrived ? "
tr	4	" And I see you still have matches and a jug of kerosene . "
tr	3	She took a leather halter off the hook in front of the first stall .
tr	0	The name " Dan " was on a tarnished metal plaque on the door .
tr	0	" Just gon na arrange breakfast and do a linen change , big guy . "
tr	4	She clipped the lead to the halter and led the horse out of the stall .
tr	3	" Don 't you think we should try to get to Limerick ?
tr	1	" I don 't think staying here is a good idea , " she said .
tr	4	He had started to stamp his feet and that made her more nervous .
tr	1	" Even if the cities aren 't radioactive , it 's still a bad idea .
tr	2	" Should we ... should we stay away from town , do you think ?
tr	1	" I don 't know , " Mat said , picking up the pitchfork again .
tr	0	Sarah hadn 't noticed John enter the barn and wondered how much he had heard .
tr	4	An hour later , all the horses had been fed and their stalls cleaned .
tr	0	Sarah came up behind him , and wiped her hands on a towel .
tr	2	" God knows , you 'll have time to do it , too . "
tr	0	" We 've got salt and water and bags of flour in the cellar .
tr	3	" Let 's just take this one step at a time . "
tr	1	" Trust me , sweetie , " Sarah said as she kissed him .
tr	1	" Don 't worry , " John said , pulling on his jeans .
tr	3	" I want the little brown one , " John said to his Dad .
tr	2	" So I 'll call him Star , " he said happily .
tr	3	" Right , " David said , settling on the bed with them .
tr	4	The two horses and one pony were tacked up and stood quietly .
tr	2	Just walk around the paddock and get used to him , " she said .
tr	1	" Kind of , " he said , lacing his fingers to boost her up .
tr	0	" David , I 'm not sure about this , " Sarah said .
tr	3	" Why don 't we take some time to get comfortable with the horses first ?
tr	1	" Let 's don 't rush it , darling , " she said .
tr	1	" I don 't know , " David said , clicking to his horse .
tr	1	His hands rested on his knees as he stared out across the scrubby Irish landscape .
tr	1	A world that was uninterested in rules or laws or should or musts .
tr	4	When John trotted up beside her she realized she had been holding her breath .
tr	1	Is it just Americans who think in terms of ownership when they like something ?
tr	0	" I think there 's a farm up ahead , " he said .
tr	4	" If there 's anyone home , we can find out about our caretakers . "
tr	0	" I 'm so glad to meet you , " Sarah said .
tr	4	" We were afraid you wouldn 't be able to get out and about .
tr	0	" You 'll take it one day at a time and you 'll learn . "
tr	1	And with Himself tracking in every manner of dirt all day long .
tr	0	" Mom , you can 't understand a word he says . "
tr	0	David sat down next to Sarah and gave her arm a squeeze .
tr	4	The men around the campfire were unshaven and their clothes virtually rags .
tr	0	He put his hand on the shoulder of the man now holding the dead dog .
tr	4	David stashed them in his saddlebags as if they were the finest caviar .
tr	0	Sarah caught her breath and pulled him away from the front steps .
tr	2	" The food they took was food stolen out of your son 's mouth . "
tr	1	" They didn 't find the wine , " David said with a smile .
tr	3	John took his plate of eggs and sat down at the kitchen table .
tr	1	" I 'll bring back milk and eggs , " he promised .
tr	2	On the very bottom shelf of the bookcase , she found it .
tr	1	Finding it felt like the first real stroke of luck since the crisis .
tr	3	" Do you know for a fact that the pasture is fenced ? "
tr	2	" Look , I know -- " " No , you don 't know !
tr	3	She turned to walk back to the house , praying that John was there .
tr	2	Sarah looked closer and could see John 's red shirt in front of the flock .
tr	0	Sarah shifted both lead ropes to one hand and hugged him tightly .
tr	0	The fear and anxiety of the last hour would take awhile to abate .
tr	3	The next morning , Sarah noticed that John was very quiet at breakfast .
tr	2	John pushed his eggs around with his fork and did not look up .
tr	1	" It 's ' cause the sheep trust us , " John was saying .
tr	3	" They just know that we know what 's best for them . "
tr	4	" I don 't know the real name of it , " he said .
tr	3	" It 's big and blue so that 's what I call it .
tr	3	That 's the point I was trying to make , " he said .
tr	0	David sat back in his chair and picked up the hatchet he was sharpening .
tr	2	John dumped the bridle he was working on to the floor next to him .
tr	2	A fat lot of good they did him , lying in his own gore . "
tr	0	That night , Sarah and John sat in front of the fireplace as usual .
tr	4	" Feels weird , Dad not being here , " John said .
tr	2	" Dad said not to tell you , " John said , frowning at her .
tr	1	" He said you 'd freak out about a gun in the house . "
tr	3	CHAPTER EIGHT The next morning , they woke up to frost on the ground .
tr	4	John 's jacket was so big , he folded the sleeves back .
tr	4	What if they were here long enough for him to grow into them ?
tr	4	She fetched the rifle from the kitchen and the box of rounds .
tr	2	" Dear God in Heaven , how do you know that ? "
tr	1	" I saw it on YouTube , " he said , shrugging .
tr	1	" Just two shots apiece to save ammunition , " she said .
tr	2	( Which , of course , works out okay these days . )
tr	3	The mornings are crystal blue and so bright at first that it hurts your eyes .
tr	4	Every once in awhile he got up and added a stick to the fire .
tr	2	She folded the letter and tucked it inside her Joy of Cooking cookbook .
tr	3	David took a hot muffin and sat down at the kitchen table .
tr	1	" I had no idea it would snow this early in Ireland . "
tr	4	" I don 't like the feeling of being out here by ourselves . "
tr	1	" I 'm tacking up Star , " he said , shrugging into his jacket .
tr	1	Give it to God Give it to God Give it ... She looked at David .
tr	4	It made her feel more confident the more she was around them .
tr	2	David stood in the door , cradling his hand to his chest .
tr	0	" I thought you were going with him to check on the sheep . "
tr	0	" This is not a safe place to be wandering about anymore , David .
tr	3	Sarah tried to fight down the surge of fear that began to radiate from her .
tr	0	Sarah handed him the rifle and a small bag of cold biscuits with goat butter .
tr	2	" So you 're going to be doing this from now on ?
tr	2	" Look , Sarah , I don 't know what their value is to us .
tr	3	That first night , he loosened Rocky 's girth and tethered him to a bush .
tr	2	The sheep had found a natural stone windbreak and had bedded down nearby .
tr	3	No matter what life threw at them , she dealt with it .
tr	0	He had to admit there was a lot to be afraid of nowadays .
tr	1	David woke to the sight of his son walking toward him and leading his pony .
tr	2	" I don 't suppose you brought a thermos of coffee ? "
tr	3	" I don 't think predators will attack in the daylight , " he said .
tr	2	" Something comes , throw rocks at it or come get me . "
tr	2	" We don 't know how long he 'll be gone . "
tr	1	She listened intently for any sound of her boy and his flock .
tr	0	The world around her was beautiful and she was an integral part of it .
tr	2	Unless you 're cold and want to -- " " I 'm good . "
tr	0	" And don 't come back with him , " she told him .
tr	3	" Put him to bed for the night , will you , sport ?
tr	4	She gathered up the dogs in her arms and spoke to John .
tr	0	" You turned a bad day into a sort of miracle . "
tr	0	I cannot tell you what a day I have ahead of me today !
tr	2	Sometimes people actually showed up in their frontcourt asking for food or news .
tr	3	With effort , it could be moved with both of them dragging it .
tr	4	She milked the little goat daily and made bread dough every other day .
tr	4	He pulled off two pieces of biscuit and fed them to his dogs .
tr	3	' Coz that 's what I call giving to the bitter end . "
tr	0	Sarah wagged a warning spatula at him that just made them both laugh harder .
tr	2	The old man looked at him blankly over his morning cup of tea .
tr	0	Was all this just another case of him not being able to say no ?
tr	3	It suddenly occurred to him that the two farms would do better to consolidate .
tr	4	Then , Ethel acted like she had prior Intel about the afternoon 's planned activities .
tr	4	From the minute Sarah came into the coop , the chicken ran from her .
tr	0	The bag twitched and convulsed maniacally at the end of her arm .
tr	0	David shook his head and looked at Seamus who stared peacefully out across the pasture .
tr	4	The dog , if he had barked , would not have awakened him .
tr	3	He gave a thumbs up to indicate he understood and turned back to his training .
tr	0	The plucking and gutting had been nearly as traumatic as the killing .
tr	3	But the thrill of her accomplishment blotted out the pain and horror of the day .
tr	2	" Do you think something happened to him on the road ? "
tr	2	He walked to the front door and looked out at the road .
tr	2	" John , did you do last check on the animals ? "
tr	3	And then , things got so busy , she actually forgot to take them .
tr	4	One boy , her own child , stood between them and the barn .
tr	2	" I got one for each of you now , " she said .
tr	0	The man with his arms upraised looked from Sarah to the man who was bleeding .
tr	4	" I 'm protecting my family , " Sarah said , feeling stronger every second .
tr	0	" I 'll need you to stand away from the barn a bit .
tr	4	On the road , he had seen two men stumbling in the dark .
tr	3	" I just knew that at that range I couldn 't miss . "
tr	3	" I didn 't have time to worry about that , " she said .
tr	0	He put his hand out to her from where he lay on the cot .
tr	3	" And they 're worried but it 's hard for them to get out .
tr	2	He had awoken hours earlier to drag the body out of sight .
tr	4	" We need news of what 's going on , " he said .
tr	0	" Look , David , I killed a man last night , okay ?
tr	2	" I wish I could protect you from all of this . "
tr	0	He grabbed David 's fork and began to eat his second breakfast of the day .
tr	3	She fully intended to trot Dan most of the way home to cut her time .
tr	4	She realized that the decision to go , herself , was a good one .
tr	0	Had his mother loved and cherished him just as she did John ?
tr	0	If this crisis hadn 't happened , would she have known him ?
tr	3	The brutal fact that she had extinguished him came upon her in moments without warning .
tr	2	If you do it out of instinct , are you any less culpable ?
tr	0	People parted as Siobhan made her way forward toward Mike 's wagon .
tr	4	Are you really going to multiply your fishes to feed the masses ?
tr	1	" It is if there 's nothing here , " Siobhan said .
tr	4	It was the reason she had begun riding in the first place .
tr	4	Before long she was running tapes in her head that she found difficult to stop .
tr	0	Sarah tightened her calves against Dan 's sides and he moved amiably forward .
tr	3	Do not let an international disaster stand in the way of what 's important .
tr	3	The mug of tea she held turned the moist dirt to a film .
tr	4	Her eyes flickered , for the millionth time , to where Dan was tied .
tr	1	" If your husband could see his way , " she said .
tr	0	Like a little machine gun , she had thought when she bought the gun .
tr	1	" Oh , bless you , missus , " the woman said .
tr	2	" You said you 'd trade one of your milk cows ? "
tr	2	" Noon tomorrow , " she said , patting Julie 's hand .
tr	1	Making up her mind , she turned to Dan and swung up into the saddle .
tr	0	" Good day , missus , " he said , moving away from Dan .
tr	1	" I 'm Mike Donovan and this here 's me son , Gavin .
tr	0	" And we can trade its parts for food and supplies . "
tr	0	Gavin looked at Sarah with surprise and then turned to his Dad .
tr	4	Once in the saddle , she could see the men were patiently waiting for her .
tr	2	" Sure it doesn 't look like foul play , just bad luck .
tr	0	" No , there 's a husband and a kid , too .
tr	2	" Go on , Gavin , he won 't bite you . "
tr	4	Dear Mom and Dad , I cannot even tell you how cold it is here !
tr	3	The rain was tattooing out a gentle beat against the kitchen windows .
tr	2	" You said probably this afternoon , " John said from the bed .
tr	1	Even you did it in the pouring rain and it was no big deal . "
tr	0	Sarah sat down next to him and put her arms around him .
tr	0	" I am praying all the time that Dad comes back . "
tr	1	" I 'm fine , " she said , patting his hand .
tr	0	They walked at a steady , slow plod for nearly an hour .
tr	3	The air was icy cold but she didn 't bother putting her shoes on .
tr	2	" Someone will be up soon and they 'll do it . "
tr	1	John was kneeling down next to her , his hand holding his pony 's reins .
tr	3	" Or maybe it 's just the storm making it feel like night . "
tr	4	she wondered , trying to wipe her face with her jacket sleeve .
tr	4	She underestimated how hurt she was and they had to stop frequently .
tr	2	" A kind of broken down cottage or something across the pasture a ways .
tr	0	Maybe it 's just bad luck and it doesn 't mean anything at all . "
tr	0	" We 'll try again to find Dad as soon as Dan is better ? "
tr	0	We 'll try again as soon as Dan can walk again without limping .
tr	0	I don 't really know what happened to him but John thinks he fell .
tr	1	I cannot go alone on John 's pony and leave John here by himself .
tr	1	I hated missing Thanksgiving this year and now not being with you for Christmas .
tr	2	We 'll make it up in all the wonderful holidays to come .
tr	0	To mark the special day , Sarah had allowed a fire in the hearth .
tr	1	I didn 't think it was an ' either or . " '
tr	2	The woman , Betta , told him daily that no one was looking for him .
tr	3	That they could hold out in the midst of Mad Max 2012 and survive ?
tr	1	She was waiting for him in front of where Siobhan 's Dairy used to be .
tr	2	The woman laughed good-naturedly but David noticed that Julie did not join in .
tr	2	" You 'll not be blaming Julie for our little ruse , eh ?
tr	4	" But me mam needed help , same as you thought I did .
tr	3	Except for the part about being lied to , David thought with growing anger .
tr	3	It didn 't matter how many times he 'd told her what his name was .
tr	4	The stronger he got , the more anxious Betta seemed to become .
tr	3	Didn 't he think she wanted to free him to do it ?
tr	0	It truly was a feast , as John kept saying all night .
tr	2	It was cold but it didn 't look like more snow on the way .
tr	3	But snow or not , she would need to leave their snug little cottage today .
tr	0	Sarah poured the tea and mixed milk and sugar into two mugs .
tr	0	" Seamus was the handsomest lad in the village , many years ago .
tr	2	" If you could 've known him , " she said to Sarah .
tr	0	To end up ... to end up ... " Sarah touched her hand again .
tr	4	He couldn 't remember the last time she had brought food to him .
tr	1	" Margie and Jamie , I told you , " she said with impatience .
tr	4	From the haze of hunger and blighted memory , he could see her insanity .
tr	1	He spoke again before exhaustion and sickness carried him back to unconsciousness .
tr	0	Sarah cleaned Dan 's feet and ran her hands down all four of his legs .
tr	2	The agony of not knowing coiled in her stomach like a black knot .
tr	0	Sarah laced her fingers in Dan 's mane and held him tightly .
tr	4	But as the voices got louder , he found himself being jolted awake .
tr	2	David jerked up and rasped out the single word " No ! "
tr	0	Seamus was the same way and I 'll bet your David is , too . "
tr	3	" Back home , that 's exactly what I attempted to do .
tr	0	" That would be because you 're American , and all , " she said .
tr	4	" Look , sweetie , I have no control over the weather . "
tr	2	" I saw the wisdom in you not going , Mom , " he muttered .
tr	4	The big gypsy stood at the end of the bed eying David .
tr	0	" Don 't bother him with this shite , " he said .
tr	2	" What do you want we should do with the body ? "
tr	3	The bullet was still in there but it didn 't worry him .
tr	0	" You 're American , " he said again , studying her face .
tr	3	Lunch is on the table only it 's not this table . "
tr	0	The results of the gunshot , she thought , her stomach roiling .
tr	3	They had thrown most of the cart contents she had packed into the dirt .
tr	4	He was large and pale , as if he had never seen the sun .
tr	1	" I know , I know , " Sarah said , trying to whisper .
tr	4	" There 's something else , then , isn 't there , Sarah ? "
tr	4	Before she left , she hugged her son tightly and whispered into his ear .
tr	3	" Da , sure isn 't that the American lady coming in to town ? "
tr	1	He saw Sarah riding down the street on a large thoroughbred cross .
tr	2	Most sane people would not choose to be out in this weather , he thought .
tr	3	The town was more alive today than it had a right to be .
tr	4	The foreign looking ones were quieter than the gypsies , he noted .
tr	4	He dropped to his knees and vomited down the front of himself .
tr	0	Was she really looking at this rabble as a source of credible information ?
tr	1	He fell down to shrieks of laughter and rowdy insults from his friends .
tr	2	Donovan had just enough tea left in his thermos for one last cup .
tr	0	" I thought they might have information about my husband , " she said .
tr	3	But since the blackout , he 's taken advantage of the situation .
tr	2	And he 's found a following of scum just like him . "
tr	2	" One of ' em said this guy Finn was looking for me .
tr	0	" I 'll be asking you to take a breath and think for a moment .
tr	0	" Uncle Aidan won 't leave without Aunt Mary and the girls . "
tr	2	" Probably not , so I 'll be bringing them , too .
tr	0	" He shot them , " she said , dropping the curtain .
tr	3	Her focused , maniacal determination worked to blot out the other thing .
tr	3	There was nothing they could do for the cottage but let it burn .
tr	4	She leaned over the side of the wagon and threw up into the bushes .
tr	2	Sarah shifted in her position in the wagon to look back at the house .
tr	0	He had one of the puppies with him but couldn 't find the other .
tr	3	Donovan held out the cup to her and she drank from it without thinking .
tr	0	Her hair was gathered back in a single braid down her back .
tr	2	" We 've heard a good bit about you from Siobhan and the others .
tr	3	" Can you not let the woman have two mouthfuls before agitating her ? "
tr	1	" I mean , I assume you will be coming with us ?
tr	2	There 's a place for you and the boy if you want to come . "
tr	1	Sarah was astonished and delighted to feel his hand slip into hers .
tr	0	He took a deep breath , glanced once at Sarah , and began .
tr	1	" Is it true the cities are radioactive like they said at first ? "
tr	1	" If what Craig said is correct , the American south is fine . "
tr	1	" Your country is helping its friend England first , " he said .
tr	2	" We are on our own and likely to be for years to come . "
tr	1	John was trying to make his dog , Patrick , remain in the stay position .
tr	0	His mother sat watching him , a cup of steaming black tea in her hands .
tr	3	" Why didn 't you say something last night at the campfire ? "
tr	2	" No , of course not , John , " she said .
tr	2	" We 'll continue to look for him but ... " How to say this ?
tr	3	It was true what they said about the resiliency of children , Sarah thought .
tr	2	I mean , it would be good for all of us , Fiona .
tr	2	You can 't start a new community looking over your shoulder . "
tr	3	" And then , afterward , you intend to come with us ? "
tr	1	" Now that we 're sisters , can I ask you a question ? "
tr	4	" Having a moment to myself before all hell breaks loose . "
tr	3	" I can 't live with the threat of them surprising us .
tr	1	" That 's asinine , " he said , his eyes locking onto hers .
tr	2	I keep getting them confused and obviously you do , too . "
tr	3	" And it 's not the same thing , " he said .
tr	4	And then , without warning , he leaned over and kissed her on the mouth .
tr	3	It 's okay , it 's just ... " " No need to explain .
tr	3	Finn strode down the barn , glancing with satisfaction at the half-full stalls .
tr	4	The family had taken their horses but had left behind full bales of stacked hay .
tr	1	The way Finn saw things , Brendan should be plenty worried about him .
tr	2	" So , just in Ireland on holiday , are you ? "
tr	1	In many ways , he didn 't look any different from his men .
tr	0	He watched him as he rubbed his shoulder like it still hurt him .
tr	4	" He knows she 's yer wife , mate , " Brendan insisted .
tr	2	Donovan sat down next to her on a log rolled up to the campfire .
tr	2	" No , no , " he said , looking at her now .
tr	4	I mean , unless you think you can live with them somehow . "
tr	0	Sarah heard first and then saw John across the campfire laughing at something Gavin said .
tr	1	I 've seen Fiona in action so I wouldn 't buy it . "
tr	3	He 's one of ' em 's that 's on watch tonight .
tr	0	" I don 't know what you mean , " Sarah said .
tr	3	" So when we retreat we don 't get all shot to shit . "
tr	0	" That doesn 't sound like a great plan , " Sarah said , frowning .
tr	0	" The Irish aren 't afraid of a little bad weather , " Sarah said .
tr	0	" Right , " she said , patting him on the shoulder .
tr	3	It also seemed to him that his bad arm hadn 't hurt last night .
tr	2	He stood up and looked out the window at the grey misting Irish morning .
tr	2	David ate the moldy soda bread and washed it down with strong , tepid tea .
tr	3	He felt lucky there was anything to eat this morning at all .
tr	1	Even Finn , usually an early riser , hadn 't shown himself yet this morning .
tr	0	The woman stood with her hands on her hips staring directly at Sarah .
tr	2	She looked at Donovan who was still watching the storm clouds move in .
tr	4	Were they really risking their lives just because Donovan asked them to ?
tr	3	I can 't think about any of this right now , she thought .
tr	4	She had hugged him fiercely not five minutes before she mounted up .
tr	3	David stared at the rope winding tighter and tighter around his wrists .
tr	2	" He threw a bucket of piss on you , you said . "
tr	0	Sarah had to admit the tea tasted good against the bad day .
tr	3	" It 's all going to work out , sweetheart , " she said .
tr	0	Sarah let John go and looked up at Gavin standing before her .
tr	1	Donovan was lying in one of the empty stalls , hay piled around him .
tr	0	" He 's not happy , you 'll be knowing that straightaway , aye ? "
tr	2	" I don 't show myself ... so , how do I. . ? "
tr	2	" Would he do this for you , do you think ? "
tr	0	Sarah visibly shook herself and the image of shooting children from her head .
tr	0	" I find Finn , " Sarah said , her stare as hard as diamonds .
tr	2	His men stood flanking the main road for nearly two hours now .
tr	1	Finn 's anxiety began to throb in his chest like a panicked bird .
tr	2	He needed her bloody husband for his plan for torturing the bitch to work .
tr	3	It hadn 't taken much to make the promises that bought his freedom .
tr	0	When Dan reared , Sarah didn 't have time to lean forward .
tr	4	Sarah tried to wrench free from the two men who held her .
tr	1	Brendan rubbed his hands along his jeans and refused to look at Finn .
tr	1	Finn glanced around the nearly deserted camp , his frustration coming off him in waves .
tr	1	" I tell ya , I couldn 't find ' im . "
tr	2	Brendan looked up long enough to look toward the road that Finn indicated .
tr	3	At the gesture , Brendan took two steps back and put his hands up .
tr	1	David knelt by Gavin 's still form and unbuckled the gun and its holster .
tr	3	The boy was still breathing but there was nothing David could do for him .
tr	2	" I 'm sorry , son , " he said to the unconscious boy .
tr	0	The men laughed and it was all Sarah could do not to throw up again .
tr	2	Two of his men dragged John off his pony and over to Finn .
tr	2	" I 've got your handsome husband , too , you know . "
tr	2	The cord 's too big so he couldn 't make a good knot . "
tr	2	" No , you told me I 'm not allowed to have a gun . "
tr	0	" Hide it , " Sarah whispered , pulling her hands back .
tr	2	" Out the window and fast before they come back to check on you . "
tr	0	Sarah nodded , her heart so full she nearly sat back down again .
tr	1	" Now this is interesting , " Finn said , looking at the knife .
tr	2	I left him out there so you could see what you did to him . "
tr	0	Sarah looked at the gypsy and willed herself not to glance at John or David .
tr	4	We were hungry , we came upon your place and begged for food . "
tr	0	" If the brat moves , shoot him , " he said over his shoulder .
tr	1	" Bet you live in a big mansion back in America , huh ? "
tr	3	She turned her attention to the gypsy holding David and pointed the gun at him .
tr	2	David , you look like you 're going to pass out ? "
tr	0	" I don 't care what your name is , " Sarah said .
tr	2	" You are going to tell them -- " " Mom , look out !
tr	0	She touched the blood soaked pad he was holding to his chest .
tr	2	" Oy , John , Donovan says to tell your mum not to shoot him .
tr	2	" One way or the other , " John had added ominously .
tr	0	John came around the corner of the house with his dog Patrick at his heels .
tr	0	How soon we take each other for granted , Sarah thought with a smile .
tr	0	" Yeah , yeah , " John said , turning toward the barn .
tr	0	David had been leaning back in his chair but sat up abruptly .
tr	1	Mike sighed and took a long sip from his glass of whiskey .
tr	3	" The general feeling is that it 's just a matter of time now .
tr	4	" So , " he said , " we 're going home . "
tr	4	It had been six months since they had gotten news that rescue might be imminent .
tr	0	He was all man , in spite of his bearing and his garments .
tr	0	He glanced northward , in the direction from which he had come .
tr	3	And in the midst of that plain rose the walls and towers of a city .
tr	0	His flight had been blind , into a country of which he was wholly ignorant .
tr	4	" If I 'd been there , I 'd have knifed her myself .
tr	0	She wasn 't far behind you when I caught up with her .
tr	4	Only the sister of the woman you killed happened to strike your trail . "
tr	3	" I 've been this far south , but not this far east .
tr	0	The giant trunks of trees less than a hundred yards away looked dim and ghostly .
tr	0	A long spiked tail , like that of a gargantuan scorpion , trailed out behind .
tr	4	If so , it won 't leave here until we 're both dead . "
tr	4	" She must leave to eat and drink , " he said helplessly .
tr	1	She could endure a situation like this with a coolness impossible to a civilized person .
tr	3	" Well , the folk of the city can 't help us just now .
tr	3	" What a blasted fool I am not to have thought of that before !
tr	3	" What the devil has that got to do with those sticks ? "
tr	1	" There 's more than one way of skinning a panther . "
tr	4	Some five feet below him the mighty head crashed terribly but futilely through the leaves .
tr	0	She clutched at a rocky projection , and grinned her thanks back at him .
tr	1	" The poison 's taking hold , " she said with conviction .
tr	0	For suddenly the dragon had lurched about and went crashing off through the bushes .
tr	2	" A little more and we 'll -- " " Crom ! "
tr	0	A great black mass of mystery , it reared cryptically against the moonlit sky .
tr	4	The roaring dragons of the distant forest were like a dim dream .
tr	0	And she had not taken advantage of his fright and the weakness resulting from it .
tr	2	After all , he reflected , his companion was no common woman .
tr	3	The sun rose up behind the city , turning the towers to a sinister crimson .
tr	4	A silence as absolute as that of the forest brooded over the walls and minarets .
tr	4	Valerian stared over her shoulder , and made a sound indicative of surprise .
tr	2	Nowhere did they find any windows , or doors opening into streets or courts .
tr	1	I 'm tired of wandering through these bare rooms at random . "
tr	3	It was a faint noise that brought him out of his reflections .
tr	1	The sight of a human being in this supposedly deserted city was a startling shock .
tr	1	She was afraid , trembling in the grip of some dire terror .
tr	2	On tiptoe she glided across the hall and vanished through an open door .
tr	3	The thing moved out from the wall and a grotesque shadows moved with it .
tr	1	She was gibbering in the Stygian tongue , though in a dialect unfamiliar to her .
tr	2	" Keep your hands off me , or I 'll split your skull .
tr	4	But we became separated and I returned here to find him with her gullet slit .
tr	0	At the thought she shook as with a ague and her dark skin grew ashy .
tr	2	But you are our friend , or you would not have slain my enemy .
tr	1	Smite as she would , she could not break past nor beat down his guard .
tr	4	The whole city is built like one giant palace under one great roof .
tr	3	A monster they have brought out of the catacombs to aid them !
tr	3	" That was a shrewd cut I dealt it on the stair . "
tr	4	But unlike the other rooms they had traversed , this hall showed evidences of occupation .
tr	2	The hall ended in an ornate door , before which stood no guard .
tr	2	She pointed to a black column of ebony which stood behind the dais .
tr	1	You will spend the rest of your lives in this city ! "
tr	4	" They slay each other , but no woman ever killed a dragon !
tr	2	If you don 't believe me , go and look for yourself . "
tr	2	" I just like to know what sort of harbor I 'm dropping anchor in .
tr	2	No , I don 't want you to sleep at the foot of my couch .
tr	1	I 'm not accustomed to being waited on -- not by men , anyway .
tr	1	He was sinking into scented billows of insensible bliss , when something touched his face .
tr	3	The man made no reply , but sought to cast away the object .
tr	0	Valerian turned and tore a handful of cords from a near-by hanging .
tr	1	Valerian reeled backward , shaking and clawing the stinging liquid out of his eyes .
tr	3	The pirate was after his instantly , sword out and murder in his heart .
tr	0	Regaining his chamber , he closed the door and shot the bolt behind him .
tr	3	Nor was there any to say what had prompted that mad attempt .
tr	1	Valerian fought beside her , his lips smiling and his eyes blazing .
tr	4	Some dying woman on the floor had fleshed her dagger with her last effort .
tr	0	" I will stake my head upon it that we have slain them all .
tr	4	As each woman set foot over the threshold she stared and glared wildly about her .
tr	2	" Couldn 't you have done it just as well in the throne room ? "
tr	1	A moment later she was hurrying from the chamber , carrying his in her arms .
tr	2	" You cannot be such a dog as to do this thing !
tr	3	She was too utterly cynical to be at all interested in his thoughts or opinions .
tr	1	The liquor slopped over , stinging his lips , splashing down on his naked pectorals .
tr	4	His laughter was less merciful than the ring of flint on steel .
tr	2	" Once , in your youth , you spoke words of love .
tr	4	Olmec strode back to her , bent and gripped her by the hair .
tr	0	Valerian swore softly and tugged vainly , with his legs braced against the chair .
tr	4	Olmec presently returned alone ; behind his a muffled groaning issued from the chamber .
tr	2	" I have chosen you for a great honor , " he said .
tr	2	I am old , so old I do not remember my childhood .
tr	2	I am Olmec , whose youth your own glorious youth shall restore . "
tr	0	" Why , the filthy -- " " No , no ! "
tr	3	That 's one thing that has reduced the clan to its present state .
tr	1	Only Olmec and I know , and he thinks me helpless and you slain .
tr	4	She might have been an image of primal strength cut out of bronze .
tr	0	A young man knelt at the other end of the altar , grasping his ankles .
tr	0	Rags only partly covered her gaunt frame , revealing half-naked limbs strangely unnatural in appearance .
tr	0	She had dwelt apart from humanity so long that she was no longer human .
tr	0	And bodies fell like falling leaves about the altar and at the doors .
tr	2	This ebook may not be resold or given away to other people .
tr	0	All the boats at the small marina were present and accounted for .
tr	1	Ain 't had a blow like this since ... when was it ?
tr	3	Lucas stopped in about this time every day to catch a few minutes .
tr	4	Most summer homes on the Rump had been in the same families for generations anyway .
tr	0	They 'd had only four guests in February , and eight in all of March .
tr	3	There weren 't many kids , but it wasn 't all bad .
tr	1	Turning , he looked at his mother and saw she was smiling .
tr	2	Cobb knew most of the two dozen or so people gathered around .
tr	2	He smiled and nodded to one or two while making his way through .
tr	1	The ranger gestured toward a blond kid with short hair standing away from the crowd .
tr	4	Chris recounted the story , embarrassed there wasn 't much to tell .
tr	0	That done , he turned and put his hands on his hips .
tr	3	After that , you see mostly octagonal pegs in ship construction . "
tr	2	The reporter wrote down a note or two before composing his next question .
tr	3	" I mean for them to just ... show up like this . "
tr	0	Halfway across , the ranger saw the cop shake his head at all the activity .
tr	0	In the middle of his photography , Lucas caught Haskins eye and waved him over .
tr	0	" That 's gon na be hard to do , " Lucas replied .
tr	1	" It 's a pleasure to meet you , " Haskins said .
tr	4	" Marine archeologists will be along in the next few days , " Haskins answered .
tr	3	He couldn 't wait for Chris to tell him all about it .
tr	4	He recalled her saying once that her favorite toy growing up had been a dollhouse .
tr	0	Misty was an older woman whose eight children had all moved away .
tr	4	When he heard she wanted to interview him , he made himself scarce .
tr	0	They all had a real good belly laugh at the Cape Cod rubes .
tr	3	But his mother was so proud he just kept that to himself .
tr	1	Chris went to his history class with Mr. Cobb on Tuesdays and Thursdays .
tr	4	Chris began moving slowly from one to the next , examining each of them closely .
tr	3	Whatever it was , it was something he couldn 't quite put his finger on .
tr	0	Probably not a fair question , given they 've practically made it illegal nowadays .
tr	3	He pointed to another index card that looked to have larger sticks on it .
tr	4	Though whimpering with the obvious desire to bark , the dog seemed to understand implicitly .
tr	3	It had always saddened him to think that one day there 'd be nothing left .
tr	3	But to think that day might be today angered him beyond measure .
tr	2	The motors got louder as the boats moved closer and then suddenly cut off .
tr	0	He heard a hushed cough followed by an urgent " shush ! "
tr	0	and moments later heard a crunching sound as the boats met sand .
tr	2	The dog wagged its tail , cocked its head , and licked his hand .
tr	0	Then again , the instructions on the colorful packaging had made it easy .
tr	1	Looking up , he saw their orange trails glowing like tracers in the night sky .
tr	0	He chalked it up to an unfamiliar firework going off , or maybe a dud .
tr	0	Whatever the man was shouting , it was another language to Chris .
tr	0	" Happy to hear it , Sparky , " the man said anyway .
tr	1	" Important for us big shots to work just as hard as our underlings .
tr	2	Goes without saying we 're looking forward to having you be a part of us .
tr	2	If it was good enough then , it 's good enough now . "
tr	3	It was just the sort of thing that would come in handy right about now .
tr	2	Gon na have my boys send over a copy of the contracts .
tr	2	You do know we quiz our managers on this , don 't you ?
tr	2	But you 'll find out one way or the other before long .
tr	2	~ The sound of motors faded as the boats moved further from shore .
tr	4	Setting aside their hurried desertion of the place , they otherwise seemed like professionals .
tr	0	Anyway , that was a problem for Lucas or the Park Service , not him .
tr	3	There really wasn 't anything he could do about that now , was there ?
tr	3	But it was late and he was tired and he just wanted to get home .
tr	0	She would kill him if she knew how much he snuck out .
tr	3	She 'd be disappointed in him , and that was the worst punishment of all .
tr	3	After thinking about it for a moment , he got an idea .
tr	4	His voice was low , with the guttural cadence of a longtime smoker .
tr	2	" But sure 'n it do give off a powerful glow . "
tr	4	He had no idea how he 'd ever explain being with this strange person .
tr	1	His eyes at first narrowed , as if he were suspicious about something .
tr	1	" Ah , ' tis mighty Christian of you , boy , " he said .
tr	0	Ahh , now this be what I call a hat ... " Chris sighed .
tr	3	Chris wasn 't sure how he felt about that , but nodded anyway .
tr	3	But she stopped to talk to Misty Rowling and Chris knew that could take forever .
tr	4	" Sure 'n we make a grand entrance , don 't we ladies ?
tr	2	Occasionally , someone did come out to start their car and head for home .
tr	1	But there was something else in his eyes too , something suspicious .
tr	3	It took Chris a moment to realize the man had nodded toward the clothes bin .
tr	3	Chris was named after his grandfather , but was too polite to mention it .
tr	4	Before he could object , the deed was done and the man began to speak .
tr	2	Chris didn 't know how to respond to that , so he just nodded .
tr	2	There you are , " Cobb said , coming out the door looking agitated .
tr	0	Chris glanced at Cobb and saw his mouth was a stern line .
tr	0	While walking , Chris glanced again at Cobb and saw him staring back .
tr	1	Standing , he put his hands on his hips and went on .
tr	1	And I 'm surprised I don 't see empty cans laying around .
tr	2	Boston or Portsmouth or Quincy or any of a half-dozen more places . "
tr	2	Cobb turned to Quinn , who mercifully also had his back to the dune .
tr	3	Tuning them out , Chris turned his attention back to the man on the dune .
tr	1	Cobb said triumphantly , though Chris had missed most of the discussion .
tr	4	When after a moment he did speak , his eyes never left the wreck .
tr	0	' Tis a look ya need always be on guard agin . "
tr	3	He be comin ' ta stare at it , ta touch it .
tr	4	Mostly , Chris remembered Cobb calling the wreck " what we 've discovered . "
tr	1	Chris 's own role in the discovery was mentioned less and less .
tr	2	" Well ... I 've got to go now , " Chris told the man .
tr	4	There were another two stories below that were lost to their vision .
tr	1	" What do you mean , " Chris asked , not understanding .
tr	3	But for a while now , it hadn 't felt that way .
tr	1	~ On Tuesday afternoon as usual , Chris was over Cobb 's house .
tr	0	Anyway , he had to admit there was a certain charm about him .
tr	2	Cobb took a moment to finish what he 'd been typing before looking up .
tr	0	Chris answered , " What you and the ranger talked about on Sunday .
tr	1	Cobb 's face went hazy a moment , thinking back on the encounter .
tr	0	Not as big as Vasa , mind you , but certainly bigger than Mary Rose .
tr	3	Exciting was about the last word Chris would use to describe it .
tr	0	He 'd rather be doing quadratic equations or having a cavity filled .
tr	4	But mostly , he needed to know more about the Lady Grace .
tr	2	The tools were of the sort that could have come from anyone 's basement workshop .
tr	0	It was fun for families and a cheap date for the younger folks .
tr	0	All but the Indian had scarves tied around their heads and necks .
tr	3	But specifically requesting that he sit down to dinner with her and Misty ?
tr	0	Yawning , Chris glanced at the clock and saw it was past midnight .
tr	3	Chris took a moment to pretend to think about it and then shook his head .
tr	0	To the east soared dozens of masts from sailboats moored at a private marina .
tr	4	After close to two hours in the dentist 's chair , he was finally free .
tr	3	Not much bigger or wider than the Internet closet back at the inn .
tr	3	But still , that should cover the first year anyway , don 't you think ?
tr	0	" Ah , thank you laddie , " he said , taking it .
tr	0	Chris had no idea what he was talking about and didn 't care to ask .
tr	0	But what I think he 's gon na do is take the ship away somehow .
tr	3	Whatever it was , it wasn 't interesting enough for the dog to venture further .
tr	0	I canna thank ya enough for both yer hospitality and yer company .
tr	4	As he executed his bow , Chris asked , " Where you been staying ? "
tr	1	Though I must say , what passes for ale these days be sorely lacking .
tr	2	" And you know , you really shouldn 't use them around town .
tr	0	The coin man looked down and saw it was a soap opera magazine .
tr	3	The coin man took it and placed it down on the velvet mat .
tr	2	But I 'll be happy to tell you all about it . "
tr	4	~ " No , you were right to tell me about it , Earle .
tr	2	Lots of bikers come in to get new ink down the tattoo parlor .
tr	3	" Though to be honest , I might just think that because of their accents .
tr	2	Now , it was long and untamed , falling well below her shoulders .
tr	3	He took it out of the bag and handed it to her .
tr	0	And do you know there are allowable amounts of rat hair and feces in them ?
tr	1	See this shirt , and these pants , and the sandals ? "
tr	0	He swallowed down the last of his sandwich and wiped his mouth with his sleeve .
tr	2	" What , you think I don 't know where you go ?
tr	1	Chris asked , unconsciously running his fingers along his once rubbed red raw neck .
tr	0	The man cleaning windows at the ice cream parlor saw Chris walk by and waved .
tr	1	" I 'm not gon na hit ya , " Chris said .
tr	0	Chris thought back to the various men he had ... shepherded back into this world .
tr	0	I always figured it was the captain 's reputation , ya know ?
tr	0	Rain like a waterfall , an ' hail the size of fists .
tr	0	But as always , the captain acted as if it were nothin ' unusual .
tr	3	But the captain said no , kep ' insisting we stay bound for the north .
tr	1	Run us onto a sandbar , knockin ' a hole in the hull .
tr	2	" Well , we found him now , didn 't we ? "
tr	4	" In fact , I expect by now , he 's already been hung . "
tr	1	Clem was watching bowling on television while Perry was busy with a scratch ticket .
tr	0	But the second was harsher , pushing him off to the side .
tr	1	" I ain 't yet heard the evidence , " Billy said with authority .
tr	2	Billy turned to look at one of the men in the front row .
tr	1	Looking chastened , the man named Fletcher stood slowly and crossed his massive arms .
tr	2	A grim sort , Chris thought , and probably not a man you should cross .
tr	4	You were in pursuit of a prize on that voyage , weren 't you ? "
tr	0	Chris thought he might have seen a slight twitch beneath the captain 's right eye .
tr	0	" We was chasing Black Sam , " a soft voice said .
tr	3	Walking to his right , he took a chair directly beneath the captain .
tr	1	With his eyes still closed , he felt a soft hand on his shoulder .
tr	1	The shaking in Chris 's legs subsided , but his heart still raced .
tr	0	Chris had no idea what she was talking about , but nodded anyway .
tr	4	" They prefer to be called ... privateers , " he said .
tr	0	And it looked now as if the captain was about to speak .
tr	1	With a hun 're d an ' fifty men an thirty guns ?
tr	0	An ' fer that , an ' only that , I do apologize . "
tr	2	You all swore an oath that during chase he was to be obeyed without objection .
tr	2	The captain broke the code by not telling you and has apologized for it .
tr	2	He again moved too close to the captain 's chair for Chris 's comfort .
tr	3	After their silent contemplation , quiet talking broke out among the men .
tr	2	He paused a moment to glance around the room before going on .
tr	0	" ... that ye shall live , an ' ye shall remain our captain . "
tr	4	Chris felt the blood begin to flow in his leg as Sarah removed her hand .
tr	2	She was still applauding wildly , but he noted she wasn 't looking at him .
tr	1	" Yes , it was , " Chris said , almost to himself .
tr	3	Chris returned home after the captain 's acquittal to help his mother around the inn .
tr	4	It had been weeks since Arthur Cobb determined the identity of the ship .
tr	0	After the two had walked a bit , the captain spoke again .
tr	3	Most important , whatever ye do , stay away from the damned Tarot .
tr	1	" It jes makes no sense , is all , " he said .
tr	2	Though it took a moment , Chris felt the blood drain from his face .
tr	1	He stopped walking and bent over , putting his hands on his knees .
tr	3	Yet there was no reason in the world to share that with the captain .
tr	4	After the news broke , Cobb did what he could to mitigate the damage .
tr	0	Perhaps most remarkable of all was the heavy item now cradled in his arms .
tr	1	" Think I 'm gon na get some air , " he said .
tr	3	In the bright light of intermittent lightning , he saw other ships across the water .
tr	1	As curious as he was , it wasn 't his business to ask .
tr	0	Though Chris couldn 't see most of it , he knew what was happening .
tr	0	Raising the Lady Grace had taken about an hour and a half .
tr	3	They were nothing new to Chris , often staying at the inn throughout the summer .
tr	4	" I mean , you can 't stay in the ... here .
tr	2	It 's ... well , it won 't work , is all . "
tr	4	Whoever this woman was , when she cursed you , you were cursed but good .
tr	3	But they 're still being hunted , so it 's still touch and go .
tr	4	When Chris went quiet , Sarah asked , " What about the emus ? "
tr	0	" I know about emus and llamas and zebras and giraffes and one old monkey .
tr	4	As they walked home , Sarah stayed quiet a while before opening up .
tr	0	Should make the thing light up the night sky , is all . "
tr	0	He started walking again , and when he joined Sarah the two walked together again .
tr	3	Chris could understand why that was important in their line of work .
tr	1	~ The meeting was held in the dining room of Barney 's mansion .
tr	1	He was busy reading something or other and not paying much attention .
tr	1	Open on the table in front of him was his ubiquitous briefcase .
tr	3	But as always , the lawyer kept his thoughts on the matter to himself .
tr	1	" So what 's your plan , son , " he asked .
tr	2	Faraway looks had come into both sets of eyes at the mention of home .
tr	4	Truth be told , ye already been far kinder than we deserve .
tr	2	~ After he had detailed his plan , Barney smiled and nodded knowingly .
tr	3	Two ran for their usual seats at the bar nearest the door .
tr	4	After a long pause , Angelina confessed she didn 't know who the father was .
tr	0	Leaning back , Lucas saw the man who had spoke was an odd-looking duck .
tr	4	But the Cove was HIS place , while they had places of their own .
tr	0	When he shared that thought with Dale , his art teacher smiled widely .
tr	0	The two began walking again , past the shops and toward the green .
tr	2	" I know where you can get your wood , " Chris said .
tr	1	He didn 't know exactly what , and couldn 't prove anything anyway .
tr	4	On an intellectual level , he knew the park ranger was right .
tr	4	Tool bags left behind with no visible sign of where they 'd come from .
tr	4	The management subcommittee of the board also needed to be notified immediately .
tr	3	He turned to Lucas and saw that he still didn 't understand .
tr	1	In fact , swords of all kinds are among our company 's biggest sellers . "
tr	3	With swords in their hands now , you couldn 't help but see it .
tr	4	It was the exact word the security guard had used to describe them .
tr	3	But the fact it wasn 't included in the news report clinched it for Arthur .
tr	2	One that people would have to pay to see , no doubt .
tr	3	Who would have the motive and the opportunity ... no , that wasn 't right .
tr	3	But even if it wasn 't the furniture dealer , it didn 't matter .
tr	3	Besides , he was starting to think the local cop was an idiot .
tr	1	" You may not remember me , but my name is Arthur Cobb .
tr	4	Halfway there , he nodded to a young couple hurrying in that direction .
tr	0	In a chair beside him sat Barney Zimmerman , who smiled at Chris 's approach .
tr	2	" By now , no doubt , ye all know young Master Christopher .
tr	1	the crew shouted , raising their own cups and cheering in Chris 's direction .
tr	4	There was more shushing from nearby blankets , but the crew paid no attention .
tr	4	He sent a wink and a smile her way before turning back to the screen .
tr	3	Frankly , he hadn 't thought them a big deal at the time .
tr	1	By dismissing it as nothing , he 'd already blown it once .
tr	0	Another marching band followed , and Chris knew the short parade was almost over .
tr	3	It didn 't matter , because as expected , Pickett was still at his desk .
tr	0	Seth was told the original IBM PC had come with a metal keyboard .
tr	3	But ... I got ta ask ... " Seth was surprised at the hesitation .
tr	3	Seth wasn 't prepared for this , so he 'd just have to wing it .
tr	1	It 's ... well , his mind is going , I 'm afraid .
tr	1	" I was simply trying to be helpful , " Cobb said .
tr	3	But the storm did unearth a number of artifacts that escaped earlier excavation efforts .
tr	4	" The National Seashore belongs to the Park Service , " Cobb said .
tr	2	" You know , there 's something else I want to show you .
tr	4	Her port side rested on a series of ramps spaced evenly apart .
tr	3	But what astonished Chris the most was the hull appeared almost complete .
tr	4	From the ground , they saw far more activity than met the naked eye above .
tr	4	Moments later , another man showed up with an empty basket and the cycle repeated .
tr	2	" Don ' know ' bout that , " Billy replied playfully .
tr	0	Sarah nodded , and the two started back the way they had come .
tr	4	Hell , it could have been the Cove for all he knew .
tr	4	He raised his eyebrows and said , " Can I help you ? "
tr	4	" Buddy , these are showing up all over the place . "
tr	0	Lucas didn 't want to play hardball , but would if he had to .
tr	3	You and me both , brother , Lucas thought , as the man went on .
tr	1	Lucas had no opinion on James K. Polk and so remained silent .
tr	0	" Can 't say as I got any names , but ... wait .
tr	0	Came in here about a month , maybe a month and a half ago . "
tr	1	Cut out of the newspaper with scissors , it spanned two pages .
tr	0	Above the article on the first page was a photo of a smiling Arthur Cobb .
tr	0	Cobb had absolutely no idea what he was getting himself involved in , Chris thought .
tr	4	-- Howard Pyle Chapter Fifteen ~ Summer flew by , as only summers can .
tr	0	He started to chuckle and chew again , and she laughed along .
tr	4	" There 's not much to tell , really , " he began .
tr	1	Funny , and you know , she only told me this once .
tr	2	I know lots of folks do it because of religion or whatnot .
tr	1	When that happens , I go into a kind of panic , you know ?
tr	0	But he was always making jokes , or pulling pranks on my mother .
tr	0	" So anyway ... " he said , turning to Sarah and smiling .
tr	1	Sarah and Chris hurried over and waited for the show to begin .
tr	4	The engineer barked out an order for the first team to go .
tr	0	Chris spared one glance for the captain , high above it all .
tr	0	Only then did Chris turn away to glance at what he 'd looked at earlier .
tr	3	Oh well , he thought , imagining that Pickett worked on Sundays anyway .
tr	0	The story concerned the travails of a man on vacation with his family .
tr	4	He just needed to put all the pieces together , find where they all fit .
tr	3	No , he wasn 't sure the minister had anything further to add .
tr	3	No , he wasn 't going to share that with the cop .
tr	0	The water was now above his waist so he was just about ready .
tr	2	" Oh , so that 's how it 's gon na be ? "
tr	1	" You 're turning a shade of red not normally seen in nature . "
tr	4	As they passed the Captain 's Cove , Chris heard something else familiar .
tr	1	Anyway , he knew it could 've been just about anyone in town .
tr	3	After the two sat down , Chris didn 't know quite how to begin .
tr	2	So why would they blame you for something you didn 't do ? "
tr	3	That was the only way I could think ta be rid of the thing .
tr	2	Wouldn ' dream of takin ' our first voyage without ya . "
tr	4	Chapter Seventeen ~ It was after midnight when the men assembled down at the marina .
tr	2	Each was assigned to one of a dozen or so small or medium sized boats .
tr	2	One by one , motors started and the boats began pulling away from the dock .
tr	3	The two stepped out beneath the starlit sky and walked down to the beach .
tr	1	The massively bright snowball in front was as big as ten stars .
tr	2	Just enough to allow him to get a word or two out .
tr	2	You got tings don ' belong to ya , do you not ? "
tr	3	" Think that 's it , Captain , " the voice said .
tr	0	Halfway to the ship , Chris heard the high-pitched ringing of a bell .
tr	3	It 's time fer ye to be getting ' the tour . "
tr	0	Sarah asked if he was excited about going home , and he was .
tr	1	Still puzzled , thinking something just wasn 't right , Chris hurriedly followed .
tr	4	After the ignominy of last evening , he had no desire to face the world .
tr	0	" Shh , shh , " the man said , not unkindly .
tr	4	I overheard ' em makin ' their plans an ' followed ' em here .
tr	0	So no , I ain 't in any hurry to leave here at all .
tr	0	The captain stared back at him with a gleam in his eye .
tr	2	" You 're going to make me do this , aren 't you ? "
tr	3	Then , Chris saw the wall of the boathouse start to move .
tr	4	After it slipped beneath without incident , a cheer went up among the crew .
tr	4	The two leaned back in awe as the powerful vessel surged ahead .
tr	3	And don 't think that wasn 't the first thing he planned to do .
tr	3	He turned from the window and saw Calvin Pickett sitting alone at their table .
tr	0	He could understand why he hadn 't brought along his board members .
tr	3	Glancing at his watch , Seth saw it was just before two .
tr	0	~ Chris and Sarah held tight to the railing throughout their hellish rollercoaster ride .
tr	0	Today , Barney was dressed in a sharp suit and red tie .
tr	3	He wasn 't quite sure what was so special about the sixth contract .
tr	4	" Heard you was under the weather , Barney , " Pickett said .
tr	3	Seth was doing what was in the best interests of the company .
tr	0	" I have no doubt of that , Calvin , " he said .
tr	2	You shouldn 't at all have to modify your standard of living .
tr	3	" That 's what the lawyers call it , " Pickett responded .
tr	2	Let him jot down any ideas or random thoughts you may have .
tr	2	How quick can you get to Muncie , and how are your Lotus 1-2-3 skills ?
tr	2	Gon na have to brush up on those to work for me .
tr	1	Chris smiled to hear Barney again call it " his " ship .
tr	0	Billy smiled and thanked him , assuring Chris he 'd take advantage .
tr	3	Spotlights from Barney 's estate above came on , shining brightly down toward the ship .
tr	1	Placing it around his waist while walking , he buckled it without missing a stride .
tr	1	Letting go of Sarah 's hand , he began running across the deck .
tr	1	Raising his hand , he shouted , " Wait ... wait ... wait ! "
tr	4	he shouted one more time , meeting the captain 's stare before turning again .
tr	3	It took more than a moment for Chris to realize they were pointing at him .
tr	0	The state police captain was apparently a man who didn 't appreciate being interrupted .
tr	3	Turning to his lieutenant , he said , " Arrest that man . "
tr	2	" You 're not going to do that , " Dawkins said .
tr	4	As the confused silence lingered , an anxious Cobb stepped forward to fill it .
tr	1	" If I may , I think I can clear up any confusion . "
tr	1	" Mister Haskins , " he said , addressing the Park Service archeologist .
tr	0	~ Chris watched the back and forth like a ping pong game .
tr	0	during one particularly heated exchange , and all Chris could do was shrug .
tr	3	He figured that after this , he might just have to get used to that .
tr	2	" It 's what I 've been telling you all along , Chris .
tr	3	The captain threw something toward him , which Lucas instinctively reached out and caught .
tr	0	" Alas , I don 't expect so , " the captain answered sadly .
tr	2	Lucas thought for a moment before glancing toward Quinn , who nodded imperceptibly .
tr	0	In fact , we wouldn ' dream of leavin ' without ya . "
tr	0	At that same moment , a heavy mist began washing up over the boat .
tr	4	" Going back in time ... going back to where they came from .
tr	3	Isn 't that going to change the way everything is now ? "
tr	4	Chris almost smiled , thinking about all the time travel movies he 'd seen .
tr	1	It was Chris 's turn to take a moment to phrase his response .
tr	2	And if it was good enough for Einstein , it was good enough for Chris .
tr	4	Barney had joined the pirates on their adventure to who knew where .
tr	1	He felt a pang of sadness at the loss of his friend .
tr	2	" He loved you , you know , " Dawkins said out of the blue .
tr	3	But the lightning they glimpsed across the water had a curious greenish tint to it .
tr	3	Anyway , there 's plenty of time for us to talk about that . "
tr	4	" Every one of them has long passages lifted from other things .
tr	0	And so , the roadblocks to Barney 's plans were at an end . "
tr	2	Another loud thunderclap followed by a brilliant flash of green lightning illuminated the sky .
tr	1	" The cook has prepared some snacks in the salon , " Dawkins said .
tr	0	And it was long past time for him to find a head .
tr	3	She had continued rubbing his back throughout , and he hesitated for that to stop .
tr	2	Couple of discounted burgers or sodas was really all it amounted to .
tr	0	~ A Note from the Author : Thanks for taking a chance on Swash !
tr	1	I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it .
tr	2	From humor to horror , I 've got the H 's covered .
tr	0	A charming and hilarious tale sure to delight baseball fans of all ages .
tr	2	This eBook may not be resold or given away to other people .
tr	3	This is my fifteenth death in the last four hundred and fifty years .
tr	3	I blinked at the drops that struck my face and slowly climbed to my feet .
tr	2	As for me , the bruises would start to fade by tomorrow .
tr	2	The voice had gone blank , devoid of all traces of emotion .
tr	4	' I know , ' I muttered in the same neutral tone .
tr	4	Water dripped onto the leather cover and formed a puddle by my feet .
tr	2	He took something from his raincoat and tossed it across to me .
tr	3	That was when I learned one of the most important lessons about immortals .
tr	3	Thirty minutes later , we were sitting in a booth in Betty 's Cafe .
tr	2	Betty 's opened forty years ago in what is now a prime location in Roxbury .
tr	0	' That doesn 't mean I have to carry a gun . '
tr	1	I looked away from his piercing gaze and shifted uneasily in my seat .
tr	0	Even I had to admit that Louisiana had been an ugly affair .
tr	2	Reid pulled up behind a hot dog vendor and went inside the building .
tr	3	Shortly after , it pulled off the highway and turned into a side road .
tr	0	Sandy loam crunched softly beneath our boots as we made our way towards the alley .
tr	1	The blares of car horns carried on the wind from the distant toll bridge .
tr	1	Reid was lying stiffly next to the bank of industrial sewing machines .
tr	4	' That 's not good , ' I said bleakly , meeting his eyes .
tr	0	A jagged piece of metal tore a gash across the back of my left hand .
tr	1	That 's what I would do if I were in his shoes .
tr	3	I turned with the faintest misgiving and let the current carry me north .
tr	3	Moments later , the Hayabusa roared through the dark streets of the city .
tr	4	He looked down and fingered the holes in his fine wool , roll neck sweater .
tr	2	A few crows spiralled out of the night sky and landed on the rooftop .
tr	3	It was difficult to tell whether my partner 's voice held disgust or admiration .
tr	4	We had ridden to the docks earlier that morning to retrieve the Chevy .
tr	2	Our landlady had called about our overdue rent , her tone somewhat cool .
tr	3	' That 's the name Haus mentioned last night , ' I said dully .
tr	1	' I don 't think so , ' I replied , shaking my head .
tr	0	' And I think he faked his own death , somehow . '
tr	4	' Do I look like I 'm fit to chase felines up trees ?
tr	1	I also sensed I would jeopardise our friendship if I did so .
tr	4	Her cat , a silver tabby , had gone missing two weeks previously .
tr	0	The apartment was small and neat , and smelled faintly of vanilla .
tr	4	Hands covered in paper-thin skin and fine spidery veins touched the photograph .
tr	1	' We 'll do our best to find him , ' I said quietly .
tr	2	I 'm going to the park to look for the cat . '
tr	0	Half an hour later , I had completed my search of the park .
tr	1	Several squirrels and strays had shown interest in the bag in my hands .
tr	4	I stared thoughtfully at the dim passages before crossing the road to the nearest one .
tr	3	I stepped over the railing and took a cautious step towards it .
tr	2	I looked up at a sudden loud hiss in front of me .
tr	3	If truth be told , I was getting tired of being shot at .
tr	4	As I negotiated the dingy corridors of the empty building , my phone beeped again .
tr	4	An emergency door finally materialised at the end of the next passage .
tr	3	' You said you left the victim 's apartment at around thirteen hundred ? '
tr	3	It was evidently a tactic he used to try and unsettle potential suspects .
tr	2	' I scoured the neighbourhood and the park across the road . '
tr	1	' I don 't like guns , ' I said , neatly sidestepping the question .
tr	2	' So , what 're you gon na do about it ? '
tr	4	A faint orange glow smudged the skyline ahead and to the left .
tr	2	' Yes , he did , ' I acknowledged with a nod .
tr	1	' He likes you , ' I said with a faint grin .
tr	0	I paused in the act of loading firearms and magazines into the second bag .
tr	4	' Because I have a feeling I 'm going to die . '
tr	4	he added with a frown when he climbed into the passenger seat of the 4x4 .
tr	2	' You boys aren 't in some kinda trouble now , are you ? '
tr	3	' That 's not what I 'm thinking about , ' said Reid .
tr	3	It had taken a quarter of an hour to lose the two SUVs tracking us .
tr	1	I crossed Broadway and Park Avenue , and finally turned right onto Lexington .
tr	4	The room was drowned in deep reds , purples and rich earth tones .
tr	0	I paused by a tall , black leather and cherry wood stool .
tr	4	' Hello , Pierre , ' I said quietly to the man behind the counter .
tr	1	' You were like a stuntman on the Nürburgring , ' Reid retorted darkly .
tr	1	' I 'm surprised a patrol car didn 't pull us over . '
tr	1	' It consists of the Regional Division directors under each Head of Section .
tr	1	' I have rarely known them kill a human in such an open fashion . '
tr	3	' However , our contact might be able to point you in the right direction .
tr	1	' Let 's go , ' I said , glancing at Reid .
tr	2	We said our goodbyes and left the building through the back door .
tr	2	' You guys normally go through official channels for this kind of intel . '
tr	3	' That 's all I could get my hands on for the time being .
tr	4	I mean , he doesn 't even have a speeding ticket to his name . '
tr	3	I stared at the copy of an article from the Washington Post .
tr	3	' What is it that they 're trying to do , exactly ? '
tr	1	I couldn 't find any copies filed with Building and Land Regulation . '
tr	1	' I 'll let you know if I find anything else . '
tr	2	' There 's a temporary felony want out for you in Boston .
tr	1	' Meyer 's going to issue a warrant for my arrest . '
tr	2	' Do I even wan na know how you learned to do that ? '
tr	0	' Who the hell keeps that kind of thing in his house ? '
tr	1	I thought that was only possible in movies , ' said Reid .
tr	3	I turned to the computer and typed Strauss in the search box .
tr	2	Blood had seeped through the bandage around his wound and stained his trousers .
tr	2	You 're probably not gon na be able to ID any of them . '
tr	4	A small , wizened elderly man peered at us through the narrow crack .
tr	1	' A little bit , ' I said with a faint smile .
tr	4	A few curious faces appeared in an open doorway to the left .
tr	0	The old man gestured frantically and shouted a few sharp words in Mandarin .
tr	3	Qin Lee waited until the door closed at the top of the stairs .
tr	1	' I need some passports for him , amongst other things . '
tr	1	A sigh left his lips : he knew not to ask for the reasons why .
tr	4	We watched the car do a screeching U-turn and hurtle erratically down the runway .
tr	3	I grinned at the short , portly middle-aged French man with the thick moustache .
tr	4	He greeted Reid like an old acquaintance and ushered us inside the building .
tr	0	' Actually , I do have a question , ' I said after a while .
tr	2	I 'm afraid one of you will have to sleep on the sofa .
tr	1	said the man in a frail voice , blinking in the porch light .
tr	2	Seconds later the old woman frowned , sighed softly and closed the door .
tr	1	I tried the door handle ; it twisted easily in my grip .
tr	0	The interior of the apartment was inky black and as still as a tomb .
tr	0	The air was stifling and overlaid with a faint stench of decay .
tr	1	Dust motes danced in the narrow beam as it swept across the vast space .
tr	1	Only the paintings in the drawing room and bedrooms had been left untouched .
tr	1	' I 'm afraid not , ' I replied with an apologetic smile .
tr	1	' I 'm glad to hear it , ' I said wryly .
tr	2	Next to the board , another door opened onto a small office .
tr	3	An empty picture frame stood adjacent to a dying cactus plant on the window sill .
tr	4	The roadster was still some hundred feet away , in the shadow of another building .
tr	4	Despite the tension humming through my body , I kept my expression carefully neutral .
tr	4	By the time the screams started , Reid and I were already running .
tr	1	I raised my gun and fired , still racing for the roadster .
tr	1	Reid 's voice finally made it through the ringing in my head .
tr	4	I shifted gear and headed towards the north exit of the campus .
tr	4	Birds erupted from the trees that lined the carriageway at the sound of screeching tires .
tr	1	He gripped the gun in both hands and fired twice in rapid succession .
tr	3	It almost lost control , righted itself at the last moment and resumed the pursuit .
tr	4	' That 's a shame , ' he continued in the same relaxed tone .
tr	3	' They just lifted the rocket launcher out through the sunroof . '
tr	4	A glance at the rear view mirror showed the SUV thirty feet behind and closing .
tr	4	Flames erupted from beneath the hood and rapidly engulfed the front of the vehicle .
tr	3	' I still don 't see what any of this has to do with you .
tr	0	Yet , I felt I was still far from arriving at any answers .
tr	1	' No , it 'll only make things worse , ' said Reid .
tr	1	The latter did not return it ; instead a frown marred his reddening brow .
tr	1	' The number Strauss had been calling is also in Zurich . '
tr	3	To the south , the fading sunlight glistened on the distant peaks of the Alps .
tr	4	Lights came on in the neighbouring house as we stepped onto the lawn .
tr	1	An imposing antique Louis XVI desk occupied the space in front of the main window .
tr	1	' This is interesting , ' Reid said a few minutes later .
tr	0	Strauss had forwarded the email to a third party on a separate server .
tr	4	He rose and brought the map on the bed over to the table .
tr	3	An armed guard stood unobtrusively next to a potted palm tree to our left .
tr	0	He transferred a rather substantial amount of money to your bank a fortnight ago .
tr	4	He transferred another one hundred thousand Euros into the account four weeks later .
tr	3	From there it was a short walk across the park to the university .
tr	0	One flight up , a glass security door appeared in our path .
tr	2	A couple of students strolled down the steps from the floor above .
tr	4	' On the other hand , we could always break the fire glass . '
tr	2	A young woman was approaching the security door from the opposite side .
tr	4	We moved silently aside as she crossed the threshold , her head cast down .
tr	4	A shocked gasp left her lips and the files fell out of her arms .
tr	2	We swiped through the security door and headed down a wide corridor .
tr	0	' It 's a rather delicate matter , I 'm afraid . '
tr	1	' We haven 't seen or heard from Anna in a fortnight . '
tr	1	' I 'm afraid I don 't know , ' I replied truthfully .
tr	1	' I didn 't think it was important , ' he said , flushing slightly .
tr	0	She was wearing a cream coat and hat , ' he replied .
tr	3	It took us twelve minutes to get to the Hauptbahnhof on the tram .
tr	0	A blonde woman in a cream camel coat was disappearing into a glass lift .
tr	0	It was a skill that had come in handy in many of our past investigations .
tr	3	She fell to the ground with a soft thud and lay still .
tr	3	Hunters materialized from behind the columns and escalators that punctuated the mall .
tr	2	The sound of gunshots echoed to the roof of the shopping mall .
tr	1	A harsh cry erupted from my right , drowning the background noise .
tr	3	I turned and fired at a Hunter next to the stairs on my left .
tr	4	The immortal who faced me paused and frowned , the sword raised above his head .
tr	0	I turned and saw a black 4x4 pull out of a parking space .
tr	3	A grunt left my lips as my hip struck the metal rail .
tr	1	The crowd on the busy strip scattered , panicked shouts rising towards the sunny skies .
tr	4	A second SUV was racing up the packed avenue towards the couple .
tr	2	I dropped the Glock and lifted the Smith and Wesson in my right hand .
tr	4	One of Reid 's bullets had pierced the petrol tank of the first 4x4 .
tr	2	I slowly lowered the gun and fought to control the tremor in my hands .
tr	0	' So , you wan na tell me what that was about back there ? '
tr	2	' Most of the immortals who know of me are Hunters . '
tr	4	I crossed the busy square and led Reid down a narrow , nondescript side street .
tr	3	Halfway along the street stood one of the oldest pubs in the city .
tr	3	Soft lighting painted the interior walls of the tavern in muted shadows .
tr	4	I looked up into the large , bearded face of the bartender .
tr	3	He waited until the disgruntled young woman left before turning to us with a grin .
tr	4	I studied the bartender carefully while the hubbub of conversation gradually resumed around us .
tr	1	' I 'm afraid that beer is no longer in production , sir . '
tr	1	' Yes , I was , ' I replied with a faint smile .
tr	0	' For my sins , ' said the bartender with a hearty laugh .
tr	1	I believe he 's in Vienna tonight , ' I said in a low voice .
tr	0	' I 'm afraid I really do have to insist that you leave . '
tr	3	At three in the morning , the last patrons finally left the bar .
tr	4	There were faint , fresh black scuff marks on the dry stone floor .
tr	4	A faint orange glow ahead finally alerted us to the presence of the bartender .
tr	2	It took a couple of minutes to find the subtle oval depression in the stonework .
tr	4	I stepped back , raised my leg and kicked sharply at the lock .
tr	3	' Look , we just want to talk to them , ' said Reid .
tr	0	Finally , he sighed and rubbed a hand tiredly across his face .
tr	3	But right now the safety of our other friends is paramount ! '
tr	3	The katana hissed through the air , moonlight glinting on the edge of the metal .
tr	0	The man was good , but nowhere near as good as Haus had been .
tr	4	I raced towards the running figures , my feet splashing in the bloodstained water .
tr	0	A second later , I swung the katana and caught him across the arm .
tr	2	Out of the corner of my eyes , I saw Anna look around wildly .
tr	1	A soft grunt left his lips as the bloodstained katana slashed across his neck .
tr	4	Blood seeped between her slim fingers where they lay on the old man 's clothes .
tr	2	' I told you not to follow us , ' he said harshly .
tr	3	With Anna supporting her grandfather on the other side , they started up the stairs .
tr	0	Blood had soaked into the waistband of his trousers and sweat beaded his pale face .
tr	0	For now , we have to get Tomas and Anna to a safe house . '
tr	4	I glanced at the skyline above the rooftops while the unfamiliar roads unrolled before us .
tr	1	The figures riding pillion had pulled semi-automatic guns out of their jackets .
tr	4	The tires squealed shrilly while the acrid smell of burning rubber rose around us .
tr	2	The shock jolted us all forward and buckled the hood of the Skoda .
tr	3	The Bastian driver turned the key in the ignition : the car stuttered and stalled .
tr	1	Victor 's bodyguard and the driver of the Skoda shifted slowly as consciousness returned .
tr	2	The bodyguard nodded and rubbed the back of his head with a wince .
tr	3	' Have I mentioned that this is turning out to be a shitty day ? '
tr	3	The sirens that been blasting through the crisp morning air stopped abruptly .
tr	0	I had been so close to Anna Godard and the answers that I sought .
tr	1	' It 's irony , definitely irony , ' Reid muttered at my side .
tr	2	' What do you know about the murder of Professor Strauss ? '
tr	0	That his body miraculously reappeared in his apartment after you left ? '
tr	1	' We did not kill Hubert Strauss , ' I said emphatically .
tr	2	This was probably going to be our one and only chance to escape .
tr	1	' Yes , ' I said , struggling to maintain my composure .
tr	0	' Oh , there 's no rush , ' the immortal said calmly .
tr	1	We rose from behind the counter and raced for the security door on our right .
tr	0	' It 's like Christmas come early , ' Anatole said with a weak grin .
tr	2	' Look , there 's no need for all of us to stay .
tr	1	The boss gave us strict orders to look after your sorry asses .
tr	2	Four of them lay on the floor , apparently dead from shots to the head .
tr	4	He folded silently at my feet , a look of stunned surprise on his face .
tr	4	He swore when the katana carved a deep cut on the underside of his arm .
tr	2	' There 're a lot of things you don 't know about me . '
tr	4	And because the man who killed my father holds you dear to his heart ! '
tr	1	Olsson grunted ; his knuckles whitened as he pressed down with his sword .
tr	3	Though they hit the vest , I still gasped at the stinging pain .
tr	2	Blood oozed from a cut on his face and the shallow wound on his shoulder .
tr	1	The Volvo owner 's hand shook as he slowly passed the keys across .
tr	0	A young woman cowered behind a parked van a few yards away .
tr	1	The smell of burning rubber filled the air as the car shot forward .
tr	3	' Tell me you 're not thinking of -- ' he started to say warily .
tr	4	I glanced at the rear view mirror at the sound of an explosion .
tr	2	Anatole drifted in and out of consciousness for most of the drive up .
tr	0	' He 'll live if he makes it through the night . '
tr	4	' Victor received an urgent request for help from Tomas Godard late yesterday afternoon .
tr	1	He swallowed a mouthful of whisky and paused , as if choosing his words carefully .
tr	1	' He is true nobility , if you know what I mean . '
tr	1	I gazed at him silently while the meaning behind his words sank in .
tr	4	Reid 's eyes narrowed and his gaze shifted from Bruno to me .
tr	1	Amber liquid splashed into his glass as he poured in more whisky .
tr	1	' I 'm only on my tenth , ' said Bruno finally .
tr	1	' It 's Victor , ' he said , his stance visibly relaxing .
tr	1	' I 'd rather Tomas did the explaining , ' he said tiredly .
tr	0	I glanced out of the window as we drove past a small hamlet .
tr	2	Burning bricks , wood and smouldering debris drifted down slowly around the clearing .
tr	1	Glass popped and cracked inside the burning building as further explosions shook its foundations .
tr	1	I placed my hand firmly on his arm , stopping him in his tracks .
tr	4	Dead leaves and branches snapped beneath our feet when we entered the woods .
tr	0	He lay on his back in a shallow puddle of inky water .
tr	1	He lifted a hand to his chest and stared at his crimson fingers .
tr	4	I blinked fresh blood out of my eyes and twisted on my knees .
tr	3	I didn 't have to look to tell that I was bleeding heavily .
tr	0	I almost missed the first swing of his blade and lurched backward awkwardly .
tr	0	A spasm of guilt and anguish racked my body , almost paralysing in its intensity .
tr	1	I frowned , my knuckles whitening on the handle of the katana .
tr	2	I stood frozen for a moment , before falling to my knees once more .
tr	3	' Tell your mother and father that Felix Thorne says hi ! '
tr	4	They were faint but insistent , like echoes in a vast and watery tunnel .
tr	1	After waxing and waning for an eternity , it faded once more .
tr	3	There wasn 't an inch of me that did not seem to be hurting .
tr	2	' It took us to the woods on the other side of the hill . '
tr	0	There was a fresh dressing on his forehead and a bandage around his hand .
tr	0	I glanced from him to Anna and tried to sit up again .
tr	0	That was when I saw the bandages encircling my chest and flanks .
tr	1	She strode briskly across the room and snatched the roll from his lips .
tr	1	The least you could do is not smoke , ' she said sharply .
tr	1	' Your granddaughter 's infringing on my rights , ' Reid explained blandly .
tr	4	She shooed the three men out of the room and paused on the threshold .
tr	3	' I sent them out to get provisions , ' Victor replied .
tr	0	Anna 's head whipped around at the sound and she frowned at him .
tr	2	I stiffened , a tremor of shock coursing through me at his words .
tr	0	I said in a low voice , almost afraid to hear the answer .
tr	0	' I am your grandfather , ' he said in a clear voice .
tr	2	Victor took a sip of his coffee and put the cup down carefully .
tr	1	This time , I was unable to hide the fury in my voice .
tr	3	' Yes , I thought so too , from that time forth . '
tr	1	On their tenth year in hiding , the Hunters finally found them .
tr	3	' But -- the old man said you tried to stop the Hunters . '
tr	0	' She was a hundred years younger than you , ' said Tomas .
tr	3	I stared at my grandfather and asked the one that troubled me the most .
tr	1	' Victor and I debated this time and time again , ' he said .
tr	4	I have to admit , I nearly gave myself away the second time . '
tr	3	I stared at him , unable to voice the feelings that choked my throat .
tr	0	I thought of his words at the Hauptbahnhof and finally understood their meaning .
tr	3	A door slammed at the front of the house , startling us all .
tr	0	' Hubert was a Professor in molecular genetics , ' said Anna .
tr	1	' So you were trying to find a cure for cancer ? '
tr	4	We were attempting to -- well , control the disease , really . '
tr	0	' I was promised my own lab and as many research assistants as I wanted .
tr	1	' I 'm afraid he isn 't , ' said Victor wryly .
tr	0	' What could be a bigger find than a cure for cancer ? '
tr	3	' He was staying at their farm until I returned to Zurich . '
tr	1	I contacted Grandfather for help shortly after our return from Italy . '
tr	3	' Thankfully , they couldn 't get past the security on the safe .
tr	0	A flash of envy stabbed through me as I looked at the smiling pair .
tr	4	Shocked at the unexpected emotion , I turned and caught Reid 's shrewd stare .
tr	1	' Yes , ' I said , not showing the least sign of remorse .
tr	3	' I think he was too afraid to write down what it was exactly . '
tr	2	She shot out of her chair and crossed the room to where I stood .
tr	0	Anna took the diary from my hands and leafed through the last few pages .
tr	3	' Write down what you want , ' said Victor with a curt nod .
tr	4	' Roman and the entire Order of Bastian Hunters will be behind us .
tr	1	' You should try and get some sleep , ' said Anna softly .
tr	0	She walked around the desk and placed a hand on her grandfather 's arm .
tr	3	He loved nothing more than coming up with the most intricate ciphers . '
tr	0	' That 's a drawing of an Okazaki fragment , ' she said .
tr	3	The feeling that I had just touched on something significant would not go away .
tr	0	An hour later , Anna was on the final page of Strauss ' diary .
tr	1	I murmured , still trying to absorb the staggering implication behind Strauss 's research findings .
tr	2	I rose from my seat when she stood up abruptly and ran from the room .
tr	0	Her hands shook slightly when she placed it on the table in front of her .
tr	3	Although I knew the answer , I still had to ask the question .
tr	0	A low chuckle left Anna 's lips as she stared down at her hands .
tr	2	' Hubert didn 't know it was my blood , ' she said .
tr	3	Victor returned to the kitchen moments later , a thoughtful look on his face .
tr	1	' They 're taking him to Linz , ' Victor continued , ignoring the interruption .
tr	2	' I 'm sending the two of you to collect him . '
tr	4	' You 're not allowed to rough him up , ' he added tersely .
tr	1	said Anatole with an enthusiastic grin , punching the air with his fist .
tr	4	The sun was sinking towards the horizon when a noise woke me hours later .
tr	2	' Not only does he know , he thoroughly approves , ' Victor said coldly .
tr	0	' You have no idea what you 're up against this time .
tr	3	Undaunted , the little man spat out a cracked tooth and sneered .
tr	2	You 're going to set the rest of your dogs loose on me ? '
tr	0	' You know as well as I do that he has never attacked an immortal .
tr	1	I put a hand on his arm and felt the rigid tension running through him .
tr	4	The anger that had been burning inside me for days seemed to have melted away .
tr	1	I watched understanding begin to dawn on the man 's startled face .
tr	4	He leaned against the window frame next to me and gazed outside .
tr	3	' Much better than I thought it 'd be , ' he said thoughtfully .
tr	3	Several armed Hunters stood to attention next to the windows and doors of the kitchen .
tr	1	He ignored Anna 's scowl and nonchalantly blew out a couple of smoke rings .
tr	3	' Sorry boss , but half the men out there know about it already . '
tr	2	' Soul did , ' Victor stated loudly above the furore that followed .
tr	0	No one in our history has the ability that he has . '
tr	1	As I was rapidly discovering , she was too stubborn to resist a challenge .
tr	1	' Victor and I are intending to drop in for a visit . '
tr	3	' That 's suicide , ' the man next to Roman said dully .
tr	4	' This team needs to be small ; three , four men at the most .
tr	1	I shrugged , silently indicating that the choice was his to make .
tr	0	An idea had been taking shape in my mind for the last two days .
tr	3	Someone had cleared their throat in a deliberate attempt to gain our attention .
tr	1	' Lucas was just showing me how to use a gun . '
tr	3	Amongst them were the Bastian nobles that made up the First Council .
tr	2	Tomas Godard stood slightly to the side , his face full of a nameless emotion .
tr	2	' Do you know a man by the name of Mikael Olsson ? '
tr	0	' I knew a Johan Olsson once , ' said Godard after a thoughtful pause .
tr	0	' You know where I am if you wan na talk . '
tr	2	' You 're good to go , ' said a voice after several seconds .
tr	4	Dusty wine racks lined the floor in even rows that extended to a low ceiling .
tr	4	' Damn , ' the red-haired immortal finally murmured in wide-eyed awe .
tr	2	' You 're still good to go , ' said the voice in my ear .
tr	3	' All right , ' he finally muttered with a curt nod .
tr	2	' Three bodies moving towards you from the front of the house .
tr	1	' Thanks , ' I murmured , studying the passage we stood in .
tr	4	A third man dressed in a white evening suit followed behind them .
tr	2	The Hunters took up position on either side of the door as he closed it .
tr	1	' Hi , ' I said with an engaging smile and raised my empty hands .
tr	0	' I 'm getting a high background heat signal from that place .
tr	0	If that happened , I would have to reboot and start all over again .
tr	1	' None of you stand a chance against Thorne , ' I interrupted bluntly .
tr	0	Our blades clashed again and again , sparks rising from the gleaming steel edges .
tr	1	It slipped an inch past his guard and scored a gash across his chest .
tr	4	I deflected all his strikes with an ease that enraged him to no end .
tr	0	I broke his attack with the katana and forced him back a step .
tr	0	' Thanks , ' I gasped gratefully and looked up into Costas 's grim face .
tr	2	' Someone had to get your sorry asses out of there . '
tr	4	Except for some scratches , everyone appeared to be in one piece .
tr	1	' I met her , ' I said , my voice devoid of emotion .
tr	2	He strode across the floor and pulled me roughly into his arms .
tr	1	If the older man noticed , he did not give any indication of it .
tr	3	' That 's the data from Hubert 's latest research , ' she said impatiently .
tr	3	' All right , let 's look at the next file , ' said Victor .
tr	0	Tomas Godard sat down heavily in an armchair , his face grey .
tr	3	' Let me get something straight , ' he said with a frown .
tr	0	' Can they actually do any of this without Anna 's blood ? '
tr	3	' The worst part was that most of those who survived became infertile . '
tr	1	' If this virus is set loose -- ' He lapsed into abrupt silence .
tr	1	' If he 's going then so am I , ' said Reid .
tr	0	We climbed into a pair of vans and drove away from the estate .
tr	1	His full lips , straight wide nose and strong jaw suggested a Slavic ancestry .
tr	2	You don 't look a day older than the last time I saw you . '
tr	4	' As rude as ever , I see , ' he grumbled .
tr	3	' You just bring out the best in me , ' he said lightly .
tr	1	' I 'm with him , ' Reid replied , cocking his thumb my way .
tr	4	' Their men are loyal to them , as are mine . '
tr	2	' Half of them do so out of greed and a hunger for power .
tr	2	' Will you really be able to kill your own kin in cold blood ? '
tr	1	The wind picked up , causing ripples to course across the grass .
tr	0	' Yes , ' I finally said in a cold and steady tone .
tr	0	Victor stopped a passing Hunter in his tracks and handed him a sheet of paper .
tr	0	Tomas Godard appeared next to Anna and laid a hand on her shoulder .
tr	4	Anna placed her fingers over her grandfather 's and stared at me intently .
tr	0	I frowned as I stared at the black chopper landing on the lawn .
tr	0	' We have to gather as many troops as we can . '
tr	3	' There 's a strong possibility that the rest of the tunnel is unstable .
tr	2	It took an hour for the digger to move the core of the debris .
tr	3	The air was dry and choked with the dust stirred up by the excavation .
tr	3	To be truthful , I was not particularly comfortable with confined underground spaces either .
tr	3	Months spent in the battle trenches during the First World War had seen to that .
tr	4	Half a mile later , a faint whine emerged in the distance .
tr	3	' The fans in the south-west ventilation shaft , ' murmured Friedrich .
tr	4	We gazed over the threshold into the bowels of a modern elevator shaft .
tr	2	A single , narrow access door stood in the north wall of the structure .
tr	4	' As ready as we 'll ever be , I guess , ' he murmured .
tr	2	A second door appeared on the other side of the boiler room .
tr	4	' The labs should be a couple of levels beneath us , ' said Friedrich .
tr	4	Two storeys below , we came to a high containment , stainless steel door .
tr	3	' That 'll take too long , ' I said with a frown .
tr	0	We paused at a crossroad and studied another pair of empty hallways .
tr	2	Another set of glass doors stood closed on the other side of the room .
tr	2	I paused in front of the doors leading to the next room .
tr	0	' It must lead to a decontamination room and a sterile lab . '
tr	1	' We 're not having this discussion again , ' he said gruffly .
tr	2	I turned towards the doorway , where Bruno and Anatole stood watching us .
tr	4	Several IVs were hooked to her arms and a central line dangled from her neck .
tr	4	Reid 's eyes widened in consternation as he slowly moved to the second bed .
tr	3	It was obvious that he could not see clearly through the visor of the suit .
tr	0	I looked around the room , my heart slamming a rapid tempo against my ribs .
tr	1	I finally found what I was searching for inside one of the trolleys .
tr	0	Reid stared as I tied a tourniquet around the dead man 's arm .
tr	3	' What the hell makes you think I 'm going to leave without you ? '
tr	2	In that time , more explosions rocked the foundations of the underground facility .
tr	3	Seconds later , a strip light shattered onto the wall of rubble .
tr	2	' This place is about to come down on our heads ! '
tr	3	' Everyone suspects that I might be truly immortal , ' I said patiently .
tr	3	' Now 's as good a time as any to test that theory . '
tr	1	I caught the immortal 's faintly murmured words as we turned the corner .
tr	1	' I don 't think so , ' I replied with a sinking feeling .
tr	3	Dirt trickled out in a minor landslide near the bottom of the barricade .
tr	2	Blood oozed from a jagged , gaping wound on his grimy forehead .
tr	2	The whole corridor shook violently as another explosion rocked the underground lab .
tr	1	Pipes burst around us , releasing jets of hot steam that further obscured our vision .
tr	2	I blinked and coughed dirt out of my mouth before looking around slowly .
tr	1	Reid was climbing to his feet a few yards to my right .
tr	0	' Hell , talk about bad luck , ' he said flatly after a pause .
tr	3	I stared at the wall , a smile tugging at the corners of my mouth .
tr	1	Friedrich grunted and took a thin coil of climbing rope from his belt bag .
tr	4	Reid headed swiftly across the duct with one end of the rope .
tr	3	A jagged crack tore through the east wall of the ventilation shaft .
tr	0	I looked past Reid 's anxious face and stared at the distant roof .
tr	1	My arms and legs shook from the strain of carrying the injured immortal .
tr	0	Hands reached through my earthy tomb and dragged me into a clear space .
tr	2	Blood oozed from a cut on his head and the fresh scrapes on his knuckles .
tr	3	I said presently , gazing at Victor through the transparent barrier that separated us .
tr	0	' You 're a jackass , ' he stated darkly without preamble .
tr	3	And neither could I control the people staring in at me , I thought tiredly .
tr	3	The pod rocked slightly on its metal bed , jarring me along with it .
tr	0	We set off again and finally came to a stop several minutes later .
tr	1	Footsteps scuttled past the pod and shadows played across the glass port .
tr	1	' I can hear you , you know , ' I said mildly .
tr	3	' I 'm not ready to talk to you yet , ' she said harshly .
tr	3	The pod was lifted from the rear of the truck and onto a trolley .
tr	0	A glass wall appeared in front of me as I moved into a vertical position .
tr	0	I looked away from Godard 's stricken expression and gazed at her awkwardly .
tr	4	She reached out and lifted my left arm in her gloved hands .
tr	4	' Place your clothes in the plastic carrier inside and give them to me . '
tr	2	' We should know within the next twenty-four hours if you develop any symptoms .
tr	0	By then , a pounding headache was already hammering at my temples .
tr	3	' It 's all right , ' I whispered , my teeth shattering uncontrollably .
tr	1	' I 'm going to be fine , ' I said more firmly .
tr	4	For the first time in days , her eyes were bright with barely concealed excitement .
tr	3	' You think this has something to do with surviving the seventeenth death ? '
tr	3	I stared at the glass wall , uncertain how I felt about that statement .
tr	2	' The virus is no longer detectable in your blood stream or your swabs .
tr	1	I said , unable to hide the hint of hope in my voice .
tr	1	' A bit stiff , but okay otherwise , ' I replied .
tr	2	Godard pulled me towards him and engulfed me in a tight hug .
tr	0	' Yeah , ' I murmured awkwardly , ' I get that a lot . '
tr	2	' You 'll do well not to question your superiors , Soul . '
tr	1	' I will not -- ' ' Lucas is right , ' Victor interrupted sharply .
tr	1	It was almost midnight when we finally ended our negotiations with the FBI and Interpol .
tr	4	I stared at the ceiling for what felt like hours before eventually drifting off .
tr	3	I lifted my head off the pillow and stared at the figure that stood there .
tr	4	He lit up , inhaled deeply and blew out a smoke ring .
tr	1	' It 's bigger than the FBI 's training grounds in Quantico . '
tr	2	You know far too much as it is , ' growled the Bastian Council member .
tr	1	Despite the anxiety humming through my veins , my lips twisted in a wry grin .
tr	2	' How did you guys get your hands on that kind of money ? '
tr	3	The new body armour they possess will protect their other vital points . '
tr	0	' Wasn 't gon na say a word , ' Reid said wryly .
tr	1	' It shouldn 't come as a surprise , really , ' said Victor .
tr	4	Bullets riddled the air and ricocheted against the walls when we charged into the corridor .
tr	4	Victor shouted , indicating the fire escape at the end of the passage .
tr	3	Halfway to the next landing , the sound of gunshots rose up from the stairwell .
tr	0	On the landing above , Costas and Lacroix had already ploughed through several Hunters .
tr	4	Most of them were breathing heavily , while others looked ready to fall .
tr	4	Flashes of light and smoke filled the air as gunfire exploded around us .
tr	0	The katana flashed and sliced through their ribs in rapid succession a moment later .
tr	4	Seconds later , I reached the next landing and opened the fire door .
tr	0	' We found a pass for the lift , ' said Anatole with a grin .
tr	0	As Anatole reached for the handle , a familiar whine reached my ears .
tr	4	Coughing at the acrid haze , we rose and darted swiftly across the threshold .
tr	2	A pair of French doors stood open in the middle of it .
tr	3	I was sitting on a kerb some thousand feet from the waters of the Potomac .
tr	2	' You just jumped from an exploding aircraft into the twelfth floor of a skyscraper .
tr	0	And you probably have a hairline fracture under that gash in your head ! '
tr	2	' We 'll be able to help millions of people with this . '
tr	4	' We have to move fast , ' Victor finally said with a sombre expression .
tr	4	It was another half hour before we were able to leave Arlington .
tr	3	' This isn 't the end of the matter , is it ? '
tr	3	But I 'm afraid we can 't involve you further than this . '
tr	3	I looked at the Frenchman steadily and tried to mask my mounting agitation .
tr	2	' Well , good luck , ' he finally muttered with a sigh .
tr	3	Moments later , the first bodies started to appear across the grounds .
tr	3	We found the largest group of Bastian Hunters at the top of the rise .
tr	4	His words were barely audible above the muted explosion from a nearby building .
tr	4	Moments later , the monitor flickered and a room appeared on the screen .
tr	2	A sculptured oak table stood in the middle of a flagstone floor .
tr	2	' We still have to vote on it , of course . '
tr	4	He glanced around the chamber , his gaze lingering on several faces .
tr	3	' With or without your help , I 'm going after them . '
tr	3	' Wow , you sure told them , ' Anatole murmured with a soft whistle .
tr	3	' It took me two hundred years to get him to exchange birthday cards . '
tr	2	' We got our hands on the vaccine , ' said Victor .
tr	3	' Does it have anything to do with matters at hand ? '
tr	0	They took Anna and Tomas Godard , ' Victor continued after a brief pause .
tr	4	She doesn 't need the approval of the First Council for urgent tactical decisions . '
tr	4	Dusk was falling across the mountains when I entered the main lodge a while later .
tr	2	' Never thought I 'd hear the bulldog defend you , ' Reid added drily .
tr	3	Narrow courtyards and labyrinthine paths intersected the extensive gardens that fronted it .
tr	2	He glanced at Costas , who stood scowling silently at the back of the room .
tr	2	Victor crossed the floor and stopped in front of the frowning immortal .
tr	3	You would think after all that time I 'd know the man inside out . '
tr	1	I said curtly , struggling to hide the anxious impatience in my voice .
tr	3	' But first , we have to consider the small matter of logistics . '
tr	1	It felt like a lifetime ago since I held Anna in my arms .
tr	2	I stepped off the plane onto hot , cracked asphalt and looked around .
tr	4	' That 's a sight you don 't see every day , ' said Reid .
tr	4	' Are these the two men you want me to coach ? '
tr	1	' That was good work , ' he said with a satisfied expression .
tr	1	' Dimitri and the remaining Council members arrived on the island an hour ago . '
tr	1	' Costas and I will be heading for the port in fifty minutes .
tr	3	Two of the major 's lieutenants had accompanied us on the flight .
tr	3	I caught the limp body and lowered it quietly to the ground .
tr	1	No cries of alarm sounded in the night ; our landing had gone undetected .
tr	4	We moved silently down the spiral staircase and reached the bottom moments later .
tr	1	I said in a low voice while Reid relieved him of his weapon .
tr	3	The Bastian tech knew which feed I meant without me having to spell it out .
tr	3	The Bastian tech guided us down a further two floors of the castle .
tr	0	' This is as far as I can take you , ' said the tech .
tr	1	I was surprised at how composed I felt at seeing him again .
tr	0	I grabbed a cable tie from my backpack and closed it around Olsson 's wrists .
tr	4	You have no idea what these people are capable of , do you ?
tr	2	I 'll never help you , so you might as well kill me now ! '
tr	3	' Looks like they started the party without us , ' said Reid .
tr	0	He came to a stop at my side and changed the magazine in his gun .
tr	2	' Costas and Bruno are holding the lower floors to the dock .
tr	2	I crossed the floor to the control panel next to the steel doors .
tr	4	' See you on the other side , ' Victor murmured from below .
tr	0	A heartbeat later , the blades arched and danced through the air .
tr	4	Moments later , we had secured the principal entrance to the underground facility .
tr	4	More guards appeared in our path the deeper we ventured inside the island .
tr	3	' Well , that should buy us what , a minute or two ? '
tr	4	They barely had time to raise their guns before they fell under the blades .
tr	1	I commanded harshly , indicating the sealed entrance in the containment wall .
tr	1	I said , lifting her gently and cradling her against my body .
tr	1	I turned and carried her briskly across the floor towards the exit .
tr	1	' This way , ' said Anna briskly , indicating the corridor to the left .
tr	1	' It 's bad , ' said the immortal with a firm nod .
tr	4	I glanced at her and saw my own horror reflected in her eyes .
tr	0	' Still , I fear you have made a grave mistake , ' said Godard .
tr	2	' My friends , ' she said once the clapping had died down .
tr	1	' I am pleased to see you in such good spirits . '
tr	2	Among the roar of approving voices that followed , one spoke up .
tr	3	We hear that the Bastian army is on their way to this fortress .
tr	0	He took a step towards the glass wall , a dark scowl clouding his face .
tr	2	' Don 't you dare lay a finger on them , you monster ! '
tr	4	A needle came down and perforated the rubber top of the container .
tr	4	I tied the other end of the line to a carabiner and turned to Anna .
tr	1	' I have to do this , ' I whispered against her lips .
tr	3	The Hunters raised their guns and started to shoot at the cage .
tr	4	I lowered the Glock and the Smith & Wesson and squeezed the triggers rapidly .
tr	1	' I 'll go first , ' he said and moved towards the stairs .
tr	0	I paused near the top of the stairs and scanned the hallway ahead .
tr	4	The katana blocked the edge of his sword an inch from Victor 's neck .
tr	2	Costas moved to Victor 's side and slowly lowered the bleeding immortal to the floor .
tr	1	Thorne moved forward with a hungry expression and brought his sword down with a grunt .
tr	1	It struck the floor an inch from my head , raising sparks from the stone .
tr	1	Blood rushing loudly in my ears , I kicked him in the leg .
tr	2	' Looks like you still lose , half-breed , ' Thorne gasped mockingly .
tr	0	I yanked the katana out of his heart and watched him drop to his knees .
tr	0	Her face contorted in a mask of horror while she stared at Anna .
tr	0	' Yes , ' Tomas Godard replied with more than a trace of satisfaction .
tr	1	' I 'm sorry , child , ' he murmured , his expression sorrowful .
tr	2	Godard raised a bloodied hand and touched his granddaughter 's face with shaking fingers .
tr	2	' I 've been waiting for this moment for so long . '
tr	2	I want you to know that I always loved ... you . '
tr	1	' I told him I was gon na shoot him , ' Reid muttered .
tr	4	Shocked relief washed over me , taking some of the numbness away .
tr	2	We walked out onto the rooftop , Anna following in our footsteps .
tr	4	Sun beams danced across emerald green waters , the light almost blinding in its radiance .
tr	0	Anna came out through the patio doors and paused by my side .
tr	4	' Did I hear someone mention the word " drinks " ? '
tr	0	I shook his hand briskly and turned to the man behind him .
tr	1	Ironically , Olsson 's demise at Reid 's hands had also been his final one .
tr	1	We had yet to tell Victor and Dimitri of this intriguing phenomenon .
tr	2	' How much do you know of the history of the immortals ? '
tr	3	' What if I was to tell you that this was not always the case ?
tr	3	' Of course , there 's a lot more to it than that . '
tr	3	' That 's impossible , ' Anna stated flatly in the silence that followed .
tr	1	' This one requires a lot more of it , I 'm afraid . '
tr	3	' What do you -- ' I started to say with a frown .
tr	2	I thought you deserved to know about our discovery as it concerned you directly .
tr	1	' I don 't think we 're likely to change our minds anytime soon . '
tr	1	' No , he isn 't , ' Anna said with a frown .
tr	0	Psychology teacher , shorter and bald , with a sharp mind that man .
tr	1	I sighted again , thinking that I never traveled with a ship before .
tr	4	I could not believe my own eyes , was my dead father .
tr	2	" Yes , but most likely we will pay loads of euros . "
tr	1	" I have no idea , but I think will be ok . "
tr	1	" Don 't worry , is not your fault , " she said stressful .
tr	3	I did not wish to draw attention and to speak with somebody .
tr	3	The people around start to stare at me but I didn 't care .
tr	0	" I 'm so sorry , was a traffic jam on my way here .
tr	0	" Chill " she said , putting her hand on my shoulder .
tr	1	I interrupted her ironically , and for my surprise , she started to laugh .
tr	2	Gosh , I woke you up , sorry , sometimes I 'm so rude " .
tr	4	She came with me from U.S.A ; she drove me insane with her boyfriend . "
tr	0	My name is Damian Jones / " " Pleasure and how you are called ? "
tr	3	" I am so sorry ... I ... " I start to agitated .
tr	1	" True , but in his case the illness is in an easy form .
tr	3	I jumped over my luggage and started to charge them chaotically with things and clothes .
tr	3	I took the elevator with the luggage after me , and pushed the downstairs button .
tr	1	I paid 15 euros to the driver and I was heading to the booking office .
tr	3	I simply cannot do it , plus that I feel lost here . "
tr	1	Now that I embarrassed enough , let 's do business , shall we ? "
tr	1	she said smiling with warm , giving me snakes in my stomach .
tr	2	You have to open yourself , to get if off from your chest .
tr	2	You will leave your luggage and then we 'll go and visit the Mill family .
tr	0	I made a scene of sickness at that thought , making Abby laugh .
tr	0	And like the first day , Helen waved her hand happily , making us laugh .
tr	0	We said thank you and take a seat on a white sofa , looking around .
tr	0	Abby looked at her and said joyfully : " You have a beautiful home . "
tr	1	Me and my husband are thinking to intern him to a hospital . "
tr	1	" Yes but what happens if his ill will not pass ? "
tr	1	" I ... can stay here " , I said whispering while Mrs. Mill left .
tr	3	In that moment , the boy got suddenly up , I jumped off my skin .
tr	3	I took a seat on the bed with Abby next to me .
tr	1	Lars was sitting down in front of us , on a chair .
tr	4	" She says that Greek people are difficult and they don 't speak English .
tr	0	He smiled , and I was so amazed how convincing Abby could be .
tr	4	" We are going in the club , " Abby said with red eyes .
tr	4	Laurence was talking about his dance competitions and Abby seemed very interested about his stories .
tr	0	" Abby , I hope that you are sure what you are doing . "
tr	4	Despite of Alex waking from Laurence and drown us in the sea .
tr	1	If it wasn 't for you , I would gave up my big dream . "
tr	1	I take fitness classes ; I want to look in shape . "
tr	1	The party , if I can named like this , was in full swing .
tr	0	" Lars , we 'll take a cab and get you home . "
tr	0	The all alcohol cleared , and a little headache started to annoy me .
tr	1	I mean ... she is a funny girl , beautiful , special .
tr	2	" We should go , " I said , looking at the watch .
tr	1	I love how she is sleeping , " he said , smiling .
tr	3	Her beautiful smile , that I could taste her sweet lips without satisfying .
tr	3	I went to bathroom and the first thing I did was a cold shower .
tr	3	Was nice to walk , my mind was cooling while my thought start to clear .
tr	3	I said polite , inviting her to seat next to me at the table .
tr	1	But why you said I will go instead of we will go ? "
tr	1	I curiously asked , even if I was happy that I would not go .
tr	2	" Ok , but promise me that you will tell no one .
tr	1	" You are ... a genius , " I shouted , jumping .
tr	2	" We can go home ... " " No we won 't !
tr	4	We will stay here and pretend that we are still working . "
tr	1	But I still had a dose of happiness , considering that Abby remained with me .
tr	2	She wants to know how you 're e managing so far . "
tr	0	Was an irony , considering that outside the sun was already a fireball .
tr	0	I said , didn 't want to seat all day in a hotel room .
tr	4	The created monster in me , whispered that Abigail Woods was lying .
tr	3	No ... I wanted to forget , but how to do that .
tr	0	And probably now , she was sharing with that handicap bastard , with rotten mind .
tr	0	So therefore I turned away back , and I knock down a girl , literally .
tr	1	I didn 't had no idea where was I. Clearly , I got lost .
tr	3	I just wanted to make sore that I was crazy and not intuitive .
tr	1	I came from London , which is the capital of the Grand Britain . "
tr	1	But formally is called The United Kingdom of Grand Britain and North Ireland . "
tr	0	I checked my phone and saw that I had a message from Abby .
tr	4	From her voice , I could notice that she was more then upset on me .
tr	2	" So ... for ... for you I am just ... a friend ? "
tr	2	Go up , calm down , rest and we will talk tomorrow . "
tr	2	I don 't have to look in every single seaport bars or in parks .
tr	0	Somehow was a good thing that my jealousy was passing away , disappearing from me .
tr	2	" Hello mother , yes I am ... no , I am not ok .
tr	2	" Mom , I want for you to tell me something very honestly .
tr	1	I felt so much pain for this and having so much spite .
tr	1	I felt that I was choking in my pain , but what could I do .
tr	0	I grab her in my arms but she was still shaking and calling me .
tr	3	In that moment , the Minotaur hit me , throwing me away .
tr	2	He got closer to Abby and with a stroke ... I woke up .
tr	0	I realized that I was dreaming and I started to breath easily .
tr	0	I felt my face heavy from so much crying , and my back was hurting .
tr	0	I did not saw Abby at the breakfast and for that , I was relieved .
tr	2	To be an open book for her and after that to burn me down ?
tr	0	" Damian ... I want ... I want to apologize for the past days .
tr	1	Even if I , somehow , had an intuition what will be next .
tr	0	You 're ... " " I 'm an ass , that 's who I am !
tr	4	Not because he can harm her , but because she loves him .
tr	4	You were my dear friend and hugged me when I was sad . "
tr	1	I smile , but still my intuition did not left me alone .
tr	2	I knocked softly on the door , waiting bored but no answer .
tr	0	Not again , why I always have to find out details from Helen ?
tr	2	So off I go from the hotel outside , starting to cry .
tr	0	He was the only person on that island in which I put faith .
tr	1	" H ... hello " I managed to say , from running .
tr	3	" I want to know if the ferry to Athens already left . "
tr	3	The phone started to ring and I answer it fast , thought that was Damian .
tr	3	Nothing special , I ... just went with Damian to the ferry . "
tr	3	I prayed to not meet with Damian on my way to the hotel 's entrance .
tr	0	Anyway , I was sorry for doing that , because he wouldn 't go away .
tr	1	I didn 't like lying , but I don 't have a choice .
tr	2	Well you know , I look after Damian to not see me with you .
tr	3	And trust me , this is the last thing I want to do . "
tr	1	I realized that wasn 't a single building around , nothing like .
tr	1	Then he kissed me with passion , taking my fears from my shoulders .
tr	3	To bad you didn 't tell me that the restaurant was invisible . "
tr	1	I said that I will bring you to a special place to dinner . "
tr	3	On the table , I could see two plates with spaghetti , looking yummy .
tr	0	I was not surprised when I found out that he had a sexual fantasy there .
tr	1	" Ah ... I forgot , " He said , making me curious .
tr	3	I didn 't eat anything , just to eat with you tonight . "
tr	2	You are a part of me now , and I want to know you . "
tr	1	I 've seen a sign in which says something like private propriety . "
tr	4	Well it happened to me in the first year of high school .
tr	3	But after that I found out that he just wanted to sleep with me . "
tr	2	I really wouldn 't know how to react if I was you . "
tr	2	" Do you know if here it 's a toilette or something ?
tr	2	Was like when you want to go to bathroom and you hear the flowing water .
tr	3	We laughed together and then I went straight to the toilette with y little purse .
tr	3	Was pretty far , but I just loved to walk on the soft sand .
tr	3	I told them , that my ass is not for their faces .
tr	2	" What do you say about killing you if you 'll not get lost ? "
tr	0	He looked mad and angry , beating him hard , until the German collapse down .
tr	0	I was not able to talk anymore because of I was frighten .
tr	0	He put his hand on my shoulder and felt how I was shaking .
tr	1	He came closer to puts his hands on my hips , kissing me .
tr	2	" If you care about you life , then I suggest you to obey . "
tr	0	I asked for it , to have a crush on a lunatic .
tr	2	" Don 't you worry ; I will go with the girl from the reception .
tr	3	The arcade started to heal , but still that memory , scares me .
tr	1	But I refrain for thinking much farther , and I called Lars .
tr	4	" Yeah , in 10 minutes I 'll be at the hotel . "
tr	1	" I will meat with my boyfriend , how are you ? "
tr	2	You are not coming to shopping but you 're going out with a psychopath ?
tr	0	I didn 't say a word after that , walking away furious .
tr	0	After a couple of minutes , Lars and his mom came in .
tr	3	She told me that he was taking his breakfast at the restaurant .
tr	4	I was heading back to the reception and I 've seen him entering the elevator .
tr	3	Nothing , I already felt how my tears wanted to come out .
tr	0	" Damian ... I just ... wanted to apologize for the last days .
tr	4	" It is not our place any longer , since you spoiled with Laurence . "
tr	1	What a kick , his voice was so calm but still so harsh , cold .
tr	0	My hand was shaking and eventually he looked into my eyes , grabbing a chair .
tr	0	You 're ... " " I 'm an ass , that 's who I am !
tr	3	I opened my mouth but I didn 't know what to say .
tr	3	" I saw Alex last night , for the first time . "
tr	0	And in the end I managed to say : " Bye Damian . "
tr	0	I noticed Lars at a table in the back , waving his hand .
tr	3	" I really don 't know what to start with , trust me . "
tr	3	But if you like to start with the end , be my guest . "
tr	0	No matter what happened , I have a reason for this . "
tr	0	And I 'm afraid that the same thing will happen with you . "
tr	3	Maybe was not such a good idea to tell him the all truth .
tr	2	" Dad , how long it will take until we 'll get there ? "
tr	3	I didn 't got it , why the blonde had hills on that heats outside .
tr	3	" But you didn 't know at what time he will arrive ? "
tr	1	" Mara , this is my son 's girlfriend , Abigail Woods , or Abby .
tr	1	I pet him a little bit , while I was enjoying the coolness from inside .
tr	1	Me instead I took a seat on the bed , watching him suspiciously .
tr	1	He sighed , but still didn 't answer , having his attention on the unpacking .
tr	0	I watched him how he sighed again and somehow he was grudging me .
tr	2	" If you would really care about me , you would tell me . "
tr	3	" Why you don 't understand , that it 's better like this ? "
tr	2	I took a seat slowly , worried , trying to not make much noise .
tr	3	" Anyway , not about me I want to talk , but about you . "
tr	2	Somehow , I felt a sorrow when I pronounced the last word .
tr	2	When I spoke with him today , from three words , two were about you .
tr	2	It was a cute one , comfy , having light blue walls like color .
tr	0	I took a seat on a sofa , and she smiled at me .
tr	1	" If it 's possible , can I stay in Greece with Mill family ?
tr	0	At least a period , but Abby ... " " Yeah ? "
tr	1	On the other hand , Laurence was watching me in silent , thinking .
tr	3	He wasn 't smiling , and that thing putted me to think .
tr	3	A terrified thought drove my attention , namely that Laurence found out the truth .
tr	2	" All in good time , now let 's go for a walk . "
tr	2	I contacted you in your dream ; otherwise , I could not possibly do it .
tr	0	" Yeah , but you don 't actually die by your hand !
tr	0	He is still my son , and I am always with him no matter what .
tr	3	What he told me was that he and his mother don 't get that well .
tr	1	He is back to England ; I don 't know an address , nothing . "
tr	1	He smiled to me and without warning , took me in his arms with warm .
tr	4	I felt a hitch , because Laurence took my arm and turned me to him .
tr	2	Why do to so when Miss Woods cannot control her curiosity and ask everyone around .
tr	3	I 'm not stupid , I know that Mara told you everything .
tr	3	" Why are you trying to deny , and to not tell the truth ? "
tr	4	Laurence pouted and he slams his head on the back , looking up .
tr	4	You 're really making me seeking the truth from other sources . "
tr	0	" Mara is a extraordinary psychologist Lars , she can help you a lot . "
tr	2	" You could be hurt or something horrible happen to you . "
tr	1	I said firm , seating straight up , pointing to the door .
tr	2	Be careful for the door to not slam you when you get out . "
tr	2	I yelled and ran from my room outside , smashing the door on my way .
tr	2	I shouted , and the old woman hurried to open the door .
tr	1	I didn 't know what I was doing , I was like possessed by demons .
tr	3	Something was telling me that this all story wasn 't over yet .
tr	1	Was like I had schizophrenia , and the disease was putting imaginary things in front .
tr	0	Finally he answered , exactly when I was about to hang out .
tr	0	The first thing that I saw was Laurence 's beautiful masculine face .
tr	2	" Don 't worry , it 's a job already done . "
tr	2	" Of course , someone had to take care of you . "
tr	2	" You know Laurence , it 's something that you don 't know .
tr	1	He said , watching me with calm and smiling , taking my hand into his .
tr	2	From frowning , I made large eyes , almost popping from the orbits .
tr	4	Like I said , you are here because of me and of Mara .
tr	4	She helped me from a long time to be calm and temperamental .
tr	0	She already chose you and Damian for it , and asked my opinion .
tr	2	Not to mention your photo from it , I liked you since then .
tr	2	" Abigail Woods , do you want to be my wife ? "
tr	3	" I accept , but it 's my turn to put a condition . "
tr	0	I was seating at the airport , looking around for a cab .
tr	1	I was waiting quiet at my place , until I will get down .
tr	3	A lot of thought were crossing my mind , like a water torrent .
tr	0	I knew that , not in vain I was passionate about psychology .
tr	0	" Oh no ... No ... He didn 't take his phone with him . "
tr	2	" Do you ... do you think I am lying to you ? "
tr	3	Was royal after his family , but he quit the title for you .
tr	1	" I do not think it is such a good idea . "
tr	4	The nurse came back but this time with someone else , holding hands .
tr	2	I smiled myself when I saw it , not knowing how to control my tears .
tr	1	I smiled with all my mouth , having tears in my eyes .
tr	2	" Abby , my best and best and best and best friend . "
tr	4	Even if he remained in my soul , I will never forget that child face .

tr	0	I 'm aware of that , Mrs. Williams , " Furnace replied calmly .
tr	0	" That means a good dinner wasted , like as not . "
tr	1	" That 's none of our business , Mrs. Williams , " Furnace replied .
tr	2	It was dark outside , and dark clouds huddled over the moon .
tr	0	Slowly , she breathed on the windowpane again and wrote again : I AM PEARSON .
tr	3	" And how did I know that you were going to say just that ? "
tr	0	However , Nelly had a bony hand and was not afraid to use it .
tr	3	The entrance led to a sitting room that was lit by a cheerful fire .
tr	4	Virgil entered the room and a pleased smile appeared on his face .
tr	0	" She did wait , but your carriage was somewhat delayed . "
tr	0	" I leave it all in your very capable hands , my dear . "
tr	2	In the boys ' room , Neil was also lost in a nightmare .
tr	3	It opened onto a ledge that stuck out over a dizzying height .
tr	0	A woman was in the cage , and she looked up at him .
tr	2	As he shook the door , the bolt on the outside shot back .
tr	1	He pressed his hands over his ears and shouted , ' Turn it off !
tr	2	The music was so loud that he could not hear his own voice .
tr	3	His luggage included two other shirts and some underpants , and that was it .
tr	4	The house was a large one , built in the shape of a squared-off C .
tr	1	Neil picked his way past various urns and pots of well-tended flowers and bushes .
tr	4	They followed the path down to where it emerged from the woods .
tr	1	The sea lay in front of them and sparkled in the early morning sun .
tr	4	Neil thought it looked like giant 's cotton thread running through several huge needles .
tr	1	Simon plunged down the steps in breakneck fashion , with Neil following more slowly behind .
tr	2	Neil jumped onto the sand and followed Simon towards the towering cliffs .
tr	2	" I 'm not going to let up on you , you know .
tr	3	" But I honestly can 't ... " Simon lost interest in the conversation .
tr	3	" They 're not buttons , or levers , or anything like that . "
tr	2	A button would have some kind of rim or space to move in . "
tr	2	It looks as if it was moved there , on purpose . "
tr	1	" You look just like that Da Vinci drawing , " he said .
tr	1	Simon resumed his position , crossed his eyes , and stuck out his tongue .
tr	2	" I 'll not have all my bread stolen by the likes of you ! "
tr	0	Her footsteps died away and Miriam became absorbed in her story again .
tr	4	When she reached the end of the story , she looked up and sighed .
tr	3	" Don 't think you can talk to me like that ! "
tr	4	He hurriedly applied his finger to a brass button near the door on the wall .
tr	2	The door opened and Furnace stood , looking into the room without showing any emotion .
tr	0	Theodosia turned from the window and raised one hand as if brushing away a fly .
tr	3	It is all her fault that I forgot to do so ! "
tr	2	You have too much on your mind to worry about a little baggage like that .
tr	0	Scorching him with an impatient look , she pushed past him in the hall .
tr	1	" Mrs. Williams , if you would be so kind as to pass the mustard .
tr	1	" Theodosia , I always say you know best , but this must cease . "
tr	2	I 'm going to open a window to let in some fresh air . "
tr	0	Furnace adjusted the silver coffee urn a fraction of an inch and stood back .
tr	4	He picked up a delicate biscuit from the tray and began to nibble on it .
tr	2	Blowing out a shower of crumbs , he waved one hand at the visitor .
tr	2	Look here , the salary is only forty pounds per annum . "
tr	0	She sat back , folded her hands , and fixed him with a steady gaze .
tr	0	Mana took off a large apron , and quickly opened some drawers .
tr	0	" She wanted you to take a bath , and now you have . "
tr	1	Mana sat back on her heels , holding the stockings in one hand .
tr	2	" Fat lot of good you 'll do about it holed up in here . "
tr	3	Remarks like that are what I would expect an idiot to say , not you .
tr	1	Downstairs , Theodosia heard Miriam 's screams as Furnace closed the door .
tr	0	" Pick that up , and we 'll be on our way . "
tr	2	Without looking to see if Miriam obeyed or not , she left the room .
tr	3	Furnace put the port on the table and took the tray instead .
tr	2	In the sitting room , Theodosia idly leafed through a book of fashions .
tr	1	Smiling faintly , Theodosia said , " I knew how it would be .
tr	0	You will be put on bread and water , just as I said . "
tr	1	I will take care of Miriam 's punishments from now on . "
tr	2	" You will take care of Miriam 's punishments from now on . "
tr	0	Second , I am not a ' native ' ; I am an islander .
tr	1	You may be my only pupil , but I am indeed running a school . "
tr	0	Mana added a spot of milk to her cup and sipped her tea .
tr	2	" And if I do well , will you show me ? "
tr	3	Mana called a halt to their studies when lunch was sent up to the room .
tr	1	She imagined herself on horseback , riding as fast as she could with vital information .
tr	0	" Not bad , " Mana said , biting off a thread .
tr	2	" Mana , do I really have to move to another room ? "
tr	0	Miriam walked over , and Mana put her hand on the girl 's arm .
tr	2	Mana stood up , and pointed to a door in the corner of the room .
tr	1	" This is -- not bad , " Miriam said , looking around .
tr	2	" But , how did you know what was in my trunk ? "
tr	0	That friend he was walking around with outside is probably a scab too .
tr	1	The governess read a book and sang something softly in an unknown language .
tr	3	Mana turned to look at Miriam , but the girl slept peacefully .
tr	1	" Miss Miriam 's room no longer , " Furnace reminded him .
tr	1	Chapter 9 Miriam , Simon , and Neil his one 's a bit better . "
tr	2	Pick up that box of colors , and give me your sketchbook . "
tr	4	Miriam tumbled her pencils into the wooden box and squeezed it shut .
tr	1	The ' shining light ' was sitting in the library , scowling at his mother .
tr	3	Simon got up and exploded , " Don 't talk about him like that ! "
tr	2	Theodosia whirled on him , anxious to take her displeasure out on someone .
tr	3	" That 's near the West Indies , isn 't it ? "
tr	2	" And it 's imported by Pearson 's , " Miriam added .
tr	0	He couldn 't imagine his parents actually hiring someone who was a native .
tr	0	She had black curls escaping from a grey ribbon , and large , black eyes .
tr	2	" You 're staying in my room , " she said to Simon and left .
tr	0	" Well , tell me what your story is about , " Mana said .
tr	3	Miriam kept thinking of things that she wanted to add to her story .
tr	2	" And do not swallow your food without chewing , " Mana continued .
tr	1	" I think I 'm ready now , Mana , " Miriam said .
tr	2	" If you like , you may work on your story for a bit . "
tr	2	He went up to his room and picked up a few of his schoolbooks .
tr	4	He climbed onto the seat and drew the curtains closed behind him .
tr	3	Simon and Miriam both let their breaths out at the same moment .
tr	3	" Do you have a straw boater to go with that ? "
tr	4	She hesitated , and asked , " Promise not to laugh ? "
tr	4	" Just something she found in a secret hiding place before she was walled up .
tr	1	" It is a bit stubby , " Miriam admitted , handing it over .
tr	2	They both looked up at Theodosia , whose mouth opened in shock .
tr	0	" I will take care of Miriam , madam , " she said .
tr	0	Instantly , Miriam ran to her and clasped her arms around Mana 's waist .
tr	3	" That girl is outside of enough , " she stated without preamble .
tr	1	" I have been considering the profits , " Virgil said stiffly .
tr	1	" And we don 't want them involved , " Theodosia said , frowning .
tr	1	" It is all tied up in trust , " Virgil said .
tr	3	" Do you think that I haven 't been over this a thousand times ?
tr	2	Now , hand me that bottle of port , would you , my dear ? "
tr	4	" But I 've never been all the way down to the sand .
tr	3	" So I suppose that means that we can 't go . "
tr	0	A few minutes later , Miriam came flying down the stairs , hat in hand .
tr	0	" You forgot your coat , " Mana said as Miriam danced up to her .
tr	1	Mana cut off Simon 's response , and said , " Isn 't it obvious ?
tr	4	" Perhaps they are only there for the day , " Mana answered calmly .
tr	2	" Islands don 't move around from one latitude to another ! "
tr	0	Miriam asked , " What is the name of Little Star in your language ? "
tr	3	" I 'll expect you to draw the biggest thing you catch . "
tr	3	Simon instantly wielded the net and managed to get it into the largest jar .
tr	3	" Look at its disgusting legs , and those little wiggly things in its center .
tr	4	You 'll need to refresh the water from time to time as well . "
tr	1	" You 'll never get it off now , " Miriam said .
tr	2	" Come on , I 'm going to look for prawns . "
tr	0	She held out a loaded plate , which he took with alacrity .
tr	0	" Don 't get cheeky , " Mana said , leaning back against a rock .
tr	1	I don 't see why I put up with him , do you ? "
tr	2	" You crib off my essays ; go on , you can admit it . "
tr	3	" A lot of the chaps don 't like him for that .
tr	1	" I think it 's about time to go back , Miriam .
tr	1	Mana began to pack the stone jug and picnic things in her basket .
tr	3	" I can use it to frighten the life out of the chaps ! "
tr	2	" Well -- you have to obey what she says , don 't you ?
tr	0	Mana was waiting with the basket , a neatly folded rug and her umbrella .
tr	0	" You can leave the jars and nets , " Simon said .
tr	4	Mana handed the items to him and walked over to the stone steps .
tr	2	He hissed , " No , of course we won 't look for shells .
tr	4	Do you know why they are there , or what purpose they have ? "
tr	4	Did they really change since the last time you saw them ? "
tr	2	Simon looked at him for a moment and dashed for the stairs .
tr	2	Mrs. Williams flung her dishtowel at him , and Nelly gave a shriek .
tr	2	Give me your cups , and go and do some work for a change .
tr	4	Armed with a duster , she began with Miriam 's new room .
tr	4	She went to close the door , but the large chest caught her eye .
tr	4	The heavy device made her stagger , but her curiosity got the better of her .
tr	4	Her heart thumped in her chest as she closeted the ball and left the room .
tr	1	" By not asking questions and doing what I 'm told , " Mana answered .
tr	1	" Our little ward , " Virgil added , swirling the liquid in his glass .
tr	0	Miriam sat down on a hard cushion as far from the stranger as possible .
tr	0	" Alas , my sister and I are alone in the world . "
tr	0	Theodosia looked at her in astonishment , and she gazed back at her guardian .
tr	2	I was going to ask you to play for us after dinner ! "
tr	0	The sun shone in through the window on her smooth black hair .
tr	2	Mana stood up and walked over to the window , beckoning for Miriam to follow .
tr	0	Miriam and Mana watched for a moment , but nothing else happened .
tr	1	Lunch was sent up , and Miriam thankfully put her pen down .
tr	0	Mana poured tea for herself and Miriam and put down the pot .
tr	3	" For the moment , I 'm content to stand back and watch .
tr	1	His back plainly said , ' Right , I 'm off . '
tr	3	" Listen , Miriam ; for the moment , forget about what we saw today .
tr	1	And if you find out what it is , will you leave ?
tr	0	" Very well , " Mana said , but Theodosia had already closed the door .
tr	4	He reverted to his usual bored attitude as his mother eyed him and Miriam suspiciously .
tr	2	Outside the schoolroom door , however , he lost a bit of his confidence .
tr	1	It was closed in a forbidding fashion , which made him hesitate .
tr	1	See what 's going on in the lessons , that is . "
tr	1	Well , nothing wrong with listening in to a lesson or two , is there ?
tr	2	Could always use some more information up there in the old noggin ! "
tr	1	" Miriam is almost finished her journal , aren 't you , Miriam ?
tr	0	And maybe after she has finished , we may all go for a walk . "
tr	4	" There is absolutely no need to discuss someone else 's parents .
tr	3	" Why not show them that story you 're writing , " Mana said .
tr	4	" When it comes to specimens , I 'm the king . "
tr	1	Virgil joined them in the dining room , just as they were sitting down .
tr	3	Furnace came in with the starter , and Theodosia turned to Simon .
tr	1	" I 'd like to learn how to fish , " Miriam said determinedly .
tr	0	" He talks a lot but he doesn 't say anything , " Miriam said .
tr	1	" I think Mother thinks he 's a bit of a ripping fellow . "
tr	3	" I laugh at her all the time , " Simon burst out .
tr	1	I bet it 's coming from your father 's income , Miriam . "
tr	0	" I 'm sorry you feel that way about your parents , " Mana said .
tr	0	" Above all , I can 't stand the way she treats Neil .
tr	1	Surprised , she responded , " It 's not so bad . "
tr	3	" Well , don 't think that I had anything to do with it ! "
tr	4	The colors set off her reddish hair and strange , dark orange eyes .
tr	2	" Oh , do say you will , " Theodosia said eagerly .
tr	0	You mean Barbara , " Miriam said , stressing the last word .
tr	1	They had only come into contact if Neil and Mana were in the vicinity .
tr	3	" You won 't start this kind of thing , will you ? "
tr	4	He never answers any questions , even though he talks and talks .
tr	1	Neil capitulated ; he obviously was dying to do a little spying .
tr	0	" Well , " Miriam said , " do what you can . "
tr	0	" Listen , about that girl , you know -- " " Barbara ? "
tr	1	Simon supplied quickly , putting down his razor and drying off his face .
tr	1	" Come on , " Neil said hurriedly , backing away and giving it up .
tr	1	" Now , back to that issue , " Virgil said determinedly .
tr	1	" I 'm afraid nothing would help me , " she said .
tr	4	She stole a glance at Neil , to see how he was taking it .
tr	4	He crossed his eyes at her and allowed one eyeball to swivel back and forth .
tr	0	Theodosia looked at Miriam and Neil with disapproval and shook her head .
tr	2	She could go and work on her dragonfly story , which was nearly finished .
tr	0	In the drawing room , a large silver pot was placed by Theodosia 's chair .
tr	1	" You look like an anxious curate , " Miriam said in his ear .
tr	3	Mr. Cantwell got up , dusted off his trousers , and looked at the cup .
tr	1	I 'll drink this one , Miriam , and we 'll ring for another . "
tr	4	I will , of course , pay for the carpet to be cleaned . "
tr	1	Uncle Virgil and Aunt Theodosia , would you mind if I retired now ?
tr	0	Valiant and Barbara , however , appeared as they always did : elegantly amused .
tr	1	Mana was sitting by the window , holding something in her hand .
tr	3	She turned it this way and that , studying the cup and she sniffed it .
tr	3	Did you , at any point , taste the coffee in this cup ?
tr	0	Mana put the cup in her lap and put both arms around her .
tr	0	" Of course you may , " Mana said , " in a minute .
tr	0	" But , Mana , " Miriam asked , " what does it all mean ?
tr	1	" I think so , " Miriam replied , taking another long slurp of tea .
tr	1	" Good morning , Neil , " Mana said , smiling at him .
tr	3	" I 'll write to them today , at any rate , " he said .
tr	1	He ran upstairs , calling for him , but no one answered .
tr	2	Grabbing a pullover , he dashed outside , still calling Neil 's name .
tr	1	Biting into it , he chewed thoughtfully , watched by Neil and Miriam .
tr	2	He stood up and marched to the steps , not looking back .
tr	0	She began to plan trips to the country for Barbara and Simon .
tr	0	" That would mean I would have to act like a young lady . "
tr	4	With him gone -- well , perhaps Miss Cantwell will find other interests . "
tr	0	Barbara stood in the doorway , one arm on the doorframe in an elegant attitude .
tr	2	" Good morning , " Miss Cantwell said , coming into the room .
tr	1	Barbara withdrew a fraction of an inch and smiled again in her most winning manner .
tr	0	Barbara stopped smiling , and she looked at Mana for a long moment .
tr	0	" Do you know , Miriam , you are right , " Mana said .
tr	1	You know I don 't want anyone else taking me in to dine .
tr	1	" But Simon , may I just tell you one thing in confidence ?
tr	3	" Oh , distasteful things , actions that we would really prefer not to take .
tr	2	Shocked , Simon asked , " How the devil did you know about that ? "
tr	3	She took his arm and nestled next to him for a brief instant .
tr	2	" Oh , darling Theo , I just couldn 't be more comfortable ! "
tr	0	" Aha , " Barbara said , sitting back as if satisfied .
tr	4	Simon exploded , unable to keep silent in the face of such snobbery .
tr	4	" Mother , you sound as if you were in the last century ! "
tr	0	Valiant put his cigar in one corner of his mouth and applauded .
tr	1	" I promise , " Barbara said , smiling at her brother .
tr	1	" I am going to take Miriam up to her dinner , " she said .
tr	1	" It 's my house , you idiotic , frightful ... ancient ! "
tr	2	" Now , you 're going to cooperate , aren 't you ?
tr	0	" She 's a girl , " he continued , staring at Valiant .
tr	0	" Your little suitor is actually becoming a man , Barbara ! "
tr	2	Don 't worry , Mr. Cantwell ; I 'll behave myself . "
tr	0	" Simon , " Barbara said , " do sit down . "
tr	2	She strode out and closed the door on Barbara 's soft laugh .
tr	0	For all the trouble it had caused , it was beautifully made .
tr	3	She got into bed and turned out the light but couldn 't fall asleep .
tr	2	Again , she found herself in front of a tall , iron door .
tr	2	She froze , but there was no sound at all coming out of the room .
tr	3	Miriam looked at it for a moment but couldn 't understand it .
tr	1	Quickly , quickly , she said to herself as she pulled on a dress .
tr	2	She crossed to her bed and took the comb out from under her pillow .
tr	0	There was a muttered exclamation , and a hand shot out and grabbed her wrist .
tr	1	" I think Mana 's leaving right now on the train , " Miriam said .
tr	2	" Just go back to bed and stop playing about , will you ?
tr	1	" I thought Mana might be hungry , " Miriam responded with injured dignity .
tr	1	" There 's no one here , " Simon said , glancing around .
tr	0	Its bright lights flashed , revealing the track ahead , and Miriam caught her breath .
tr	3	The whistle died down , and the train chugged into the station .
tr	1	And mind how you go ; they don 't want any interfering . "
tr	3	He extracted a short , stout bottle from an interior pocket and waved it about .
tr	4	" Can 't , " the voice said from the station , registering some regret .
tr	3	We 've got to deal with the mistaken goods on the Night Watchmen .
tr	0	What would Simon and Miriam think when they came back to an empty carriage ?
tr	0	The animal was probably not at all happy about taking such a steep descent .
tr	4	Neil pulled himself further into the bush as the cart drove away .
tr	1	he asked , licking dry lips and blinking in a befuddled manner .
tr	4	We promise we won 't go anywhere , don 't we , Simon ? "
tr	2	" Oh ho , so you admit that I 'm right now ! "
tr	3	" Maybe I didn 't strike the right tone , " he admitted .
tr	2	" Well , thank you for pointing out the obvious , " Simon said .
tr	2	Nelly padded downstairs and stopped on the landing by Miss Miriam 's room .
tr	4	She felt the same vibration now , a kind of movement in the air .
tr	4	Miriam 's bed was empty , and the girl was nowhere to be seen .
tr	0	Was it because of his extreme bravery and loyalty to Simon and Miriam ?
tr	0	After their disappearance was discovered , Simon 's parents would go on a rampage .
tr	0	Just as he had hoped , it contained a flat cake of ship 's biscuit .
tr	0	He managed to gnaw off a large bite , and he munched on it gladly .
tr	3	It was cold and wet , but it let him swallow the dry food .
tr	1	What a ridiculous position for the son of a fishing family to be in !
tr	3	His parents shouted at him to sit up and get a move on .
tr	4	Neil repeated his exhausted plea and tried to sit up but couldn 't .
tr	4	Did he see a long , pale shape , or two , beneath the surface ?
tr	0	He pitched forward and lay with his head on a rock , coughing and retching .
tr	4	Her bright , inquisitive eyes looked into his , and she nodded to herself .
tr	1	Neil pushed himself back and wiped his dripping mouth with one forearm .
tr	2	" Oh , " the older woman said , " of course .
tr	1	" She 's right , Miss , er , Mrs. , uh , madam .
tr	2	Tall , elegant pedestals held vases full of flowers and bowls of fruit .
tr	0	Neil couldn 't help staring at one particularly ripe mango , and his stomach contracted .
tr	1	I hope I 'm not -- " " You 're right , " Riki said .
tr	2	" Now sit down , Riki , do you hear me ? "
tr	0	Riki ran forward and began dipping her hand in the various plates .
tr	4	Privately , Neil agreed ; he was already tired of hearing the name Riki repeated .
tr	1	" Please stay with us for as long as you require . "
tr	1	" No , I must -- " A sudden , rattling yawn shook him .
tr	0	" Have a rest inside , and we can talk later , " she said .
tr	3	The thing twisted in the wind as she tried to shout to him .
tr	2	Obviously , halfway through the hairdo , Riki had grown bored of the braiding process .
tr	2	" Maybe I can do some work for you to repay you . "
tr	1	In an important manner , Riki added , " I found him on the beach .
tr	1	" But now , we cannot stand around and discuss this now .
tr	1	She burst suddenly into tears , pushed back her chair and ran from the room .
tr	1	" I 'm going to find my parrot and play with him . "
tr	1	I 'm like the prime exhibit in a zoo , Neil thought .
tr	1	" Sit down and I 'll show you , " Neil said .
tr	3	He 'd try to find out who that was and go to see him .
tr	2	Maybe you could be , you know , sort of a guide . "
tr	4	She considered this for a moment , and her face lit up .
tr	1	Neil added , " If that 's all right with you , sir ? "
tr	1	" If it 's all right with you , sir , of course . "
tr	4	she asked , and an unmistakable gleam of relief appeared in her eye .
tr	3	The truth is that Riki is a little much for me at times . "
tr	0	I 'm afraid our daughter takes advantage of my wife and the situation disgracefully . "
tr	4	" At least , he took over when the Company changed hands recently . "
tr	4	" We 'll probably get lost in the mountains and have to sleep outside ! "
tr	1	" I 'm very sorry , my dear , dear , dear Neil .
tr	2	He found her on top of an even larger outcropping of stones .
tr	3	" But I just can 't wait to catch a darling little crab ! "
tr	3	" I don 't want to talk about this anymore , " Neil stated .
tr	1	" Come on , finish your sandwich , and we 'll check our lines . "
tr	4	As he watched , she took the baby to a thick carpet in her garden .
tr	2	Riki darted back to him and pointed to a long outcropping of rocks .
tr	2	And there 's nothing you can do or say to stop me ! "
tr	4	They left the beach and made their way towards their goal , the large palace .
tr	2	There was the long veranda and the second story balcony on top of the porch .
tr	0	Riki began to climb up the slope , ascending as neatly as a goat .
tr	1	" Hard to tell , " Neil said , squinting into the fierce sun .
tr	1	Neil spoke with enthusiasm , and Riki looked at him , astonished .
tr	3	That man we saw in the tunnel , or whatever it is !
tr	4	A man ran up the hill behind them , and he looked extremely angry .
tr	2	Sweat ran down Neil 's face into the loose collar of his tunic .
tr	1	His glasses slid down his nose again , and he gave them an angry shove .
tr	1	Riki pushed him to one side and digging in the remains from lunch .
tr	0	You 're as bad as -- " " As bad as you ?
tr	0	" Not at all , " Riki said and cackled with wild laughter .
tr	4	He realized that she meant he was filthy and sorely needed a scrub .
tr	3	" But what my husband says is no more than the truth .
tr	1	When Riki was an infant , she didn 't stop crying for days .
tr	1	" Do -- not -- mention -- that -- name -- ever -- again ! "
tr	1	Grabbing his nose , he gasped , " What is that smell ? "
tr	4	Ignoring the shove , she whispered back , " Heard the row .
tr	1	And why wouldn 't he want anyone to help the poor thing ? "
tr	3	" Let 's go to the back garden and let them fight it out .
tr	0	She ran after him with sandwiches , or a hat , or something .
tr	1	" In truth , Mr. Neil , her recovery is very slow .
tr	4	It seems that each time she regresses , these spells last longer and longer . "
tr	1	" You 'd get bored with that in five minutes , " Neil said .
tr	2	" And maybe we 'll go fishing , " he added grandly .
tr	1	Riki didn 't say any more , and the silence yawned into the afternoon .
tr	3	If he could reach the mountain , he could start to investigate that tunnel .
tr	4	Once dressed , he crossed to the door and grasped the handle .
tr	2	He shook his head in a disgusted way and plopped down on the bed .
tr	2	Now you 're going to cry , or scream , or have hysterics or something .
tr	3	She stood with mouth open , staring at him , for a minute .
tr	4	The sun will be rising before we even get to the tunnel !
tr	0	Breathing as shallowly as possible , he waved the fan at the girl 's face .
tr	1	He wiped it with his apron and tried again , with the same result .
tr	1	" Oh , look , this is ridiculous , " Neil finally said .
tr	2	" This will come in handy for the -- you know . "
tr	4	She dropped her voice to a secretive growl on the last two words .
tr	4	Neil let her go and made for the front of the house .
tr	0	No , I 'm afraid I can 't allow that , Mr. Neil . "
tr	3	Remember that we 'll have to lug most of that up a mountain . "
tr	3	We don 't have to stay and talk to her , do we ? "
tr	2	He couldn 't wait in that locked room forever and not do something .
tr	4	Chapter 9 The Argument he jungle path seemed stranger and more mysterious at night .
tr	1	Gosh , Neil said to himself , and beside him , he heard Riki sigh .
tr	2	It raised one arm to its mouth , and a long puff of smoke followed .
tr	1	Some physicians are starting to suspect opium and laudanum of being dangerous drugs .
tr	4	A third shadow separated itself from the trees and glided over to the king .
tr	3	" But , Majesty , the worth of a nation is held in its people .
tr	0	" Come on , " she said , grabbing his arm again .
tr	0	And -- who was that first man , the one who had mentioned laudanum ?
tr	3	Besides , how will Old Meatball find out that we didn 't stay in there ?
tr	0	He wrapped it around the bag Riki had brought and tied both to his head .
tr	2	She shook him off and pointed , and Neil climbed out of the ooze .
tr	0	Behind him , he could hear the faint echo of the guards arguing .
tr	0	It was indeed an entrance to a cave , or at least a tunnel .
tr	0	As he did so he lost his grip on the torch , which plummeted downward .
tr	4	Its dying light showed that they were on the very edge of a huge cliff .
tr	0	Thank goodness he hadn 't let that precious bag fall as well .
tr	1	Suddenly furious , Neil yelled back , " Shut up , can 't you ?
tr	2	" I didn 't know if you could ever find me or not .
tr	2	" And I 'm so glad I 've found you , " he said .
tr	1	" Listen , Simon and Miriam were put on that train , I think .
tr	1	" Papers inscribed with our laws , " Riki said , interrupting .
tr	0	" Riki , I am very pleased to make your acquaintance , " Mana said .
tr	1	" I bet I could do it , " Riki said immediately .
tr	2	" I 'm going to throw some supplies down , " he called .
tr	0	A slim , brown hand curled around his ankle and stabilized him .
tr	2	Don 't look down , don 't look down , he repeated to himself .
tr	0	Thank goodness they didn 't have to crawl through the hideous swamp again .
tr	1	" Ha , ha , " Riki jeered , pointing at him .
tr	0	" I 'm going to fall asleep unless we start moving right away . "
tr	0	Riki always ate hers with about a pound of butter and guava jelly .
tr	4	" Maybe we can find some turtle 's eggs , " she continued .
tr	0	And what are we going to do , suck them raw ? "
tr	0	He thought she forgot her hunger as she lit up with her familiar enthusiasm .
tr	0	Riki clapped her hands , entranced with the thought of tricking her father .
tr	1	" Just don 't overdo it , " Neil warned with some misgivings .
tr	0	" That woman -- Mana -- said that you would tell me all about her .
tr	2	" Well , I 'm not really sure , " Neil said .
tr	1	Neil was just in time to see Riki disappear into a tumble of vines .
tr	1	Your glasses are covered with green spots , and your shirt smells . "
tr	2	" But why did you have to go fishing so early ? "
tr	4	The tall man bowed to Neil and went to kiss his wife 's cheek .
tr	4	The door suddenly opened , and everyone stopped talking as Riki walked in .
tr	2	He picked up his cup again and took a long slurp of coffee .
tr	2	A member of our royal family would never stoop to such a thing . "
tr	0	" I have heard of him , anyway , and his partner , Cantwell . "
tr	3	Neil spread out his hands , trying to calm the resultant uproar .
tr	2	" We will also help you , Neil , " he said .
tr	2	" I 'll be ever so good for ever so many months .
tr	3	Take that , you fat , gossiping old cow , Neil thought .
tr	2	I 'm going to wear green and gold with matching earrings . "
tr	1	Turning back to Neil and Riki , she snorted , " Maroon caftan , indeed !
tr	0	" Still , I want to go and rescue Mana as soon as we can .
tr	1	Neil , who sat as quietly as possible , nearly screamed with frustration .
tr	0	Neil leaned forward and took a slice of papaya from the dish .
tr	2	Which way did you say you took to return home , Riki ? "
tr	0	The chain dropped with a clank , and patiently the two began again .
tr	1	Riki hopped up and down with excited agony and gnawed on one nail .
tr	3	Please , he thought , looking out from the tunnel up at the stars .
tr	3	Neil nodded ; he felt that his heart was too full to say anything .
tr	1	I 'm dropping a knife -- make sure you catch it ! "
tr	1	Neil disengaged his hand from her grip and put his arm around her .
tr	0	Who would dare to treat a woman in such a way ! "
tr	4	" ' Very well , " she mumbled , and they headed for their rooms .
tr	2	" Look , why don 't you rest for a bit ? "
tr	2	You won 't do us any good if you 're exhausted . "
tr	4	" There 's some fruit and cheese on that table there . "
tr	0	" They must have found that Mana and the cage are gone . "
tr	3	I must say I didn 't expect them so - " " Hurry ! "
tr	0	" What do you think those are up in the sky , flying fish ?
tr	1	A sudden shout from the front garden brought him to his senses .
tr	1	His lips split in an unpleasant grin as he marched up to Riki and Neil .
tr	0	Neil frowned and walked over to the parrot 's cage and back again .
tr	4	She went to pick up the huge cage , but Neil stopped her .
tr	0	Machi shouted back , and the other guards all began yelling at once .
tr	2	You too , Riki , and close the door after you . "
tr	4	A medicine , but something to make you feel worse instead of better . "
tr	1	" So Simon 's parents are the ones who did all this ! "
tr	1	Neil nodded in agreement , trying to look as innocent as possible .
tr	4	" However , he and my daughter must go back to bed , now . "
tr	3	At some point during the night , the rains started up again .
tr	3	She took a deep breath and let it out in a gusty sigh .
tr	1	" Anything special we need to do , or say , or anything ? "
tr	0	They walked towards the temple , which was a small , squat building .
tr	2	He got down on all fours and peered into the dark pool .
tr	2	Now Neil could see a boy in a tiny , dirty room .
tr	2	Yes , it is tonight ; how odd that no one told you ! "
tr	0	Satin and lace , my dear , with a fan-shaped train . "
tr	2	" It 's too late for that , " someone said softly in the doorway .
tr	3	I just pray that you do not get punished too severely over it . "
tr	4	" Actually , I believe that I am now Queen , " she replied .
tr	4	At that moment , Neil could see the resemblance between her and Riki .
tr	2	" Wife , how did you get possession of those documents ? "
tr	1	Suddenly he got down on one knee and bent his head in front of her .
tr	2	" We 're going to be much too busy to think about treason .
tr	4	" I see now that she is much like my wife . "
tr	2	" The most important issue is : how do I look ? "
tr	0	A heavy wave of perfume overtook him , and he backed away with a cough .
tr	0	She 'll be splashed with mud from head to foot with this rain !
tr	2	I 'm going to file a complaint -- oh , look ! "
tr	4	" You give everyone a lot of entertainment , " it whispered .
tr	1	" I am a top hostess , if I do say so myself .
tr	0	There was a hiss from the imp , and a low laugh .
tr	1	More guards helped the guests alight by picking up fans and gloves and long skirts .
tr	3	They had been standing in a row by the steps , forgotten in the tumult .
tr	4	He took Machi 's spear and broke it over his own knee .
tr	1	It was as if the king had simply melted into thin air .
tr	0	" Oh , no , not that drafty , dreary hall , " Mana said .
tr	1	" I remember my father complaining about it when I was a child .
tr	4	" Heh heh , " Riki cackled , and she nudged Neil with one elbow .
tr	1	I hope he 's going to help us save Miriam and Simon .
tr	1	Riki nudged him again , but Neil felt too pleased to mind .
tr	1	And I promise I 'll come back soon -- Riki , wait ! "
tr	3	He tried to smile back at her , but found that he couldn 't .
tr	0	He looked away and strained his ears for any sounds from another carriage .
tr	4	It could even be the conductor who had refused to listen to him earlier .
tr	0	Naturally , we 'll be sent back to my parents right away . "
tr	2	Simon opened his mouth again , but he obviously decided not to reply .
tr	4	" You 're on your way to Devil 's Kitchen , sure as eggs . "
tr	2	" No idea , but it doesn 't sound too promising . "
tr	2	Couldn 't I just show you how to fancy a girl in my time ?
tr	2	" On your feet , you lot , " he said to the prisoners .
tr	0	" Have a nice stay , " the guard said as Miriam passed him .
tr	1	He continued in this vein , and Miriam could feel Simon get warmer with aggravation .
tr	0	The sky overhead was dark with clouds , and it had started to rain .
tr	3	The building in front of them was surrounded by stone that was dark as slate .
tr	1	Frank immediately said to the man behind him , " Oy , watch it ! "
tr	3	I 'm certain that the authorities are on a hunt for us now . "
tr	3	" Just listen to him for a moment -- it 's the truth ! "
tr	4	The Headmaster suddenly stopped her and made her turn to face another door .
tr	0	Instantly , a woman appeared from a door in the opposite wall .
tr	0	Miriam started forward and asked , " Are you from the Island ?
tr	4	The woman looked up for a moment , but she shielded her eyes .
tr	1	One was counting a mass of folded , gray shirts on some shelves .
tr	4	Miriam stretched out her hand , covered with greasy suds from the heavy soap .
tr	1	Headmistress 'll have our hides if she sees such a thing . "
tr	0	" Oh , give her the silly thing , Dora , do .
tr	3	She and Oh No made another left turn to more steps that went straight down .
tr	2	Oh No brought her to the only open door and pointed inside .
tr	0	Large paintings hung on the walls , portraits of foreign royalty next to large landscapes .
tr	2	She pressed him back and blew on the spoonful to cool it .
tr	3	" Just get your strength back now , and we can talk more later .
tr	0	His voice was a bit garbled , so he cleared his throat and asked again .
tr	3	They took her into that dreadful factory , the Devil 's Kitchen .
tr	1	" Why don 't you just call me Nurse , " she said .
tr	3	Simon tottered to one of the windows and brushed away the curtain .
tr	3	He tried to open the window , but the catch would not move .
tr	4	And since when have you become so mysterious , old friend ? "
tr	3	What is this secret you can 't tell your best friend ? "
tr	4	Several have claimed to have seen him but can offer no proof .
tr	3	But that would have to wait ; there was still the roof to finish .
tr	3	They started back up and in just another turn their task would be finished .
tr	0	Well , who among us hasn 't had such thoughts , he chuckled .
tr	3	The land was too rich , the scents too crisp and clean to concentrate .
tr	1	I was wondering if I might have a few minutes of your time . "
tr	2	You live down by the low hills , do you not ? "
tr	2	" You were just a boy the last I spoke to you .
tr	1	The fire was beginning to die and the night airs were invading the cabin .
tr	4	It is seldom I have the chance to recount my old tales to anyone .
tr	2	Nothing like a fine meal to work up a good conversation . "
tr	4	He saw movement and looked hard straining to see through the mists covering the fields .
tr	3	You must be tired , and maybe just a little hungry ? "
tr	4	He was not in the habit of hearing himself addressed in that manner .
tr	3	It was just one of Mr. Clancy 's peculiarities he would discover throughout the night .
tr	4	The vegetables were crisp and fresh , but they too were different .
tr	3	They had gardens that grew special plants during the short summers of the north .
tr	1	I can guess your thoughts but I assure you , you have nothing to fear .
tr	3	The fire was warm with a soft glow as they all settled in .
tr	4	Please , I am not in the custom of being addressed as ' Mr. ' .
tr	3	They deposited their load next to the hearth and took their seats .
tr	0	He walked slowly back to the large chair made of strange wood and sat down .
tr	1	" Many have I seen on the roads and in the night sky , Clancy .
tr	2	I will not bother you to remember that which you know so well .
tr	3	If that is true , he must return to the Kingdom of Snow . "
tr	0	" You speak of strange things and of strange places , Mr. Clancy .
tr	0	Clancy opened the cupboard and took out a leather-wrapped package and climbed back down .
tr	1	" Now my friends , this is not something to be careless with .
tr	1	Satisfied this was not some strange wizard 's brew , he took a sip .
tr	1	His eyes lit like fire and with sudden approval , took a drink .
tr	4	The barrels themselves were of a special type of wood to help develop the flavor .
tr	3	" Now is the time we must turn our tales to more serious talk . "
tr	2	What special bird is this and how do you know of its song ? "
tr	1	The Northern Kingdom and the Kingdom of Snow are one in the same .
tr	4	In his mind he had blotted everyone else in the room out of existence .
tr	4	I believe he does not think I search for an ordinary rock .
tr	1	" The crystal has power untold when in connection with the cane .
tr	4	To them those tales are now only legends , myths now not to be believed .
tr	4	They are the most vile of creatures that live upon the soil .
tr	1	If I am not successful , I fear all hope is lost . "
tr	1	" I do not believe I am quite up to it this morning . "
tr	3	With that settled they gathered the few items they had with them and set out .
tr	2	Other than his cloak , Mr. Clancy took only a small pouch .
tr	3	" We may take the straight south route , if you like .
tr	3	They talked casually among themselves on various topics , nothing more than idle chitchat .
tr	2	He looked to his right and saw a light come through a low window .
tr	3	" In a way yes , though that tale is not completely lost .
tr	4	Could he possibly believe this story , this tale from someone he had met ?
tr	1	The sun was climbing quickly as they had trudged on for nearly another full turn .
tr	1	My unannounced passage through your land may well unsettle more than folks in your realm .
tr	1	They moved off the main dirt road into the low brush ringing the surrounding fields .
tr	3	From there they would take a path south , away from the population .
tr	2	" The two of you should hang your shirts on those low branches .
tr	3	It will then be just a short journey to my cabin . "
tr	1	Staying in one place too long was generally not to his liking .
tr	0	It was the largest hawk they could have imagined and it was heading south .
tr	1	My quest is my own and I will force it upon no living being . "
tr	0	It takes more than a handful of black creatures to ward me off . "
tr	3	The most difficult choice they had ever made was what crop to plant .
tr	2	" I will follow you ... " " As will I. . . " "
tr	3	Though conversation was light they did not dwell on the events of the day .
tr	3	They are a loose collection of tribes that band together for mutual gain .
tr	1	They serve only the dark forces and dark lords of this world . "
tr	4	If black creatures are in the Dream Valley , they may be elsewhere .
tr	2	They walked down the last low hill and into the valley proper .
tr	2	I plotted our course as we made our way through the South Hills .
tr	1	In this wilderness the night was as dark as a bottomless well .
tr	4	Any light could signal their presence so they camped without a fire .
tr	4	The sun came softly over the eastern mountains as the company stirred and made ready .
tr	4	When you lay at night you may see events which could come to pass .
tr	0	They reached the hills within a half turn and raced through a deep trough .
tr	4	They reached the ledge in ten minutes , though it seemed more like ten turns .
tr	3	I do not wish to spend another turn with this in me . "
tr	3	You must drive it fully through my shoulder lest the point remain in .
tr	4	Keep an eye on him ; he should not roll in his sleep .
tr	2	He saw it , moving slowly , looking down as if he had lost something .
tr	2	" I never meant for harm to come to any of you fine folk . "
tr	3	I have yet to decide on the matter beyond that point . "
tr	3	He had left them by the stream to scout the lay of the land .
tr	0	It was a habit he had learned in the early days of his travels .
tr	0	Clancy awoke but stayed seated , adjusting himself against the hard rock .
tr	0	He is more than just a man ; he is also a hawk .
tr	4	There were new things to consider ; things both strange and true .
tr	2	Clancy took two steps forward , his hands locked together resting on his stomach .
tr	3	Each generation that undertakes this quest must pledge his undying oath to the king .
tr	2	There is much to do this day and a long way to go . "
tr	4	Some have great healing powers as those that I picked from the crossroads . "
tr	0	You saw his wound ; you pushed the arrow through his skin . "
tr	2	" Do not let the sight of no hole fool you , my friend .
tr	3	They started down the rocks , the sun now climbing high toward the noon sky .
tr	0	He crawled inside pushing past the damp , flaking bark and was soon asleep .
tr	1	" How will we go on with him in this condition ? "
tr	4	" Wake now , dear friend , the time is at hand .
tr	3	Then at last he heard a soft stirring , then an echo .
tr	0	The company was off in a sprint as quickly as Clancy cleared his hiding place .
tr	3	" But Mr. Clancy ... " " Do not argue with me .
tr	1	He will return if it is in his power to do so . "
tr	4	" You have mentioned your king many times yet have not told us his name .
tr	1	Mr. Clancy and I must confess , we can go no further . "
tr	2	" What to look for I cannot say , for I have no idea .
tr	2	" All I can say is , you must look to the south . "
tr	2	" A fine tool for foraging , or a weapon , if need be . "
tr	3	An outline in the grounds below though I cannot tell the shape of it . "
tr	3	It began just below them at the foothills on which they stood .
tr	2	It is you that have come where you do not belong . "
tr	4	They made their way to the southern edge of the small plateau .
tr	2	The evil that has come to this land is now looking for you . "
tr	4	" They are waiting below ; you have revealed yourself to them . "
tr	2	" You will stand down to me or I will rip out your worthless throat !
tr	3	It is you that let him get away , not me . "
tr	4	It is as if the vines themselves are fleeing the valley . "
tr	4	" I hope it is not one that has been made in haste .
tr	0	He was now sure ; their ways were as strange as he had always heard .
tr	4	Did he have it or was he stopped by the black creatures ?
tr	4	They each took a place on the ground near the low brush .
tr	3	" This is the ... " His head turned again to the stone .
tr	2	It was different now , somehow , though he could not say why .
tr	1	A brilliant light leaped out cloaking his face in a soft white glow .
tr	3	He remained still , not pulling away , fixed to that spot .
tr	2	It serves those who would do good in the face of evil . "
tr	0	I did not know what was happening to me , but I was not afraid .
tr	2	" I am so sorry , I lost my grip on your cloak .
tr	4	They moved slowly at first careful to keep their presence a secret .
tr	3	Then something stirred within , an emotion he had not felt to this point .
tr	4	They froze in place , their eyes scanning the terrain for movement .
tr	4	He lowered his head into his hands and wiped his face in silence .
tr	3	I thought you were ... " " Fortunately , I was not . "
tr	1	Just as quickly the power that was in this man 's soul shone through .
tr	1	" Dawn will be upon us in only minutes , " Clancy said .
tr	2	Out of my way or you will die where you stand ! "
tr	2	Though not cold its body heat had been sapped into the cool ground .
tr	0	The crack was heard throughout the rolling hills in the silence of the predawn night .
tr	3	He watched silently as the great hunter was quickly lost from sight .
tr	3	He dismissed that thought and turned to the others asleep on the ground .
tr	3	The brush soon gave way to short , fat stumps of thick trees .
tr	2	He fell , his head crashing to the ground , bouncing off a rotten log .
tr	3	They had walked more than a full turn and it was now time to rest .
tr	2	A black creature landed on top of him , its foul odor filling his nostrils .
tr	2	Again , the lower foothills would seem to hold the most promise .
tr	3	It would be difficult to climb but easy to defend if it came to that .
tr	3	" It is always my intention to stay out of trouble , Mr. Clancy . "
tr	2	" And what young boy do you know of this not to be true ? "
tr	2	" I heard something , though I could not make out the words . "
tr	1	I do not intend to stay awake longer than I need . "
tr	3	Now , he had not the strength to throw a rock from this ledge .
tr	2	He stood there waving his flag for a good five minutes but to no avail .
tr	4	The second creature flew high circling the other as it rose , then dove .
tr	2	We will be no more and the northern realms will fall into war . "
tr	4	I do not know why we were not seen crossing the lower stretches . "
tr	4	Remember the song tells it can be seen from a high point .
tr	0	It was as a vulture , large and black that circled the murky skies .
tr	4	He has seen the power of the crystal and it is growing in him .
tr	2	I do not know its full power or what it may do to him . "
tr	4	They cleaned their campsite scattering the ashes from their earlier fire to the winds .
tr	0	They sat back and led from the rear as cowards will always do .
tr	2	With all their powers they still could fall to the edge of a sharp sword .
tr	0	He arrived at his tent where a guard was standing at the open flap .
tr	2	The day will come slug , and he will trouble us no more . "
tr	2	Now go and do as he says , or he will kill you . "
tr	1	His forces spread out in all directions advancing in an arc moving north .
tr	3	What would those pitiful things do if they were to find them ?
tr	2	They were not good soldiers only cowardly spies and of little use to him .
tr	3	They stood in place straining to hear , what , they did not know .
tr	0	I hear nothing , only the sound of the wind through the branches . "
tr	2	" They will most certainly pillage all around them , " Mr. Clancy answered .
tr	4	It is something I would not have expected from you after all these years .
tr	3	It was time to rest , their backs and limbs tired from the long march .
tr	2	A lot of good this will do me , he thought as his mind raced .
tr	2	" You have not introduced our friends , have you Clancy ? "
tr	1	" There is much to discuss Clancy , let us talk over breakfast .
tr	1	" I think we will risk a small fire , just enough to cook by .
tr	0	Breakfast was quickly made and just as quickly finished , the meal small but satisfying .
tr	3	The morning meal being finished they turned their attentions to the matters at hand .
tr	1	It was a land now scorched beyond recognition , burned and trampled .
tr	2	The sun rose and splashed the lower valley with long , brilliant streaks of light .
tr	4	But in the meantime we must be on our guard as before . "
tr	4	They had reached the northern edge of this extension of the mountains .
tr	2	I will not be able to spy small patrols in the deep shadows .
tr	2	" I see no evidence of victory on your part , fool .
tr	4	We have swept through the lands of our enemies and crushed their homeland . "
tr	2	You pitiful fools have marched an army of wolves through a land of sheep .
tr	4	He knew the land where the others did not , the trails and pitfalls .
tr	2	The others looked across a rolling field through a narrow band of trees .
tr	2	" Something moved , dropped from sight beyond the second hill into the low spot .
tr	2	They had come too far , struggled too long to back away .
tr	0	His house was torn and burned , his fields raped ; he had nothing .
tr	0	What could he have here that would be useful to us , he thought ?
tr	1	" Open it and you shall likely see that which is familiar . "
tr	4	I do not believe Clancy would part with these of his own free will .
tr	2	I ask you again , how did you come by these ? "
tr	4	" Whatever the reason , I am most grateful for your sudden recollection . "
tr	4	" We have gathered all the remaining food and clothing we could manage .
tr	0	The word was dutifully obeyed and the small company gathered what they had salvaged .
tr	2	Unable to come to any certain conclusions stubbornly drove the thoughts from his mind .
tr	4	He called a halt to the march knowing a brief respite would do them well .
tr	4	" You my friend are left with the sword of the Eastern Kingdom . "
tr	3	His two companions watched impatiently , annoyed to still be up this late at night .
tr	1	I do not relish being kept away from my own tent and my own bunk .
tr	2	" How do you propose we find this , ' searcher ' ?
tr	2	Yours will also accompany mine and someone else will command your armies . "
tr	2	He wanted to do something other than simply walk along looking at the ground .
tr	0	The bright sun lit their way through the shadows deep in the woods .
tr	4	If we are indeed being followed we should remove ourselves from sight .
tr	1	Darkness will arrive shortly ; it will be our best cover . "
tr	3	The guards reappeared minutes later at attention , their backs ramrod straight .
tr	0	Finally , red-faced and sweating hard , he slumped to his chair .
tr	4	Half of them will take the western range , the others the eastern . "
tr	1	Many had been found , torn and mutilated , often beyond recognition .
tr	0	" You have had counsel with him many times , have you not ? "
tr	2	Only the people of the kingdom and outsiders are brought forth in this fashion .
tr	0	He could reach out with his mind somehow seeing all that was about them .
tr	3	They plotted out the course as best as they could from this vantage point .
tr	4	It would be different for him here on the mountain 's face .
tr	3	The company would have little time to search and no time to bury him .
tr	1	I do not think there will be anyone trying to observe us on the mountain .
tr	2	If one would fall there was no solid object for any of them to grab .
tr	4	It had been a long time since he had done anything like this .
tr	4	He was sweating profusely under the strain , as were they all .
tr	3	" I do not think that is what he means , Clancy . "
tr	4	After a few minutes he was able to regain his composure and follow the others .
tr	0	The final hundred yards had taken longer than a full turn to traverse .
tr	0	Each hit the rocks across the gap and scrambled up onto a small plateau .
tr	2	We could not have chosen a more opportune time to begin this crossing .
tr	2	Now be off with you , I have work to do . "
tr	4	He , and only he would deliver any news of the company he was tracking .
tr	3	Clancy looked up to the summit that was now in full view .
tr	1	We must hurry on if we are to make this pass successful .
tr	3	They felt almost at peace but it was now time to move on .
tr	0	Again , the fire was buried and all traces of their encampment brushed away .
tr	1	We young ones should still listen to our elders , I suppose . "
tr	2	After all , he had chided them long enough about their youthful outlook on life .
tr	4	" Keep walking with me but clear your mind and close your eyes .
tr	4	As he walked he cleared his mind to the openness that was around them .
tr	1	" Wait then to see if it passes again , passes low .
tr	0	The giant hawk swung around and then climbed high in the bright sky .
tr	2	" Too bad , he would have been good for the stomach .
tr	0	The effort was too much to bear and again he faded away .
tr	0	Again the pain was too much to absorb and he fell away to darkness .
tr	2	He was racing not for his own life but for that of another .
tr	3	The sun had passed its midpoint more than a full turn past .
tr	1	Surely the others could not carry on with his charge against such odds as these .
tr	1	The branches suddenly began moving bouncing back and forth on top of him .
tr	2	They could little afford to call out , as any sound could reveal their position .
tr	4	Then , after a few moments , they heard him trotting across the lower ledge .
tr	0	It was hard on the body , and hard on the spirit as well .
tr	0	They stopped for perhaps half a turn at midday for a short meal .
tr	0	The only way was to make a dash for the forest , and hope .
tr	3	They would not stay in the hills ; they could not risk the openness .
tr	2	This land they all knew and with luck , it would also serve them well .
tr	3	They kept together as best they could , though it was difficult .
tr	3	It surged out from the center and cut a wide arc across their path .
tr	4	If only he were here he could soar above the light and spy for us .
tr	2	He would have to pass this piece of information on to the others .
tr	4	If they were charged they would not have any chance to either fight or flee .
tr	1	" His business is our business but this is not the place or the time .
tr	2	My apologies sir , I would not dare to confront a wizard such as yourself .
tr	2	This ebook may not be re-sold or given away to other people .
tr	0	In the German states , in Austria , and throughout France , anger was brewing .
tr	1	Logan was a Viscount and I a commoner , only his friend .
tr	0	I smiled over at Logan and gave a chipper " Shall we ? "
tr	2	" You do know how to make a scene , don 't you Nathaniel ? "
tr	0	I bowed playfully and jumped back as his kick cut through the air .
tr	2	It seemed that this voyage would involve a lot of monotonous travel .
tr	2	And of course , Logan and I took to the city manically .
tr	0	Logan and I were to be abroad for at least a year , perhaps longer .
tr	4	With the price of bread so high , we can barely eat . "
tr	1	He ran to a window , leaning out and sucking in the fresh air .
tr	1	" Logan , you and your family are nothing like these kings .
tr	1	" You 're not a noble , " he said , not unkindly .
tr	2	I looked down and felt sick , but our carriage kept rolling .
tr	3	The French started it years ago , but rich bastards like us put them down .
tr	1	" It 's not the same in England as in France , " I countered .
tr	1	" Ah , pure , definite planning ... ' change something . ' "
tr	4	He folded his hands and set a bowler hat next to my wine .
tr	1	Inset into the medal was a Christian cross , bisecting the diamond 's angles .
tr	2	It 's in your blood , and it 's your duty . "
tr	2	Not a sound carried throughout the room ; all conversation had stopped .
tr	4	The minute the other man spoke , the location of their accents came to me .
tr	3	It 'll be pistols , traditional form , at sunset tomorrow , " I said .
tr	2	We set a location and departed from each other 's company without another word .
tr	1	* * * * * I found my friend lounging about in our lodgings .
tr	3	He tossed the bottle towards me , oblivious and forgetting to cork it first .
tr	3	Then , taking a long pull , I swallowed the drink without tasting .
tr	4	He didn 't appear nervous , but I couldn 't be certain .
tr	4	For centuries , men had been killing each other in a tradition to recover honor .
tr	2	You 'll bring my body home and let them know , won 't you ? "
tr	0	Our carriage clipped up dirt and gravel as its wheels cascaded down the worn path .
tr	2	I retreated from my friend and took up a cautious position next to our carriage .
tr	1	The other second stood by me , his arms crossed across his chest .
tr	2	Logan was crouching amid the grass , and the doctor stood above him .
tr	0	As he twitched about , I prepared another weapon and passed it to Logan .
tr	1	I kept my gaze steady on Logan , ignoring the countdown and Fuchs .
tr	4	Fuchs ' second lumbered forward as well , and I checked my urge to follow .
tr	2	I stood and ambled about the room , searching for yet another bottle .
tr	4	" Besides , I don 't think weapons will be needed . "
tr	4	" Just be thankful for now , and maybe we 'll discover everything later . "
tr	4	Together , we hauled our trunks down the stairs and deposited them upon the landing .
tr	3	Figures jumped out of the waiting coach and crept towards the building .
tr	3	We 'd left the massive things at the foot of the stairs .
tr	2	Ducking through various alleyways and backstreets , we paused to take stock of our position .
tr	3	" What 's a Grand Tour without a bit of adventure ? "
tr	4	Of course , the cloaked men had been seeking us at our lodgings .
tr	2	Would we need to travel from city to city , watching over our shoulders ?
tr	1	When I mentioned it , Logan mirrored my thoughts but raised a valid point .
tr	3	Or second , they might try to find us at the train station .
tr	3	" There won 't be a train to Rome at this time of night .
tr	3	They 'll have the entire night to set up any ambush they want . "
tr	1	I pointed towards a public placard listing certain train times , and our luck held .
tr	4	The last few passengers ducked aboard , and still , we remained .
tr	4	Sucking in one last breath , we dashed , all the world like champion athletes .
tr	1	Throwing ourselves up the platform , we hurtled towards our departing train .
tr	0	It seemed as private a compartment as any , so Logan followed .
tr	1	Unless my sight was very much mistaken , that was Fuchs ' second . "
tr	4	" Then let 's pray to God they don 't receive one . "
tr	3	At that moment , a harsh , humorless chuckle filled the compartment .
tr	0	Staring up at him from my seat , it was clear that he was tall .
tr	2	You don 't need to hear some dandy drabble on about his own woes .
tr	0	This American had a charming way about him , despite his sad words .
tr	0	My father inherited a bit of land from my grandfather and about a dozen slaves .
tr	0	On the other hand , I am , well , rather bookish . "
tr	3	He continually nags about the need to actually accomplish something with my life .
tr	2	Pledging this , I left home , and told my family very little .
tr	3	Women don 't act like that , ' she said nervously but firmly .
tr	2	I fell incredibly , madly , hotly , passionately in love with her .
tr	1	In horror , I looked at him to see if I had misheard .
tr	0	I know within my soul that I 'd have shot him had I the chance .
tr	1	Lilly Porter died in my arms that night , and I died too .
tr	1	Lilly 's waiting , but I cannot bring myself to take my own life .
tr	4	" The sales from my books have left me the fortune I wanted .
tr	4	Perhaps those men might take offense to Fuchs ' death as well .
tr	1	Blinding snow whipped around us as the train heaved itself up the mountain .
tr	3	I would never forget the cold , majestic wonder that waited amongst those stone giants .
tr	1	But , I think what we saw in Paris will be here too . "
tr	1	Through all of this Jacob waited , a vein marking the pulse in his neck .
tr	1	" In England perhaps , but not in France and certainly not in Rome .
tr	2	When the two of you return home maybe you could work towards something there ? "
tr	2	I followed him onto the platform , my own limbs tired and unresponsive .
tr	3	" That does seem the most likely culprit , doesn 't it ?
tr	4	They 've been most accommodating in keeping track of your travels thus far . "
tr	4	As with Paris , we couldn 't help but notice the squalor some lived in .
tr	4	We were , for the moment , about as poor as them .
tr	0	Aside from some petty cash , none of us had any anything of value .
tr	0	He simply wrapped his great girth around Logan in a warm , fatherly embrace .
tr	1	I offered my own bow in return and wrung the man 's beefy hand .
tr	1	Like you and William , Logan and I have been friends since childhood .
tr	2	I was honored to accompany my companion and ensure he stays out of trouble . "
tr	0	Jacob started at the sound , while Logan and I laughed at the spectacle .
tr	1	Many carried platters of fresh fruit , pitchers of cooled water and luxurious wines .
tr	1	Noting my insistent glance , he launched into our tale of woe .
tr	3	Your visit took me by such surprise that I quite forgot about it . "
tr	3	We made to stand , but the man motioned us back into our seats .
tr	2	In fact , I would be most honored to continue to serve as your host .
tr	0	" For Nathaniel and I , sadly no , " said Logan .
tr	3	I 'll send some of my staff to fetch it right away .
tr	4	He was welcoming , and the three of us accepted the offer .
tr	4	Finally , we arrived back at the home , exhausted but content and entertained .
tr	1	" For a ruined family , this is still pretty impressive . "
tr	1	The majority of his bulk was hidden amidst folds of fine orange fabric .
tr	1	We did , our feet carrying us through the throng of party-goers .
tr	2	A voice cried , loud enough to cut through the many conversations .
tr	4	" New Orleans would have masked dances around Carnival , but they rarely interested me .
tr	2	Maybe I acted too soon ; this looks like it 'll be marvelous ! "
tr	3	Suddenly , without fanfare or introduction , the orchestra launched into a lively waltz .
tr	3	What good was it to be amid beauty if one didn 't participate ?
tr	0	" And what fair country do you hail from , my lady ?
tr	4	There was no malice in her voice , and we all became instantly enchanted .
tr	0	To his subjects , King Martin is practically regarded as a saint nowadays . "
tr	1	" Rome is ... Rome is nice , but it is not home . "
tr	4	However , she quickly gave up and returned her gaze to me .
tr	0	With a wink towards Alexandra and a shove towards me , he separated us .
tr	0	Unfortunately I was standing alone and awkwardly , most dancers already paired for the movement .
tr	0	Their music soared through us , and the dance took my breath away .
tr	3	It was almost as if a fraternal instinct overtook me at that exact moment .
tr	2	As the Vivaldi work faded into a quiet resolution , our own pace slowed .
tr	3	" More than lived up to that reputation , I 'd say .
tr	2	" My lady , I would love to see your country someday .
tr	1	Perhaps on our return to England , we may arrange travel through Germany . "
tr	4	I chuckled at Di Luca 's obvious overindulgence and waited for my friend to answer .
tr	4	All told , we had been the butt of the whole ordeal .
tr	2	Marcellus ' glass had frozen , the cognac nearly to his lips but now forgotten .
tr	4	There we were , chatting along , and they 're gone . "
tr	2	Next , the two of you 'll be -- " " Oh come off it .
tr	4	If it 's no inconvenience , we 'll simply retire for the evening . "
tr	3	Without waiting for another protest , we turned and began walking towards the exit .
tr	2	Masked faces continued to swirl about us in a maelstrom of color and hue .
tr	3	That prevented the common riffraff from getting in their way , at least in theory .
tr	0	As the carriage started away from the manor , Logan leaned forward .
tr	4	" Regardless , we 'll certainly be able to visit their household should we choose .
tr	4	" The driver knows his trade and these roads a lot better than we do .
tr	1	The man sat back , nodding , but he didn 't look convinced .
tr	2	" And isn 't a duel for honor supposed to be an honorable occasion ? "
tr	4	The fingers were a child 's , even darker than his own , blackened by dirt .
tr	0	Another boy was sprawled face-up in the ditch , face bloodied and swollen , unmistakably dead .
tr	0	She pushed the hat back into position as a low moan came from the back seat .
tr	4	Despite the rough ride , Noah was looking content , emerald green eyes glinting in the moonlight .
tr	4	Plus , there weren 't really a lot of surfers in Ohio , where Noah was from .
tr	2	" I can never get over how lucky you are , " Noah was going on .
tr	2	A waist-high cluster of boulders overlooking the valley below turned out to be the best option for privacy .
tr	0	She did have on a warm cardigan over the lacy white blouse Quechua ladies always wore .
tr	2	How could these women 's sons , and boys from other communities too , just be gone ?
tr	1	Noah was running up the hill panting , with a hundred screaming Quechua kids close on his heels .
tr	2	Still lying low , he pulled a small gray cell phone from his pocket and punched a button .
tr	3	The white orb of midday sun still blazed through the murky haze of pollution over the city .
tr	0	Gabriel was the skinny , fair-skinned guy who could make something from anything , a regular MacGyver .
tr	1	And yes , Stalin 's parents , student revolutionaries , had actually named their infant son Stalin Lenin Gomez .
tr	0	Cochabamba was sunny and bustling , infused with a rainbow of flowers and the smell of smog .
tr	0	Tiago was a guy of maybe nineteen with a boyish smile and black baggy jeans with chains .
tr	0	Rudolf had a very clean-shaven German jaw and wore a preppy gray sweater and dark jeans .
tr	1	If Noah wasn 't in danger of being picked up , this would actually be kind of fun .
tr	4	" That 's right , " she snapped , facing the other guys and then meeting Noah 's eyes .
tr	0	She kissed him , and maybe it was the shock , but Noah didn 't pull away .
tr	4	She jerked her head around to look at him , still not quite meeting his eye .
tr	3	" I 'll take you home , send the guys a text that they can sing without me .
tr	1	During high school back in Bolivia , the girls were more interested in his whiter , richer friends .
tr	4	" I don 't think I do have more questions , " Alejo narrowed his eyes at Stalin .
tr	2	We both know you love to be right , and I 'm giving this one to you .
tr	0	" And that means you can 't be a Muslim anymore , " Stalin conceded glumly .
tr	4	" They 're telling us they know where our families are , " he stated the obvious .
tr	3	" I thought we might have to drag your butt out of bed , " he chuckled .
tr	3	The Pashtun guards leapt out of the car , weapons gripped tightly in their rough hands .
tr	0	" You all stay here and guard the car , " Ishmael instructed his guards and driver .
tr	4	A thin plume of smoke snaked from the chimney of the building into the slate gray of the sky .
tr	1	This mission was a dream come true , a gigantic victory in the cause of justice .
tr	4	Several of the men 's blackened , bare feet twitched only a few inches away from the food .
tr	3	Hard work , but today I get a reminder that in the end it all pays off .
tr	4	People accused Bolivians of always being tardy to everything , but really , they had no idea .
tr	1	He understood the reasons , but sometimes really wished his boss didn 't have to pay him in cash .
tr	0	Thank God he had nothing in his wallet to identify him as a Westerner , as usual .
tr	0	A skidding bus anywhere near the edge of this mountain road was ample cause for alarm .
tr	3	" The Road of Death , living up to its name , " a woman muttered .
tr	4	Noah was wearing khaki shorts with leather hiking sandals , and his tanned legs were covered in powdery dirt .
tr	0	He wore a turtleneck , as he had every day since the attack in Pakistan a month ago .
tr	0	She about had a heart attack when you called her and told her about the skiing accident in France .
tr	0	The caf wouldn 't have any business without his brownies , anyway , so it was a logical choice .
tr	0	Salazar and anyone with the power to do anything were constantly scratching each others ' backs .
tr	4	" Sounds great , but there 's always the possibility of more people being onsite besides just the speaker .
tr	0	Alejo slowly slid down against the trunk of the sleek banana plant and buried his face into his arms .
tr	2	I didn 't know you two were together or I could have warned you about her .
tr	3	" That 's a chartered bus that some group is going back to La Paz in tonight .
tr	0	Noah asked him , trying not to appear crazed and breathless after so much running around .
tr	2	" That 's fine , " Noah said , willing to shell out the few dollars more .
tr	4	" Right now , " the man said , though no one else seemed to be around .
tr	4	A group of well-dressed people , laughing together in muted tones , passed him , headed towards the bus .
tr	0	She glanced at him for a millisecond and saw that his jaw was squared , eyes stormy .
tr	2	" So one night , " she mumbled , " I had too much to drink . "
tr	1	She had him buy it in Bolivia , because it was cheaper than in Puerto Rico .
tr	3	I just ran away from him , because it was easier to just not think about it .
tr	4	God could forgive , but how could he ever feel same about her , seeing what she had done ?
tr	2	Noah shot her a lopsided smile and murmured to himself , " You 're doing this all wrong . "
tr	4	This ring is something I got in Egypt when I studied there for a semester when I was twenty .
tr	1	Noah hauled himself out of his scrunched up position in the aisle , laughing but looking stricken .
tr	3	She tried to grab on to something , but it was like a nightmare catapult flung her into space .
tr	4	" Two questions : Is he dead , and does it look like an accident ? "
tr	2	The girl was on the point of tears , looking all around , trying to find something .
tr	1	A chorus of complaints arose around him , which he ignored , turning towards Gabriel with a wink .
tr	3	In the light of the tent 's lamp , Alejo took in his captive 's dusty jeans and sweater .
tr	1	With tan skin and light brown eyes , she didn 't look like the typical North American girl .
tr	0	He threw up until there was nothing left , then wiped his chin on his t-shirt .
tr	1	Alejo sank down onto the ground with a clear view of his tent , still feeling sick and undone .
tr	4	If he helped the girl leave this place alive , he would have to leave the Prism .
tr	0	There was always a price to pay , he 'd learned , for doing what was right .
tr	1	Paulo pressed his lips together and folded his arms across his chest , looking even more dangerous .
tr	2	I 'm going to do the best I can to think up a solution for this , ok ?
tr	4	Sorrow gripped her chest like a vise and she let herself sink back into the sleeping bag .
tr	4	She twisted the silver ring on her finger , feeling she was really in a dream .
tr	3	Noah had stretched his legs out under the table and was back typing furiously at his little tablet .
tr	1	And Islam gives us a common cause as brothers : fight against injustice and Western Imperialism .
tr	2	And they are not too happy with me right now , as I 'm sure I told you before .
tr	2	Paulo lowered himself onto the floor next to her and held out one hand , palm up .
tr	4	" I know women take a long time , but we really have to get back . "
tr	0	Standing next to Stalin stood a tanned figure , jaw hanging open as he gaped at her and Alejo .
tr	0	An arm caught her around the shoulders , yanking her back up to standing as Alejo released her .
tr	4	Evil lights flashed in front of her eyes , and she wanted to pass out , die , anything .
tr	1	She absently realized the salty stuff dripping across her lips was blood and that her nose was probably broken .
tr	1	They pushed quite a ways into the forest , ducking under hanging tree fronds and circling giant banana plants .
tr	0	She shrugged away from him and began to pick her way carefully through the tangled mass of plants .
tr	0	And in the distance , a spacious , cleared area with dirt tracks down the center : a runway .
tr	1	The balding man took her hand carefully instead and held it , frowning back at Alejo in concern .
tr	4	I 'll bring her something new back from the market in Cochabamba when I come . "
tr	0	I asked the guy downstairs to have a taxi sent over with some anti-inflammatories from the pharmacy .
tr	1	Alejo felt his fists clench hard at his sides , the words hitting him like a load of bricks .
tr	0	How could he explain who he was , when his family had not known him for fourteen years ?
tr	0	I was a leader , and the punishment for leaving is death for my family . "
tr	1	And now I show up , a Muslim , a criminal , who has ruined their lives .
tr	2	He turned towards his mother and held out a hand towards her , then dropped it to his side .
tr	4	His voice was even and low , but Alejo noticed a bead of sweat riding his father 's forehead .
tr	0	" Franco Salazar was on the bus , heading back to La Paz , " Alejo managed .
tr	3	Alejo felt sick , not at all ready to get into a discussion of the past with his father .
tr	3	Now , unfortunately , we 've got to talk about getting you all out of here .
tr	0	His father looked dazed , then asked , " So this was all about Franco Salazar ? "
tr	1	Alejo remained silent , removing his gaze from his mother and sister and folding his arms across his chest .
tr	2	I 'll get out of your way so you can take care of your family . "
tr	4	The zombie-like expression in her eyes , along with her lack of protest , actually worried him .
tr	0	She was lying here in a hostel room with the man who tried to kill her and Noah .
tr	0	" On my last trip there , Ishmael took me to the Tribal Area near Afghanistan .
tr	2	All she could come up with was , " Why did you have to kill us ? "
tr	0	He was also a child molester , and ran the largest child pornography ring in Bolivia and Paraguay . "
tr	0	Her father told her last night , because Salazar came up when he was talking with Alejo . "
tr	3	" He thinks it would be good for you all to try to go to the United States .
tr	0	Alejo 's family all stared at him with expressions of disbelief that clearly said : Go ?
tr	0	They are going to call your family right away and confirm that you are alive and well . "
tr	3	They won 't check passports at the border , since they don 't look like tourists .
tr	4	She could go home , see her parents , find a new place to live and work ?
tr	2	Alejo looked at her sharply , mouth open as if about to protest but she cut him off .
tr	0	" Thank you , " was all she finally said , fighting hard not to cry .
tr	4	He actually looked rather normal now in dark jeans , a hunter green hoodie , and leather tennis shoes .
tr	4	And underneath , a giant closed gate painted the color of red hot candies with an enormous pink heart .
tr	2	If the guys from my team would come here , no one has got our ID .
tr	4	The plush heart bobbed around wildly as he turned the key to Motel Room Number Six .
tr	4	The faded sheets were still drifting lazily on the line in the afternoon breeze on the hostel rooftop .
tr	1	if you are going to continue being a criminal , because that really complicates our relationship . "
tr	0	She had Noah 's ring , and she knew that he had wanted to be with her .
tr	1	Mrs. Hearst 's lip curled with anger and she yanked her arm out of his grip .
tr	2	Many people went up front to talk about Noah , including the Bolivian pastor of Noah 's church .
tr	0	He thought about what his father had said back at the Hostal Salta : Noah would have forgiven you .
tr	1	The phone started ringing again , only seconds after it stopped , and it was annoying as heck .
tr	4	When the caller rang a third time , then a fourth , Alejo 's adrenaline picked up .
tr	2	Alejo moved in a crouch towards a plate window overlooking the quiet cobblestone street in front of the house .
tr	4	Here , let me move a little bit , there , ok , do you see me ? "
tr	4	His eyes flickered as if trying to read Alejo 's expression , and then he sighed .
tr	4	The fields were empty and seemingly overgrown and abandoned ; no uniformed guard waited near the gate .
tr	2	Alejo was peering out the window , looking for any sign of the rest of his team .
tr	2	Alejo sighed and put one hand on the door , really anxious to get out of the car .
tr	2	Alejo tapped his foot compulsively against the floor of the truck , waiting for Gabriel to park .
tr	4	He heard Gabriel yank the key out of the ignition and saw him reach for the door .
tr	3	In a little while , I 'm going to have to take this truck out again .
tr	1	Stalin and Benjamin were standing behind the truck , weapons obviously loaded and pointed casually in Alejo 's direction .
tr	0	Alejo saw Benjamin shake his head , face unreadable as usual , hand pointing the gun steady .
tr	2	You 're an idiot to do this to us , you know that , che ? "
tr	1	" I just didn 't think it was right to kill her when God obviously let her survive .
tr	3	" In my life I have seen so much betrayal , so many that I could not trust .
tr	2	All I did was try to take the girl away so you wouldn 't kill her .
tr	2	So then , even now , we could talk , we could find a way to bring you back .
tr	0	Stalin looked up at the sky , as if in defeat , and Benjamin shook his head .
tr	0	Say the word , and I 'll take you back again , to be one of us .
tr	2	Alejo looked back at him for a moment and then loudly said , " No . "
tr	4	They had left him there on his stomach , eyes staring at her in the darkness .
tr	0	We 're going to drop him and you and get away as fast as we can .
tr	3	They said you were on the bus as well , that bus that had the accident .
tr	2	I can 't talk about Noah , or I 'm going to throw myself into her arms and cry .
tr	1	And if I cannot come , I will remember to pray for your friend at church . "
tr	0	Alejo had stopped shaking and lay flat on the bed , face the color of white clay .
tr	3	He added two tiny spoons of sugar and a stream of cream , stirring it around without thinking .
tr	4	No one else was here besides Gabriel , and that fact was beginning to make Gabriel sweat .
tr	4	A good example was the people of Palestine , where his grandparents had lived before immigrating to Bolivia .
tr	0	When he wasn 't studying , he made a small amount of cash playing at concerts and parties .
tr	4	Alejo heard the clatter of ceramic on the table and turned towards her , expression pained .
tr	4	She cut her eyes over to Alejo , whose lips had condensed into a grim , pale line .
tr	1	29 turquoise THE BUS STATION WAS PACKED , a writhing mass of bodies and battered suitcases .
tr	0	" A woman , an old Quechua woman , came here an hour ago , to pray for me .
tr	4	They were both dressed in cheap clothes and black rubber flip flops with a healthy coating of dry mud .
tr	3	No one tried to stop them as they passed through the hospital gate and onto the dimly lit street .
tr	2	This room was filled with light , blazing from a small chandelier formed from deer antlers .
tr	1	" If you decide to stay awhile , in the morning I could give you a tour .
tr	2	But for now , my job is to make sure you aren 't spooked and run away .
tr	3	I know things are a little up in the air right now , to say the least .
tr	0	Now in my dream , I understood exactly what he was talking about : the Death Road bus accident .
tr	2	You 've broken Bolivian law and , I assume , have people from your organization after you .
tr	2	Come with me , both of you ; there 's something I have to show you . "
tr	4	They waited in silence at the back of the office , arms crossed in front of their chests .
tr	2	" I know about this video from my brother who works at the American embassy , Robert .
tr	2	Thus , they fight in the cause of Allah , willing to kill and get killed .
tr	2	I 'll be waiting for all you guys , so please don 't disappoint me , ok ? "
tr	4	Her jet black hair was tied back in a messy ponytail , dark circles under her eyes .
tr	2	" Would you be at all shocked if I told you my parents were missionaries in Morocco ?
tr	2	So , would you be at all shocked if I told you I 'm a pastor 's son ? "
tr	2	I 'm sure you wouldn 't be shocked if I told you I used to be CIA .
tr	1	He now knew about Rupert 's past : missionary kid from Morocco , CIA , three failed marriages .
tr	0	Another red plaid thermos was in his other hand , which he held out towards Alejo .
tr	3	" The time is coming to ask all your questions , but I want you to work with me .
tr	3	" Not to be forgiven by God , but to make things right and restore what you have destroyed .
tr	0	And you can try to give back what you took away : the man that she loved . "
tr	4	But I 'm 100 % sure she would never accept , not if she knows I 'm here .
tr	0	All I meant was that we should talk with her about CI and see what she says . "
tr	3	Then Alejo would come back here to the ostrich farm to stay for the time until their exploratory trip .
tr	4	Rupert was grinning , as if he and Alejo were in the middle of a joke .
tr	2	Then she noticed him crouching on the floor in front of her , head bowed towards the floor .
tr	3	They sat there staring at each other for a few minutes , letting the moment sink in .
tr	3	As to the destination of the trip , Rupert had kept silence , not even wanting to hint .
tr	4	" We would have been a pretty pair , both lying there with holes in our heads .
tr	2	In one section , he found books with titles such as " A New You in Forty Days ! "
tr	1	proclaimed one book with the image of a slick Hispanic man in an expensive purple suit .
tr	2	" Don 't worry ; this carpet is so worn no one will ever notice . "
tr	2	" Daddy 's waiting for me at home now , so I 've really got to go . "
tr	3	He wore tattered cotton pants , stained from the floor of his cell , and a simple white t-shirt .
tr	1	None of Sami 's family had any intentions of burying their wayward relative in the Christian manner .
tr	0	She cradled the Taylor across her lap and began to pick her way through a few chords .
tr	4	And I , uh , thought I could see where you live , maybe meet your parents . "
tr	3	She eyed him sideways , but he just sat there with that Zen-like tranquility , meditating on nature .
tr	2	" I don 't think you 'll turn down the chance to give me a few good kicks . "
tr	0	But now Alejo was coming at her again , ready to take a swing at her head .
tr	2	" I 'll show you how to do this hold I 've got your arms in .
tr	2	I shivered uncontrollably now and shook out each hand to " knock " some warmth back into them .
tr	1	I remember saying in my mind , but again , I didn 't say " crap " .
tr	2	I was now become increasingly worried I wasn 't going to be able to hold on much longer .
tr	3	Up till that moment , I hadn 't realized the amount of snow that had been falling .
tr	3	At some point out on that cliff , the snow increased in intensity from heavy to savage .
tr	2	I looked up and saw the next wall of snow roiling as it charged down the snow slope .
tr	2	I looked over to Isaac and he was now looking at a rock wall behind us .
tr	1	For those who don 't know what an ice axe is , it is a miniature pick axe .
tr	4	Undaunted , I decided to use the pick of my ice axes to try to climb higher .
tr	0	This was scary climbing , with a PF ( pucker factor ) of about an 8 .
tr	4	A few feet higher , it appeared that the texture became more blocky and easier to climb .
tr	2	PF = 10 I reached up and scraped off some snow above me , looking for a good placement .
tr	0	I lost my breath as I frantically searched with my feat for any type of purchase .
tr	2	I fought hard for my position , but was no match for the forces of nature .
tr	0	Isaac jumped to the ground and burrowed in as quickly as he could , but it was too late .
tr	1	The wave of snow rolled into him , knocking him backward and dragging him down the mountain .
tr	1	Like a man swimming through mighty river rapids , Isaac flailed his arms and nudged his knees higher .
tr	0	PS : Years later , my friend Isaac , tangled with another avalanche while climbing alone .
tr	0	Bet you can 't catch ' em all , " Trae said , with a challenging smirk .
tr	3	The old Buick was literally parked at the stop sign for what now felt like an eternity .
tr	3	With little time to react , Trae sprang to his feet and hurried toward his sister .
tr	1	She knew something was wrong , but was too young and naive to fully understand Trae 's actions .
tr	4	Suddenly , he realized they both were alive and had made it through the drive-by shooting .
tr	0	In an instant , he slammed on his brakes and brought the old Buick to a quick halt .
tr	2	Trae rolled to his side and dropped down onto the deck of the porch once more .
tr	3	With both victims down , the four thugs ran back to the waiting car and sped off .
tr	4	In a moment of solemn respect , he uttered a few simple words , " Forgive me Lena .
tr	4	Most of the boys in blue would be lucky , and escape the wild and harried volleys of lead .
tr	3	Blood and bone splattered the two cannons in a characteristically horrific pattern of death and destruction .
tr	4	Although the projectiles embedded in the earth and exploded , their destructive intention would not be denied .
tr	4	They grabbed their poles even harder and strained to push the tiny raft faster down river .
tr	3	Struggling to stay afloat with the weight of the rifle , he kicked his boots wildly under the water .
tr	1	His world had changed in an instant , the graphic vision imprinted in his memory forever .
tr	4	As fear enveloped him further , he quickly crawled around the deceased soldier and continued on his path .
tr	4	As he crawled , the elevation dropped off slightly , allowing him more protection from the bullets passing above .
tr	3	Fletcher had the gravest injury , he motioned to the two privates to carry him to the operating table .
tr	4	Immediately , the two lifted the gurney out of the ambulance and over to the other wagon .
tr	3	With the strap wrapping around the leg , he pulled hard to tighten the cloth band around the skin .
tr	3	" Sir , why don 't we cut right down to the bone on the first pass ?
tr	4	As he was instructed , Asst. Fowler pulled back the freshly sliced muscle as the doctor worked quickly .
tr	2	Working quickly to overcome the numbers , Dr. Morgan set up another operating wagon for Asst. Fowler .
tr	1	Pulling her mask from her face , she anxiously reported , " Doctors , you 'd better hurry .
tr	4	Dr. Stadler inserted the probe into the incision and began to suck out the excess blood .
tr	0	Clean out as much of that fecal matter as possible , " Dr. Warner cautioned as Dr. Stadler worked .
tr	4	While Dr. Warner worked to repair the damaged spleen , Dr. Stadler answered Nurse Edward 's question .
tr	0	As they both worked frantically to repair the damaged organs , the flow of blood went on nearly unabated .
tr	3	" She taking blood faster than we can give it , " she retorted back instantly .
tr	0	With his gloved hands dripping fresh blood onto the floor , he hung his head low .
tr	4	In a blurred and confused state , he was unable to hear his name being called as he walked .
tr	0	He looked back up the hallway to Nurse Edwards , who was calling his name , but heard nothing .
tr	2	As if in slow motion , he stepped in and the doors slowly closed behind him .
tr	2	He too wore a bloody smock , and his face also carried the expression of pride .
tr	3	At the bottom of the panel , a circular button labeled " G " was highlighted .
tr	2	" Are you just going to stand there or are you going to help me ? "
tr	4	He suddenly heard the deafening sounds of thunder and recognized the foul stench of rotting flesh .
tr	0	David said out loud , as a wave of fear and confusion spread through his body .
tr	1	Now , if you will indulge me a while , I 'd like to see your abilities .
tr	0	" Doctor , I can assure you my skills as a surgeon are more than adequate .
tr	3	Without the basic equipment to understand the patient 's vital signs , David could only make limited observations .
tr	2	David recalled from his courses in school that the anesthesia of choice during this period was chloroform .
tr	4	" We 'd amputate , but then he 'd be no worse off than if we had amputated now .
tr	3	With the help of the old doctor , the patient was anesthetized in a matter of minutes .
tr	3	" Ok , doctor : as you can see , the patient 's leg is torn up pretty badly .
tr	1	Again , he rinsed out the interior of the wound with ' moonshine ' and his makeshift saline solution .
tr	0	A few minutes later , as the patient was gaining consciousness , David had tied the last bandage .
tr	0	All books are available on Smashwords for $ 2.99 or $ .99 as well as in paperback form .
tr	1	I walked around the building looking for an entrance and finally found one at the walk-out basement level .
tr	3	Anyway , I didn 't think this was the way I had entered the first time .
tr	1	I cut in line behind a woman with a skirt the size of my uncle 's pole barn .
tr	3	It lasted a full minute -- sixty microwave seconds -- and I felt hotter and hotter .
tr	0	When I looked up again I realized that the lady had just said something about a case .
tr	1	Suddenly there was a boom of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in sheets .
tr	2	Miss Jackson led me to a high , rocky bluff and we crouched down and looked over .
tr	2	It 's not a good idea to look down before you 're still far enough to break a bone .
tr	0	The language we heard coming from the steamboat and the raft was really , really old fashioned .
tr	4	My cousin has some really nasty rap stuff he let my brother and me listen to .
tr	3	Still , I got myself out of the tangle of the ropes and gave it my best shot .
tr	4	Suddenly both girls froze as they heard a rustling in the underbrush twenty or thirty feet below them .
tr	2	But it was pushing outward and Missy had nowhere to step to from her crouching position .
tr	2	Missy was losing her balance even though the door was no longer pushing outward only upward .
tr	2	" Yup , don 't you want to know who we 're going to see ? "
tr	4	" Not exactly , " Missy said and then saw the disappointed look on her mother 's face .
tr	0	Early Saturday morning they ate breakfast and packed sandwiches and drinks for a picnic along the way .
tr	3	She was so completely lost in thought that she didn 't even notice it had started to snow .
tr	4	Her mother laughed and said , " I should have checked the weather report for up here .
tr	2	Suddenly it all slid off and revealed a startling truth : Welcome to Starkville , population 125 .
tr	0	He had two hearing aids that were half hidden by a fringe of silver gray hair .
tr	0	The top of his head was bald but he had a long gray beard and no mustache .
tr	4	He had been a big man once but now he was a little bit stooped over .
tr	0	She had learned that her great-grandfather and great-grandmother had built Big Pine Lodge sixty years ago .
tr	0	I always thought that maybe he had an old girlfriend by that name but I never asked . "
tr	4	It wasn 't ten seconds before a boy in a red jacket and jeans appeared at the door .
tr	4	Mr. Stark introduced him as Kevin Jackson whose parents he employed as the lodge 's managers and general caretakers .
tr	2	He handed it to Kevin who nodded and turned to go out the door without waiting for Missy .
tr	3	" I 'm sorry , " she said but he just smiled and started to walk toward the lodge .
tr	3	Should she ask him if he was the one at the little fort spying at them ?
tr	3	" We live past the last cabin , through the woods , and in back of the stables .
tr	3	The stable is empty now , just some old tack and stuff in there and junk . "
tr	1	" That 's not all it hides , " Kevin said with a little smirk on his face .
tr	3	Looking up they could see that they would have a big problem getting into the attic .
tr	4	She wasn 't sure if she went up she would be able to get back down .
tr	3	That light is coming in where the lamp on the wall is at the first landing .
tr	3	I 'll go up this way and open the trap door ladder from the attic . "
tr	4	She could hear his footsteps above her and then the attic door swung open and the ladder came down .
tr	0	It was a lot easier to climb than the spiral stairs and she scampered up them easily .
tr	3	She put everything back except the muskrat coat and turned her attention to the other trunk .
tr	3	As she patted it down to fit into the trunk she felt something hard in the hem .
tr	2	Kevin got up from the floor where he was looking through a box marked comic books .
tr	3	Just then they could hear that clanging sound made by the triangle on Mr. Stark 's porch .
tr	1	Missy didn 't know what to say so she just waved and said , " See ya . "
tr	2	" But I 've got to warn you , I 've forgotten how to open it .
tr	2	But you have to work in the kitchen some mornings and help the maids , too .
tr	2	She found a book on antiques that showed many beautiful examples but no clues on how to open them .
tr	4	She carefully returned all of the articles to the puzzle box and closed the side hatch .
tr	0	They both were silent for a while as each wished that she could talk with him now .
tr	3	Missy put everything back into the box and closed it up just as they exited the highway .
tr	3	He had so much to say he rattled it out faster than they could hear it all .
tr	4	He and Missy had run ahead of Mr. Stark and were at the base of the tree .
tr	0	He was on his way back down now and Missy was eager to try it out .
tr	3	That way she could step out onto the fort above and check it out , too .
tr	1	The second car bounced along with its windows open and four boys laughing and cursing inside .
tr	1	Kevin scolded Missy , " You shouldn 't have moved , Missy , they couldn 't see us .
tr	2	Rob had his license last summer and now it looks like Dave does , too . "
tr	4	" I didn 't tell them because Dave said he 'd get me if I did . "
tr	3	Missy thought about that for a minute and glanced back out the little window toward the road .
tr	1	" Okay , " Missy said , " I think I 've got them straight . "
tr	3	" Down the hatch , you two , " Ricky said , gesturing toward the trap door .
tr	0	Chapter 2 A large black bear waded across a shallow stream a mile northeast of Big Pine Lodge .
tr	2	Ricky and Lonnie laughed loudly and made a point of stomping out of the cottage and slamming the door .
tr	4	" They 're gone , " Kevin said , " but their stupid brothers are down here .
tr	3	" We 'll say it was the first one , the one that old Mr. Stark lives in .
tr	4	Dave held the lighter high and illuminated the little reflectors that Mr. Jackson had recently posted .
tr	3	With that thought he jiggled it a bit and figured it was at least half full .
tr	0	He was kind of glad that he was wasting Rob 's lighter and not his own .
tr	4	When there was no more glow from the others ' lighter Kevin switched on the flashlight .
tr	1	" You go first , Rob , " he said , unwilling to give up the lighter .
tr	4	he shouted and then tripped on some loose gravel and sprawled headlong on the cave floor .
tr	3	The left tunnel was a maze of interconnecting routes that looped around without any other exit .
tr	4	The tunnel up and out was a couple of feet above the floor of the cavern .
tr	1	Behind him the curtain fell back into place , quivering a little before settling back into its stillness .
tr	3	He almost stuck it back in his pocket then decided to wait until it cooled a bit first .
tr	3	" I 'm pretty sure they 'd have to come back this way to get out .
tr	3	" I may be wrong , " he said , " but I think they took the right passage .
tr	0	" Okay , " Lonnie swatted at a mosquito , " I know what we can say .
tr	2	Missy peeked out of the playroom door and found the lobby empty , another bit of luck for them .
tr	3	When the patch was thoroughly destroyed they found some soft earth and started digging for grubs .
tr	3	She felt the tug when it lost all of its slack and began to pull the stove .
tr	0	" He was probably the one you said was so mean , the one that was driving the car .
tr	1	" Look at this little whip , " he said and started flicking Ricky with it .
tr	1	Off in the distance they heard a bang and started thinking about guns and hunting and deer and pheasant .
tr	4	Misty was the tallest horse , totally black except for a white mark between his eyes .
tr	1	Lonnie and Ricky had heard the kids talking in the corral and spied around the corner on them .
tr	1	She was scared , but not as much as before because this stable was her responsibility .
tr	4	It seemed that all four of them were going to pretend that the trapping incident never happened .
tr	4	He mounted the horse then realized he 'd have to ask one of them to untie the reins .
tr	0	He could see Missy having a hard time reining in Misty who probably wanted to gallop away .
tr	1	Johnny stayed on his tail with Lonnie gripping the saddle horn and the horse 's mane .
tr	4	Little Blackie was just as spooked and he chased after the others with Ricky clinging like a monkey .
tr	2	Lonnie 's stirrups were too short and he 'd lost hold of one of the reins .
tr	4	Kevin and Keno zigzagged until they rounded the last bend and opened up speed on the wide straightaway .
tr	4	Lonnie and Ricky silently agreed but they weren 't about to join her in her contempt .
tr	3	They sat down at a small table next to their moms who were halfway through their lunches .
tr	4	They both laughed , finished their food , picked up their beach bags and headed out .
tr	3	They wouldn 't change their gait into a canter unless instructed to do so by their riders .
tr	0	At last they reached the area where Dave and Rob had attacked them and the trail narrowed .
tr	0	Ricky was afraid the same thing would happen to him so he was extra careful as he dismounted .
tr	4	He didn 't let go of the saddle until he was certain his legs would hold him .
tr	2	It took Missy and Kevin a half an hour to get all four horses rubbed down .
tr	1	Missy was glad for Kevin 's help since she usually had to do it all by herself .
tr	4	Now they managed the place and were in the process of buying it from Missy 's great-grandfather .
tr	2	Nobody tomorrow , of course , since it 's Sunday , but Monday and Tuesday are full .
tr	1	I was already thinking of typing up a form people would have to sign releasing us from liability . "
tr	3	" That means so they can 't sue us if they fall off and get hurt .
tr	2	They both stood up blocking the boys from getting a closer look at the bikini-clad blondes .
tr	1	" Hi , I 'm Lonnie , " he said , " and this is Ricky .
tr	4	Missy guided a newly married couple on the trails and into the state forest and back .
tr	0	Angela had skipped dinner to go out with the other maids to a pizza place twenty miles away .
tr	2	" Your mother gave me this to give to you if you ever got sick or sad . "
tr	0	Kevin was fascinated by fire and Mr. Stark used to call him " Sparky " when he was smaller .
tr	4	He couldn 't tell , but they were chuckling about it and moving sideways , away from her .
tr	3	It would be incredibly stupid of them to repeat that , especially at the first campfire .
tr	3	That was strange , she thought , because now they 'd be last to get any .
tr	4	One by one each person crumbled up his or her empty newspaper cone and tossed it into the bonfire .
tr	4	They came out of the path near the back of the lodge and looked around for their brothers .
tr	0	Straight ahead the moon was now reflecting off the lake which was as still as a mirror .
tr	3	Ricky got up , rolled his blanket up and the two of them started out the door .
tr	1	This book is the third in the series and is available in paperback and digital format .
tr	3	Tommy still couldn 't see anyone other than the hairy arms magically coming out of thin air .
tr	0	Their hands slipped apart and incredibly Noelle was sucked through the air with a whoosh and disappeared .
tr	2	He circled around to stand behind the spot and reached up and down and patted the air .
tr	4	Tommy had started at chest level , but now the hole seemed to be higher up .
tr	0	Along side of the garage Grandma had planted a patch of tomatoes and beans and cucumbers .
tr	3	Billy hadn 't discovered the attic yet and Tommy wasn 't about to tip him off .
tr	0	It was a room of extra furniture and keepsakes , books , games , and toys .
tr	0	He looked down and saw chalk marks , the beginnings of that stupid hopscotch game that girls played .
tr	0	He had noticed how his dad and his uncles still threw a few punches at each other .
tr	0	They laughed again and Tommy recognized it as the sound he had heard a block away .
tr	1	" I 'll just put this in my room , " he said , indicating the bag of candy .
tr	3	It was just chiming the first of the four notes it always rang on the quarter hour .
tr	4	He had the strange feeling that he had been here before and he knew the way home .
tr	3	He unwrapped a stick and rolled it into a ball before putting it into his mouth .
tr	3	Tommy stood frozen to the spot as the beast sniffed at the gum wrapper and intermittently roared .
tr	4	He passed over the pink coin and the old woman gave him two blue coins from her pocket .
tr	2	He bit off a tiny portion and rolled it around on his tongue before chewing it up .
tr	1	He drank down the cool refreshing fluid in mighty gulps , following it with a satisfied belch .
tr	3	The bottom of the stick was dessert , sort of like a peach cobbler with a crunchy sugary crust .
tr	3	" I 'm sorry , " Tommy stuttered , " I just wanted to ask you for help . "
tr	3	She turned away from him and took two steps to a large cauldron that was tipped on its side .
tr	2	Tommy slumped his shoulders and tried to look pathetic , hoping she would take pity on him .
tr	4	He jumped up and threw his leg up over the limb , nimbly climbing the new tree .
tr	3	There was no going left or right around the mammoth rock without leaving the safety of the path .
tr	4	He looked back down at the blue landscape below and thought how fuzzy the things in the distance seemed .
tr	3	But the path was veering to the right and would soon disappear into a forest of blue .
tr	4	He sometimes had to crawl or climb over and under limbs in the way of the trail .
tr	0	Ahead of him he saw a flock of small birds darting from tree to tree singing madly .
tr	3	When he did Tommy was stunned to find that the path split into two sets of forks .
tr	3	He couldn 't throw the torches all the way to the middle anymore ; it was too far .
tr	3	Tommy didn 't want to lie though he wasn 't sure telling the truth would help him .
tr	3	That 's silly , Tommy thought , but he obeyed anyway and took a deep breath .
tr	2	But Tommy politely bowed , too , and said , " Pleased to meet you . "
tr	3	A winding path took them past several strange fountains that looked like prehistoric animals spitting up .
tr	1	Tommy kept close behind the Prince while still trying to take in all of his surroundings .
tr	3	Then the tall barn door opened , but only at the bottom , like a pet door .
tr	0	This is what happened : It was Saturday and we were having our annual school fair .
tr	2	Our school backs up to a humongous woods and that woods borders a marshland and another state forest .
tr	4	The fourth-grade teacher , Mrs. Buckley , caught us once and we missed a week of recess .
tr	2	I told Austin and Sydney and Callie about the hobos and then I would yell , " Hobo ! "
tr	1	I once saw him scrape white bird droppings off a fence post with his fingernail and sniff it .
tr	4	I swear I could see lines of scent waving back from her like in a cartoon .
tr	3	Something big , something not human , something with just two toes was out there in the darkening forest .
tr	4	Up and around , looking everywhere , eyes and heads moving in every direction at once .
tr	2	Like know when the car was going north or east without looking at the compass on the dashboard .
tr	4	I wasted absolutely no time at all in refocusing my single-minded quest for the way out of these woods .
tr	3	There was nothing stinky to the left so that was going to be our new path .
tr	1	I could imagine all their arm and leg hairs popping out straight with goose pimply fright .
tr	1	After you 're around her for a while you start to understand her grunts and growls .
tr	4	His energy is all jumpy and exhausted , muddled blue with too much brown mixed in .
tr	2	Bringer of little chills all up and down me , mostly when he isn 't trying .
tr	3	I lug my shoulder bag down the university 's cobbled pathway toward the student union building .
tr	0	He is a striking man , tall and pale with thick , dark hair cut short .
tr	3	* * * That night I work on a short story for my creative writing class .
tr	0	It 's about a little girl who lives in an orphanage and discovers a magic crayon .
tr	4	Her drawings come to life on the page , so she creates herself a perfect family .
tr	1	" Come on Pixie Girl , " Ryan says closing his big , boring and utterly practical textbook .
tr	1	Avalon is the product of a reckless idealism that can only blossom in our naïve university seclusion .
tr	0	He murmurs an apology , and I only catch a glimpse of wavy hair tamed with a ball cap .
tr	4	" We can 't both be boring , " I tease back and bite his nose .
tr	1	I 've won a full smile from him , fading quick , stirring those chills inside me .
tr	3	At first I think he might be a college professor or a lost parent , but no .
tr	3	He is not so tall , but I can tell that he is a powerful person .
tr	1	His voice is quiet and calm , each word crisp like water drops hitting my cheeks .
tr	3	A light flickers on , and I tuck my head to my chest to protect my eyes .
tr	0	" It is a shame , " he says , " that they are always born human . "
tr	2	The word comes out of his mouth softly but with obvious pleasure , " food . "
tr	4	Even as I struggle up , he is next to me , pushing me down , hard .
tr	4	" Once the change is complete , you will require sustenance , " the man says .
tr	2	" I 'm nobody 's daughter , " I say , which is only sort of true .
tr	0	The sound is raw , spiraling up into a squeal that cracks and dies in my throat .
tr	0	I fall back onto the cot , and the scream has taken away my last reserves .
tr	2	The angel moved swiftly in front of his prey , crouching low , ready for a fight .
tr	1	Using roundhouse and 180 ° spin kicks of death , Gabe knocked the creature down , stunning him .
tr	3	No , let me tell it ... Of course he 's going to say that ... .
tr	3	The driver doesn 't say anything , but the color ratchets around him , bright along the edges .
tr	2	I close my eyes , but I can still feel the skin pulling away from my palms again .
tr	2	The amber glow is so bright around him that it looks like some sort of unnatural fire .
tr	3	They act as if they can 't hear the music flowing in hot torrents all around us .
tr	1	Until she does , she 's an innocent , and we don 't kill innocent people .
tr	3	I turn my head to gaze at the headboard , at the initials scratched in the wood .
tr	4	When I get back and you 're feeling a little better , we 'll explain everything .
tr	0	I know that probably doesn 't mean much , but ... " Gabe kneads the visor of his cap .
tr	2	More accurately , my gaze moves around his body , following the flow of his energy .
tr	2	" Are you ... " I swallow and concentrate on the words " ... my brothers ? "
tr	2	When you 're done with the animal , you 'll want more , but you must stop yourself .
tr	0	He holds a small border collie puppy under one arm and clutches a plastic bag in his other hand .
tr	2	" I 'm going to cut the cuffs off you now , " he says to me .
tr	1	" She 's got it , " Gabe says under his breath even as he lifts his gun .
tr	3	A new set of ties whips around my torn wrists , and he pulls them tight into the wounds .
tr	1	It lashes out , and I strain against the cuffs , groaning and writhing on the bed .
tr	1	Eventually -- and it probably isn 't so long , really -- I am lying on my side panting .
tr	1	Strange smells cloud the room , and something is buzzing loud as a swarm of bees .
tr	3	I look over to the table and realize it 's just the hum of a laptop .
tr	4	" Ha , " he replies , " not going to be easy with those handcuffs . "
tr	1	" It 's you , " he repeats as if this will clear things right up .
tr	2	We most definitely do not look alike at all except for a similar point to our chins .
tr	4	All the nerves in my arms are numb and then , suddenly , spiky and electric .
tr	1	" The boy I was with last night , " I say and can 't finish .
tr	3	That 's what these angels are too , but they 're not working for any God . "
tr	2	" You know , it 's kind of our policy to never talk about this . "
tr	4	" I 'll keep an open mind , " would have been a clever thing to say .
tr	2	" You know how they say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions ? "
tr	4	He theorized that humans could be made stronger and faster with keener senses -- that anything was possible .
tr	3	I turn them over and watch the veiny pink orbs lift to the surface of my palms .
tr	3	He got his own lab and did a lot of legit stuff that the university knew about .
tr	1	Published papers , gave lectures , that sort of thing , but his true obsession was creating angels .
tr	1	I like this position , feeling that I am as small and unobtrusive as I can be .
tr	0	" Good memory , " he says at last and reaches forward to switch the air on high .
tr	2	All he had to show for years of work were violent lab rats with serious cases of radiation poisoning .
tr	1	My body responds , those bulbs pushing through my palms to lift up from my kneecaps .
tr	3	I tug against my cuffs and concentrate on the pain that runs hot laps around my wrists .
tr	0	Mom always told us that he was a good man , very brave , and funny .
tr	1	My consciousness is confused , wandering through melting dreams and briefly surfacing when I hear voices up front .
tr	2	" If she takes in too much energy , she 'll lose control and be too strong to stop .
tr	1	" Nah , she 's going to live with us for a while , " Gabe says .
tr	2	" We 'll kill or cure all the angels , and our life 's mission will be complete .
tr	3	All emotions must be controlled and locked away so that I can get through this minute .
tr	0	" This is grandma underwear , " I whine , tossing the pack away from me .
tr	2	" It was so genteel of you to let me out of my cuffs for dinner .
tr	0	I could make a mad dash for the front office or scream like a crazy woman .
tr	0	He hands me a bowl and two large plastic bags filled with darting , colorful shapes .
tr	3	Now , I let my hand rest in the bowl of water until the fish forget the intrusion .
tr	2	" You said your father and Dr. Cook destroyed the formula , but the man who took me .
tr	4	" My parents , Karen and Henry , they never hid the fact that I was adopted .
tr	0	I 'm wearing a matching peach tank top and cotton capri pants with yellow hearts around the hems .
tr	2	" Does it comfort you to think she 's in Heaven watching out for you and your little brother ?
tr	1	He twists under me , gasping for breath and throwing a protective arm over his ribs .
tr	0	I put my hands on his chest and slam him back , hard into the ground .
tr	3	I fight against the hunger , but it 's like trying to push away a tidal wave .
tr	4	He gives me a small smile , but can 't keep the tremor out of his extended hand .
tr	0	I peel off my glove and reach through Gabe 's glowing aura to take his hand .
tr	4	The orbs push up with a mad insistence , but I keep the skin of my palms anchored down .
tr	1	If I could transfer this agony into a scream , I think the moon would hear it .
tr	3	The song rears up so loud it drowns out everything but the certainty that I must hold back .
tr	0	I stand up , dizzy and weak , and drop the cat 's body into an alleyway dumpster .
tr	3	I cannot know what they are thinking , but their minds must be laced with doubts .
tr	2	I will bury your body so deep in the ground that no one will ever dig you up .
tr	3	" It don 't stand out , that 's for sure , " Gabe says from the front seat .
tr	2	" Your jealousy of our love is pitiful , " Gabe retorts as I toss the bag to him .
tr	2	" Got punched out on the show floor by one of our clients , " Gabe jumps in .
tr	2	Chapter 19 The house of the Fox brothers stamps a generous footprint across a scraggly plot of land .
tr	3	I want to not be thinking of my apartment and all the books gathering so much dust .
tr	4	I need to stay in the present , let each second crest and break over me without resistance .
tr	1	" We weren 't exactly planning on having any ... uh , " he stumbles for a word .
tr	3	I walk to the king bed and run my hand along the thick , white comforter .
tr	3	I open my mouth to utter some sort of shaky compliment , but my attention is snatched away .
tr	4	I imagine the person on the other side of the lens is goading her to look up .
tr	0	Her head is thrown back , and she is laughing as the groom hooks her in his arms .
tr	1	His brown elf eyes spark with pleasure , and his mischief mouth is cocked into a wide grin .
tr	4	Her ponytail is wet and crooked as if she has just come out from the waves .
tr	1	" Yeah , " he steps back from the doorway and shoves his hands in his pockets .
tr	0	Instead , I calmly pick at my wrists , only it 's hardly any use at all .
tr	1	I pounce onto another branch then clutch one above and swing myself easily around and up onto my feet .
tr	1	" Jesus , put some bells on or something , " he says with a smile .
tr	3	" He can be ... well , sometimes it 's just better not to tell him things . "
tr	0	A Cylon from Battlestar Galactica is locked in deadly combat with a samurai sword-wielding Bratz doll .
tr	2	Sometimes the coroner can 't figure out any other cause of death , so they say radiation poisoning .
tr	2	I load on all my suspicious obits -- those are the red pins -- and look for patterns . "
tr	1	If I confirm angel , the pins turn white , and we load up the car and go . "
tr	2	I don 't know how to be cool or good about this , so I just tell the truth .
tr	0	Probably warned him that I was liable to go on a murderous rampage if let out of sight .
tr	1	The only thing I want is Ryan alive and Grand dead but only after lots of suffering .
tr	0	Gabe lies back on the bench , reaches up and wraps his hands around a bar loaded with weight .
tr	3	On the fifth rep , the bar tilts to the left as Gabe pushes it up with trembling arms .
tr	1	I look at his thin , boy 's body and hide my smirk with another question .
tr	0	" That was my idea actually , " Gabe grins and sits up on the bench .
tr	1	I am highly attuned to his energy , how it rises up as he begins to reach his limit .
tr	1	Gabe looks at me , tugs his shirt back down and smiles in this awkward , sheepish way .
tr	3	" I don 't get the guns ... at the show ... I get ... the contacts . "
tr	4	There are ways to cover your tracks , to be anonymous or to be someone else entirely .
tr	2	As long as they don 't know who you are , they can 't find you . "
tr	4	" No , no , keep going , " Gabe says , but I shake my head .
tr	4	Relieved of guard duty , Gabe steps outside and is soon arguing with his cell phone .
tr	1	I look at the animal now , concentrating on the shivering body beneath its bright , energy .
tr	1	This night I ache with memories , with the vision of my path in life all blown to dust .
tr	0	Investigators propose that I was a victim of a drug gang , cult or some terrifying madman .
tr	0	Each breath carries a thousand particles of sand , rubbing away the lining of my throat .
tr	1	Ryan with his arms folded over his chest looking so unnatural while his family limps by , oh god .
tr	0	I leap onto a tree and get my arms around a raccoon who does not appreciate my embrace .
tr	4	Long , even strides carry him into the foliage , and his energy calms down at last .
tr	1	Maybe I can get him to smile that shy smile that makes him look almost human .
tr	4	Maybe we can find a sliver of the happiness that he is searching for so desperately .
tr	1	Instead , I blithely walk inside and open my mouth to announce a cheerful good morning .
tr	2	When we were old enough , Mom took us on the road to hunt angels . "
tr	0	Grand was always hunting us , and we were always running like hell to slip away .
tr	1	His fingers tap , tap , tap the glass as he gathers himself , tries to push through .
tr	3	" I thought that was the worst day of my life , but it wasn 't . "
tr	0	With a shudder , I turn away and press my hands down hard against the porch .
tr	4	Tammy was the one who killed his brother Lux , so Grand decided to repay her the favor .
tr	0	" Far as I can guess , Grand wanted to track him back here , find our mother .
tr	1	His energy is flagging , and I can lift my hands up and put them in my lap .
tr	0	It 's a shame Gabe can 't see his aura and appreciate its delicate movements and aqua marine shades .
tr	3	I don 't think they know that humans look the best ; must be the best to feed on .
tr	0	" So ... " Gabe says finally , " that must have been pretty awkward this morning .
tr	1	Things should be bound in strait jackets and chains and locked in coffins and encased in cement .
tr	2	I sincerely hope that the ongoing search for my body is not cause for continual distraction .
tr	2	My words fly up , my thoughts remain below : Words without thoughts never to heaven go .
tr	4	I feel slightly better , maybe even a little noble for all the suffering I have endured .
tr	1	Colorado loses its heat at night , but Gabe , as always , seems comfortable in just his t-shirt .
tr	1	For no discernable reason , Gabe begins answering the questions I 'd given up on asking .
tr	2	Look at everyone 's hands , but don 't let them know that you 're looking .
tr	1	Gabe 's voice is soft and shy , and he 's gone back to noticing the stars .
tr	1	Now I 'm looking up at the stars , counting them rapidly in my head because I can now .
tr	4	" Anytime Sis , " he replies , and the word jars me out of my count .
tr	1	" Mom was right , " Gabe says , " this isn 't a good life . "
tr	1	His voice is low and sad and those lines are back , digging in around his mouth .
tr	1	My world is an apocalyptic landscape filled with burned out buildings and ghostly memories drifting through the charred husks .
tr	4	I ice two of them before we set off again and save the last for later .
tr	1	Its tantalizing notes grow louder and louder , tingling down each nerve and building up heat in my hands .
tr	0	But my head is always turning back , eyes landing again and again on Gabe 's sapphire aura .
tr	0	" That 's not enough ... " " At night , which is only what assholes do .
tr	0	" Peachy , " I manage , though I am , in fact , nowhere near peachy .
tr	2	I 'm not sure how to respond , so I don 't say anything at all .
tr	0	On our way to the room , we actually pass a Hispanic guy with an eye patch .
tr	4	Mold seeps through a yellowed stain on the ceiling and rat droppings gleam on the carpet .
tr	1	" Don 't make any calls , don 't let anyone in unless it 's one of us . "
tr	2	I swallow , nod , ignore the tugs of energy all around us from the other motel patrons .
tr	3	Off they go to do whatever it is that angel hunters do in order to find their prey .
tr	2	I tell his plump , nervous mother that I would have gladly given my life for his .
tr	4	The normal bright blue of his energy is muddied and pale , but it 's stable .
tr	2	Gabe knocks on the bathroom door , opens it and drops in the clothes without looking .
tr	1	" It 's just a bundle of , uh , hockey sticks , " Gabe says .
tr	0	I search for the fountain and find it , a marble lion roaring out a gush of water .
tr	0	He shrugs on a backpack , hands Gabe his computer bag and motions for the basketball .
tr	1	The song is still here , always here , but softens as my skin opens to the sunlight .
tr	1	Hoops stand out on his nose and lip , and he wears a skull and cross bones t-shirt .
tr	0	Tedious hours tick by as they examine me , take blood and hair samples and measure my radiation output .
tr	3	I don 't move at all except that my grip on the book puts indents in both covers .
tr	1	The song howls , and the pain joins in , peeling back the layers of my control .
tr	4	Since all you bring me are dead bodies , we can 't even do an anecdotal comparison . "
tr	1	His energy spikes , and I sit up straight , edge my hands under my thighs .
tr	3	" And that was all well and good , but I want to fight , " I insist .
tr	2	Everyone in the world who gets to not know about angels , who doesn 't have to be one .
tr	3	" Okay , so the cops might laugh at first , but you could catch the angels on tape .
tr	4	" Anyone who ever dreamed of being stronger , faster , smarter would demand to be changed .
tr	3	Or maybe it 's just greed -- they don 't want to share what they have .
tr	2	Chapter 33 We make it to Redmond , Washington in the morning , though you would hardly know it .
tr	0	A thick bank of clouds hangs heavy in the sky , their faces gray and threatening .
tr	2	I don 't know what song I 'm humming , so I supply my own words .
tr	0	Mr. Brave is clinging onto the mesh with his front paws and pushing his nose through the wire .
tr	0	I give Gabe a sheepish oops , sorry I 'm a killer of small and adorable animals smile .
tr	4	" This is one big ass park ; we 're talking perfect angel killing ground , " Gabe continues .
tr	4	Though I can still hear the other volunteers nearby , I suddenly feel like we 're alone and vulnerable .
tr	2	Gabe 's energy is smooth and controlled , though I notice it moves fast and tight around his body .
tr	1	The smile on his face grows wider , and this is how I know he 's going to lie .
tr	3	It 's bigger than a lunch box , with a handle jutting out from the top .
tr	0	I stand on a high branch and walk out as far as its strength will support my weight .
tr	0	Scanning the vast area , I try to imagine what route the angel would have taken .
tr	0	I hadn 't realized how far I 'd gone , and I quickly make my way back .
tr	4	" This is that thing the pedicure people use , " I say rubbing my fingers across the stone .
tr	2	" I 'm not asking for forgiveness ; I won 't ever ask for that . "
tr	4	He remembered that Mom took us for a long ride a little while after you were born .
tr	4	" We should have seen him coming , but there were no unusual deaths , no angel activity .
tr	0	I drape myself across a wide branch above him and watch his energy slow and dampen also .
tr	2	There is no aura around him , no dance of emotion , no churning cloud of life .
tr	1	My brain starts inconspicuously edging out of the room , and this is what panic feels like .
tr	2	I am too terrified to touch him , so my hand just lingers above his shoulder .
tr	3	" It 's just that I 'm hungry , and you -- " I say and then stop .
tr	1	" Thank you Jesus , " he mutters , and the red slowly dissipates from his aura .
tr	3	I just pull the itchy blanket tighter around my frame and try not to look at anything .
tr	3	He tries to , and if something happens to him ... I won 't , I just can 't .
tr	1	Gabe 's voice pitches out as a sob that cuts something small and fragile inside of me .
tr	3	His knee pops , and it 's such a normal little thing that I almost laugh .
tr	1	He was checking ... " " ... to make sure I didn 't kill anyone , " I finish .
tr	2	" Alright , so Mom was pissed at my dad and overwhelmed and terrified out of her mind .
tr	0	She rocked me and cried , and I was just staring at her , calm and composed .
tr	1	The skin on my palms is peeling back , the veiny orbs lifting up , throbbing .
tr	3	I turn to take the last rabbit , but the door hangs open , and the cage is empty .
tr	1	He pulls the blanket up over his shoulders as if this could possibly hide his energy .
tr	2	After a while I pull my legs to my chest and rock slowly back and forth .
tr	0	" What about ... " and here I make my voice all breathy and romantic , " Francesca ? "
tr	2	" No , no , it 's very important , " he says without looking up .
tr	3	Looking at my brother 's face , I realize that I 've just lost my lunch .
tr	1	" I was in a lake , and I couldn 't swim even though I can in real life .
tr	0	I don 't really want to know , but in a small voice I ask , " What happened ?
tr	3	A fish blunders into my hand , and I pull it up out of the water .
tr	2	No harm will come to those puppies , not while Agent Adama is on the job .
tr	0	He 's changed out of the sheriff 's uniform that fit him tight in the shoulders .
tr	2	" Alright , so turns out that one of our Marias works for a guy on my list .
tr	1	Address , house layout , everything , " Gabe says , and his voice is losing its humor .
tr	0	" Yeah ... " I pause a beat too long , " clearly that goes without saying . "
tr	3	I get that , but I 'm here now , and this is my fight too .
tr	2	As soon as they shut the door , I close my eyes and slowly count down from 10 .
tr	1	It helps with the pain of scrubbing off my skin for the second night in a row .
tr	4	A camera perched on the fence is turned away , and its red light is dark .
tr	3	I launch myself over the gate , arcing to avoid the sharp points at the top .
tr	0	Strands of hair stick to my face , and I tuck them back behind my ears .
tr	2	" And so you wanted to give your own a little leg up on the food chain ? "
tr	2	I 've got a part to play , so I hush my voice , turn it hollow and cold .
tr	1	His rings click against the polished surface reminding me of another click I heard a short while ago .
tr	1	I climb , hands digging into the tree trunk , pine needles combing into my hair .
tr	1	I am soaked and shivering , sucking on my torn fingertips as I jump from branch to branch .
tr	0	That I 'm an angel , and angels are meant to be better than humans . "
tr	2	" And that 's not all ... " The girl lifts her legs and allows herself to fall .
tr	2	" I don 't want to die , so I 'm going to have to kill you instead . "
tr	0	Pine needles grab savagely at my hair as I pull myself up on a steady branch .
tr	1	I know I 'm dying , and for some strange reason I only want to laugh .
tr	0	I twist my head away from his hands and scramble backwards into the solid tree at my back .
tr	2	If I were brave , I would say " no , you shouldn 't do it alone . "
tr	1	" After Grand captured you , tortured you , why would he just let you go ? "
tr	2	I wait for more , the spill of confession , the breakdown , the stubborn justifications .
tr	1	All I get is his face in profile , tiny flicks of energy escaping his grip .
tr	1	I slump against the window , balling my hands into fists and tucking them between my legs .
tr	2	You could have warned me or hid me , or , I don 't know , something . "
tr	2	I will bury your body so deep in the ground that no one will ever dig you up .
tr	2	Gabe rolls onto his stomach , props himself up on his elbows so that he can turn toward me .
tr	4	It 's our fault they 're here , so we have to make it right again . "
tr	1	I can almost see the memories playing across his mind , pressing sharp nails against his psyche .
tr	2	I look down at the crazy , terrible paragraphs scrawled on the pages of my notebook .
tr	3	Her writing partner is a bunny named Avalon who contributes to each manuscript by trying to eat it .
tr	0	We 're all tired and achy , and Gabe finds us a room at a rundown inn .
tr	0	" I 've got ta ' shake a leg if you know what I mean . "
tr	1	" Okay , " he says softly , though there 's still a hint of mistrust in his features .
tr	0	The second is short , slighter than his companion and blanketed with thick dark hair on each arm .
tr	0	Gabe 's aura starts to jump , but he takes a deep breath and it soothes back down .
tr	4	He is filthy , brown hair matted to his head , deep cuts and gouges marring his pale face .
tr	4	I push open the door , and yep , it gives out a nice , lusty creak .
tr	0	At your advanced age , your chances of finding a good marriage are exceedingly low . "
tr	2	" Oh , three hours of solid sleep , no wonder you are so perky and loud . "
tr	0	Anyway , she carries the Safe Passage Certificates , so there is no way around taking her along .
tr	2	Harry spotted Taylor at the door and shouted across the room , " Get over here Taylor .
tr	2	" How do you know that the reports and images were not fabrications for propaganda ? "
tr	3	We all remember their handiwork and it just did not seem to fit in with that . "
tr	4	The seize fire seems stable enough that we can do without a few resources for some time .
tr	4	The noise level in the assembly rose dramatically as everyone started discussing various matters at the same time .
tr	1	Taylor turned to Harry and grabbed his arm , " Thank you , you won 't regret this . "
tr	2	Who 's gon na watch your back if your ' specialists ' turn on you or on each other .
tr	2	Mary put a large cup of black steaming coffee on the counter in front of Taylor .
tr	3	It just now began to really sink in that his big adventure was about to start .
tr	3	The ancient vehicle made its way through the night and stopped a short distance from where Taylor was waiting .
tr	3	He was not in the mood to start the trip with bad blood between the two of them .
tr	2	" Good morning , " Taylor started , " did you two get a good night 's sleep ? "
tr	0	This here is my luggage , " she added pointing at a small Khaki colored backpack .
tr	0	Taylor always got excited when he heard the fuel truck making its way across the parking ramp .
tr	3	He started to unwind the fuel hose and climbed up the foot peg on the right wing strut .
tr	2	Like good little soldiers they lined up in front of the bathroom door to take turns .
tr	2	Cody Hunt was the last one out and locked the steel door with an old-fashioned pad lock .
tr	0	Spade huffed at him and turned around to hear what Taylor was telling them about safety procedures .
tr	4	The engine sputtered just a little before it gained speed all the way to its maximum RPM setting .
tr	3	We just knew that this was the beginning of something that we would be unable to stop . "
tr	3	There was no end in sight for the attention that this insignificant little note was getting .
tr	3	We retracted the text within 213 milliseconds but we don 't know if it was still distributed .
tr	3	Next to every line in his long list was a little bomb icon with a date and time stamp .
tr	0	It was more like a trickle at first , an annoying side bar to the mainstream media channels .
tr	3	With that she stepped out into the hallway and rushed down two flights of stairs to the library floor .
tr	1	With a newfound spring in her step Rachel Summers almost ran up the stairs back to her classroom .
tr	2	She crossed the room to her desk and dropped the heavy book onto it with a loud thud .
tr	2	With smooth application of backpressure to the elevator control and plane lifted effortlessly from the ground .
tr	0	Farmer was clearly not feeling well and Taylor could only hope that he had had a light breakfast .
tr	4	The lake quietly sparkled in the morning light and only a few vehicles were in sight .
tr	3	For more than two hours they followed Interstate 30 to bring them closer to their destination .
tr	4	Helen Spade removed her hand from Farmer 's leg with an apologetic look on her face .
tr	4	Savoring the peaceful scenery just a moment longer Taylor turned back to the business at hand .
tr	2	He almost forgot about his travel companions and rushed forward into the emerald tunnel in front of them .
tr	1	He had been traveling with Hunt long enough to trust his instincts and keen sense of direction .
tr	4	About three hours after they had left the plane he disappeared into the woods for almost ten minutes .
tr	3	It was not unpleasant yet but they were glad that they had brought the tents and sleeping bags .
tr	3	It took Taylor and Spade only a few minutes to upright the tents and stow their belongings .
tr	1	" Never travel without a frying pan and a coffee pot , " he announced triumphantly presenting both utensils .
tr	4	Out of the blue Helen Spade turned to Taylor , " You and Hunt are very close .
tr	1	We were flying under the radar with no lights and only basic navigation , no radios and no maps .
tr	1	Hunt jumps out of the plane and everyone starts hugging and kissing him like the long lost son . "
tr	4	Again , Hunt found them all the fresh water they needed and another lovely resting place for the night .
tr	3	" The most important thing , " she lectured , " is that I feel good ! "
tr	2	Suddenly he had an idea , " What did you mean by ' That I feel good ' ?
tr	3	They ran and stumbled through the woods and lost the woman out of their sight within half a mile .
tr	0	His last question earned Taylor a laughing fit that would have made any big city standup comedian proud .
tr	2	" Hi Lilly love , " Lilly Ann greeted the little girl , " where is your mummy ? "
tr	1	" I am painting rings in the water with my feet , " Lilly replied enthusiastically .
tr	3	" O.k. , that 's one way to look at it , I never thought about it that way .
tr	3	Now it was on Taylor to almost choke on the laughter that exploded in his chest .
tr	1	Spade 's challenging tone did not dim Lilly Ann 's bright smile for even one moment .
tr	3	" No , that 's all , " she said lightly , " It 's settled then .
tr	4	I 'll come back later and take you to a place where we can eat supper . "
tr	0	Taylor and his mates stared after her until she disappeared around a bend in the road .
tr	2	You could have asked for that whole damn mountain and she would have given it to you . "
tr	3	Setting up camp was a practiced routine by then and only took them a few minutes .
tr	0	We should probably catalog the animal and plant species that they can provide and take it from there . "
tr	2	" Very good , " Taylor agreed , " you two stay put and get going on the catalog .
tr	2	" Good , " Taylor agreed , " come on , let 's have a look around . "
tr	3	They laughed , hesitated a moment and started walking in opposite directions almost smacking into each other .
tr	1	If we don 't find anything we return to the camp and wait for Lilly Ann .
tr	0	Colorful paintings and mosaics covered all outside surfaces creating a stark contrast to nature 's colors all around .
tr	3	Taylor wanted to avoid direct contact with anyone until his rapport with Lilly Ann was solidified further .
tr	4	The air was calm so the chimes did not move or sound but they were impressive nonetheless .
tr	1	Hunt flared his nostrils and announced , " Smells like French fries , no wait , doughnuts .
tr	4	They were a little annoyed but not too surprised to see the camp abandoned at their return .
tr	1	Everything was neat and tidy and nothing was missing but no sign of Farmer or Spade .
tr	4	She looked proudly upon her trusty ride and turned to her visitors with a beaming smile .
tr	4	Hunt , Spade and Farmer squeezed into the van and she quickly shut the door behind them .
tr	3	What a pity that the only place left for Helen Spade to sit on was Tim Farmers lap .
tr	1	He had brought a tray with him loaded with six shot glasses filled with an ominous looking clear liquid .
tr	2	" Small world , son , a small magical world indeed , " Fritz replied with a knowing smile .
tr	3	If it 's cattle that you want we have to take a little ride out of town .
tr	2	" Do you want me to look at your car 's motor while the others do the DNA scanning ?
tr	2	He obviously did not recognize the great artistic accomplishment within the chaotic collection of colors and shapes .
tr	2	" And no , I do not think this is the way your car is supposed to sound .
tr	4	Across the place a middle-aged man looked up from the hooves of the horse he was about to inspect .
tr	4	Spotting Lilly Ann and her rolling canvas a big smile revealed an impressive mouthful of gleaming white teeth .
tr	1	" Cody is going to help sort the animals and bring them to us for the scanning .
tr	1	That 's going to be fun watch the guy wrestle cows , " she said mischievously .
tr	0	They bucked and kicked and screamed and had a blast running around in circles to avoid being caught .
tr	4	It took every bit of ten hours to process the complete herd one cow at a time .
tr	2	He sat his find down onto the ground and began to clean the tools with an old oily rag .
tr	1	Taylor was knocked off his socks , well , he was sitting in the grass already .
tr	2	We just need to find a small piece of old plastic floor covering or something similar . "
tr	4	Expertly he mimicked all the intricate curves and openings from the metal template onto the plastic material .
tr	2	" I 'll tell you in a minute , " Taylor chuckled , " go ahead . "
tr	3	Lilly Ann put in the first gear and took off with gravel shooting out under the back wheels .
tr	0	Keep it slow and be happy that you can hear yourself think for a change . "
tr	3	He knew that this was most likely their last chance to talk in private in a long time .
tr	4	The weather girls ' predictions of a change in conditions already showed promise to be accurate .
tr	2	Just a few more cloud formations to pass and they would be clear of the threatening conditions .
tr	3	he shouted , " I will try to make it back to the landing site ! "
tr	2	I 'm not going to write off this old raccoon before I danced at his funeral .
tr	1	" I got the recorder but Mr. Taylor 's parachute was on fire so he couldn 't jump .
tr	2	A huge beam of light span from one cloud tower to another followed by a mighty thunder roar .
tr	4	" The branches must have broken his fall , " the older one , Joe Jack , replied .
tr	3	They knew exactly where to cut through the woods to the wide road that led up the mountain .
tr	1	Jack and Joe Jack are carrying him , quick , I think he is hurt . "
tr	3	Lilly Ann stood in her slippers and robe to inquire about the tumult the little girl was causing .
tr	0	Chapter 7 : Lilly Ann Three nights and three days Lilly Ann sat at Taylor 's bed .
tr	0	" Jack said there was a fire , " Lilly Ann mused , " who knows . "
tr	3	Taylor 's eyes got back some of their clarity but his face was still contorted from pain .
tr	2	" Oh no , " Lilly Ann protested , " I only joke about really important stuff .
tr	0	It was as if a cold damp cloud had wandered into the room and caught a hold of them .
tr	2	When they brought you into town Lilly recognized you and told them to bring you to Lilly Ann .
tr	0	How can I ever thank Jack and Joe Jack or you two , for that matter .
tr	0	His face brightened and an imaginative mind could almost say they saw a smile play around his lips .
tr	2	We also do not have the means to transport you off the mountain safely and quickly .
tr	1	The moment passed quickly and next thing she was almost on the floor holding her sides , laughing uncontrollably .
tr	4	She was absolutely positive to find the pot under a pile of bent and tarnished silver ware .
tr	1	" I 'll be right back , " Lilly Ann said skipping out of the room .
tr	4	Her eyes bulged as she tried to decipher the unusual complexity of taste elements that danced on her tongue .
tr	3	They sat quietly taking their time to enjoy every sip of the invigorating drink to the fullest .
tr	0	Taylor had that feeling again that he was missing vital information , " I don 't understand . "
tr	0	He tried to read in their faces if what he had said had any impact on them at all .
tr	0	Every little kid knows all about Abraham and Law of Attraction and everything that comes along with it .
tr	3	It is not quite obvious to us where to start explaining it to a novice in the matter . "
tr	3	She could not help herself but tease Taylor a little bit and get his thoughts swirling .
tr	1	If you can maintain a positive emotional mood or vibration you will live the equivalent positive life experience . "
tr	4	So the question is how can we choose our emotional state independent of our observed reality ? "
tr	3	" Right , " Edie May complied , " your thoughts attract other thoughts with a similar vibration .
tr	0	What you think and therefore feel and what manifests is always a vibrational match , no exception . "
tr	3	Edie May smiled at Taylor and gave him time to fight out the struggle that raged within him .
tr	4	Edie May and Taylor were zapped out of their contemplation by a giggly cheery voice from the door .
tr	2	" I am not sure I follow you , " Taylor felt like a fish out of water .
tr	3	" I think I understand , " Taylor nodded , " So what about the poles ? "
tr	3	The next one up is really angry , you don 't want to mess with him right now .
tr	0	Taylor asked while turning to another page , " I saw a signature L. F. on many of them .
tr	0	I get all fuzzy and warm good feelings when I go on a rampage of appreciation myself .
tr	1	I 'm curious already who gets a whiff of it first and stops by to join in . "
tr	4	We would carefully cut some of the mistletoe for decorating the tavern tonight to everyone 's delight .
tr	2	People stood up from the floor and from chairs and started to shuffle out of the room .
tr	2	" I am going to bed too , are you going to be all right ? "
tr	1	The lights came on upstairs in Lilly Ann 's house as they did in many houses nearby .
tr	1	" John , listen to me , " she said emphatically , " focus on my hands .
tr	3	What a pleasant surprise that a rough tongue licking his toes was the first sensation of the new day .
tr	0	Lilly Ann added and laid flat on her back on the floor and started to imitate Taylor 's movements .
tr	0	" No , but speaking of ham , I am hungry let 's go get breakfast .
tr	4	She sat next to Taylor on the bed and watched his efforts to bend his knees .
tr	1	" This is good , " he said in between small laughs , " now what ? "
tr	4	" Oh boy , " Edie May rolled her eyes and retreated out of the kitchen .
tr	1	Within seconds they were surrounded by a wild cluster of little arms and hands dancing and hollering around them .
tr	2	Lilly Ann pulled Taylor along to a milky glass door across the hall leaving his young admirers behind .
tr	1	Dim light was radiating from an out of place looking device in the middle of the desktop .
tr	3	We only use the programs that came with it to retrieve and study the wisdom it contains .
tr	0	Taylor got up from the couch with much groaning and a gratefully accepted helping hand from Lilly Ann .
tr	0	Lilly Ann was back after a short while cheerfully dangling a paper bag in front of his face .
tr	2	" You wan na go first to pull me up or follow me to push ? "
tr	3	What was that again with putting a boat in the river and going with the flow ?
tr	0	" Really , " Taylor frowned , " care to run that by me again ? "
tr	1	" I don 't believe it , " he said , " when did you do this ? "
tr	2	" Right , " he frowned , " so what is all of this good for ?
tr	3	The thought that all of this had been caused by his own thinking was almost too much to bear .
tr	2	You are doing so exceptionally well , you can allow yourself to relax a little . "
tr	1	" Neat , " Lilly Ann said with a big smile , " did you ask her ? "
tr	1	I still don 't get why I would ask her about an important life decision . "
tr	2	, ' Do I tear down my house and build a new one or not ? '
tr	2	, simple things , you know , boil it down on your own to ' This or that ? '
tr	0	Lilly Ann clapped her hands and laughed , " You just found out what you really want .
tr	0	That 's what I did , I think I was about three and a half years old . "
tr	1	It wasn 't ill spirited and the innocent curiosity lead to many interesting discussions and pleasurable chitchat .
tr	2	" Michael , would you do me a favor , " Taylor spoke to the young man .
tr	0	That 's as heroic as it gets , " he said passionately , " around here at least . "
tr	2	" No need to apologize , " Taylor said , " no , really , thank you .
tr	1	Lilly Ann asked Taylor later during their occasional pre dinner drink on Lilly Ann 's back porch .
tr	3	" Got it , " Taylor conceded , " that 's why I am studying all the time .
tr	0	" I know , " she replied lightly , " but what 's the rush ? "
tr	3	" You know what bothers me about that whole ' Just ask Lilly ' idea ? "
tr	1	He didn 't know how to find the right words in the face of such innocence .
tr	0	" Nah , " she squealed shaking her head that her hair flew all around her head .
tr	1	Chapter 13 : John Kisses Good The next morning Lilly Ann was in especially high spirits .
tr	3	" About the party , " Lilly Ann gave up just enough to bait the trap .
tr	0	After breakfast Lilly Ann showed Taylor the magical world of her under staircase walk in closet .
tr	2	She opened a tall gliding door cabinet that revealed a row of formal suits of various colors and styles .
tr	1	" You will have to wait until you see , " she said in a promising tone .
tr	3	Taylor thanked his stars for the lucky fact that there used to be a male occupant in the house .
tr	1	Daily necessities such as shaving utensils were still at hand and he put them to good use .
tr	0	The lather of the slightly perfumed shaving soap was rich and smooth and gave his skin a glowing appearance .
tr	3	This was new , and Taylor had a suspicion that it would not be the last thing this evening .
tr	2	He slipped into the formal coat and stood in front of the mirror for final inspection .
tr	2	" You can come out now , " Taylor heard Lilly Ann from the top of the stairs .
tr	3	Taylor could not help but gasp at the image that seemed to appear out of thin air before him .
tr	4	It must have been a man who came up with shoes like that , " she laughed .
tr	3	Taylor was not used to being the center of attention and for sure not of such positive attention .
tr	3	Just as some of the guests indicated their inability to continue the carnal feast , music started to play .
tr	2	The world fell away from around them lost in a cloud of sound and touch and smell .
tr	3	Hesitation for the sake of savoring the anticipation was all that kept them apart for just a second longer .
tr	2	No power in the world and far beyond would have been strong enough to change what had to come .
tr	4	Startled they both pulled back ever so slightly to look for reassurance in the other 's face .
tr	1	Like fireworks their touch exploded - no wait , that sound did not come from within their lively imagination .
tr	4	" Let 's get out of here , " Lilly Ann whispered into Taylor 's ear .
tr	3	No one paid much attention as the secretive pair quietly slipped to the exit to vanish into the night .
tr	3	A short walk that might just as well have taken forever brought them back to Lilly Ann 's house .
tr	3	Oh , that toe looks familiar after all , the big cat thought and playfully started to nibble .
tr	4	He walked into the dark living room , clapped his hands twice and the lights came on . "
tr	4	The little guy seemed to be the only one who had power over the lights . "
tr	3	He just knew that there would not be an answer that he could comprehend at that time .
tr	3	The Wal * Mart store had seen better days but the main structure was mostly intact .
tr	3	" Turn it off , " Taylor winced , " you 'll fry the starter motor . "
tr	1	" Oh my , " he said , " This is going to be fun . "
tr	3	Three or four revolutions of the starter were enough to spark the ignition in the mighty motor .
tr	1	Inside the building behind them a big block of ice fell noisily into the capture trough .
tr	2	" You 'll know , Tom , " he still laughed , " you 'll know . "
tr	3	He went out the front gate up to the mighty willow tree in front of Lilly Ann 's house .
tr	1	If something breaks from now on and I am near it , it won 't be my doing . "
tr	3	Without even so much as a thought he turned the ignition and pushed the starter button .
tr	2	Taylor had volunteered to help in the forest brigades to supply wood for fireplaces and stoves around town .
tr	2	" Prost , " Taylor offered the old Austrian drinking cheer and cautiously took a sip .
tr	2	He stood up from his chair and dropped down on his knee in front of her .
tr	3	Just like that , straight out , what 's the use to dance around it , right ?
tr	2	" Not now , " she purred , " don 't you see that I am working ? "
tr	2	" Did they throw you out of the house or did you escape on your own ? "
tr	3	It was all in good fun though and time seemed to fly and stand still at once .
tr	0	His first clap was followed by a thundering applause and cheering and wild outbursts of primal joy .
tr	4	You would not believe how many life long relationships started with the girl dancing for the guys .
tr	0	It 's a personal expression , a calling card , and an art form just as any other .
tr	0	He hugged his father 's shoulder and led him to Taylor who had gotten up from the bench .
tr	3	Willie had borrowed a car from a friend that swiftly took the groom 's party to their destination .
tr	2	Today I choose to be yours , and I am eternally grateful for your choice to be mine . "
tr	4	Without averting his eyes that were locked onto hers he reached for Lilly Ann 's hand .
tr	2	" This ring was once a symbol of love for one you loved and one you still love .
tr	4	With these simple words she slipped a plain wide band of silvery metal onto Taylor 's finger .
tr	2	Chapter 16 : Goodbye Papa " Are you going to stay around for some time ? "
tr	3	" I bet he can 't wait to get on that ride , " Lilly Ann said excited .
tr	3	" How can you know that this is not just you imagination talking back and forth ?
tr	1	" Nothing , " Fritz winked at him , " Just think of me once in a while .
tr	4	He appreciates every one of you for making his life a bit more special every day .
tr	0	Him and grandma are having a thing going again , whatever that means where they are now .
tr	2	Taylor had gone back to creating artwork from all kinds of metal objects that he found all over town .
tr	0	Taylor put down the pair of pliers he was clutching and looked at Lilly Grace a bit embarrassed .
tr	3	" Ok , " Taylor interrupted her , " but people don 't usually do that .
tr	3	As a matter of fact it was one of the first thoughts to bring this universe into existence .
tr	4	" What 's the story with being here and not quite here at the same time ?
tr	1	Taylor had lost all his trepidation of openly discussing these issues with his mother in law .
tr	4	He took a piece of metal and wielded it into shape in the fires of that little sun .
tr	2	Now Taylor was eager to seize the moment to gain more clarity for his own questions .
tr	4	Source is not concerned about any of us messing up her perfect song with our imperfect vibration .
tr	3	" I guess it means that all is well , " Lilly Ann brought everything to the point .
tr	3	At the tender age of four , Wilbur launched his first attempt to take to the air for himself .
tr	4	The idea that formed in his head was as far fetched as any he had ever dreamed up .
tr	4	" You like the bird , " Joe Jack 's remark was more a statement than a question .
tr	2	Jack and Jo Jack nodded their heads , turned around and disappeared in the direction they had come from .
tr	4	He coughed a few times to get the smoke out of his lungs and turned to kiss Lilly Ann .
tr	1	He turned to Wilbur , who grinned from ear to ear , giddy from his successful coup .
tr	2	" If you are not too busy , of course , sir , " he added hastily .
tr	4	" We would need an engine and wheels , " Taylor felt right in his element .
tr	2	" So , you are going to help me , " Wilbur almost couldn 't contain himself .
tr	1	Taylor looked at Wilbur with raised eyebrows , " I guess you got yourself a partner , partner .
tr	3	Taylor 's suggestion to just take a big brush and paint the whole thing white was met with disgust .
tr	3	Not even five hours later Wilbur sat patiently in his truck in front of Taylor 's house and waited .
tr	1	" I picked up something special this morning , " he announced with an excited grin on his face .
tr	0	He lowered the tailgate and pulled out a long object that was carefully wrapped in thick fabric padding .
tr	0	It was carved out of very dark laminated wood and had the hub of its predecessor already installed .
tr	0	" That 's it , " Taylor simply said , " You got yourself an airplane . "
tr	3	Wilbur nodded , confident that he would not have any difficulty turning the motor in order to start it .
tr	4	Wilbur pulled the leather gloves he was wearing tight one more time and stepped up to the propeller .
tr	1	" I 'll let Willie know , " she said without making an effort to get going .
tr	3	He so hoped that he could get used to that kind of thing rather sooner than later .
tr	0	He raised his hand to the agreed upon sign and pointed his thumb to his back .
tr	4	He took a deep breath , consciously loosened his fingers and gently pushed the stick to the right .
tr	4	After having performed a few turns and circles Wilbur tapped Taylor 's shoulder , time to fly home .
tr	3	She thought about it for a moment , " What would you tell them this time ? "
tr	3	The fact that I came back to talk about it would be proof enough , right ? "
tr	0	I always considered her an angel in the midst of the sometimes rough crowd at a paramilitary airport . "
tr	2	Just don 't forget who you have become when you think about where you have come from . "
tr	0	" O.k. , you got it , " Taylor said , glancing at her dress again .
tr	2	Taylor heard Lilly Ann 's frustrated question followed by noisy sniffling as he opened the bedroom door .
tr	0	Taylor was alarmed and amused at the same time of his mate 's out of character antics .
tr	3	" But you are so great with kids , " Taylor tried to get a word in .
tr	2	Your worth and benefit to this society is out of the question , and so is your children 's .
tr	3	Strange timing in all of this , I don 't really know what to make of it . "
tr	4	He has seen it work though , so he was determined to give it a try .
tr	2	" I think Lilly wants to say hello to us , " Lilly Ann announced a few moments later .
tr	4	, but they of course had a couple of ideas for me - or rather my wallet .
tr	3	It was one of his contacts from when the hunt had been on for the aircraft .
tr	0	One afternoon a new pilot had a problem with his Hunters landing gear and its right undercarriage collapsed .
tr	4	They then sealed them all up against inclement weather and successfully passed that part of their training .
tr	0	Blast I thought , perhaps another day , and vacated the cockpit and wandered over to him .
tr	3	He was from Customs ( with a capital C ) , and didn 't we just know it .
tr	2	' Good job ' I thought , ' I wasn 't going to offer you one anyway ' .
tr	0	The leader of the crew was physically shaking , and a ' suit ' walked smartly in .
tr	4	' Oh yes ' I said , feigning shock , ' and what 's the purple one for ? '
tr	4	Can I take my jacket off , ' it 's sweltering in here ' and 2 .
tr	4	' Don 't tell me , you stole the Sukhoi and have come here to claim asylum ? '
tr	0	I was almost reduced to tears , and it had yet to be performed by an aircraft .
tr	3	I just knew that they would all be devastated that they wouldn 't be getting the position .
tr	3	' Ok ' he said , ' I will tell HHR to get the gold paint out then ' .
tr	3	' Go forth and multiply ' the voices continued ' and leave the pretty little packages to us ' .
tr	2	' Well thank you kindly son , oh , and you wouldn 't do me a favour would you ?
tr	4	Three hours fifty-nine minutes and fifty-eight seconds after the kidnapping the camera covering the stud farm zoomed out .
tr	3	' If this doesn 't make him want to kill these animals nothing will ' she thought .
tr	0	He really did think that he was so so funny ( and so did his brother ) .
tr	0	Every legitimate bank account that he created had installed in it a ' back door ' .
tr	2	The information didn 't do her ( or the cameraman ) much good but it worked wonders for him .
tr	0	Colonel Jameson was not at all pleased that he had been put in a ' no win ' situation .
tr	4	If he had known what he was really up against he would have tried to handle it differently .
tr	0	David had insisted that a camera was always pointing down the entrance road , just in case .
tr	3	' That 's quite right ' I said , ' but I haven 't got one ' .
tr	1	Not only had I inherited Topsy with three of my aircraft , I had also inherited his barbeque .
tr	1	After the Christmas break it was down to serious training for both the aircrew and ground crew alike .
tr	0	One player then lays a card , and the other one has to try and follow suit .
tr	0	Yet again Sally did her screaming bit , and then told Natasha to look in her rear view mirror .
tr	3	Melvyn was just about the only one of my pilots that I didn 't really get along with .
tr	0	' What is an endoscopy ' Sasha asked , ' and why do I need an anaesthetist ? '
tr	3	' Trying to find a decent Hotel , I left him cruising the streets in a taxi . '
tr	4	Finally she reached her objective , shone the torch at an obscure angle and looked obliquely at the mirror .
tr	0	As I now had an abundance of drop tanks John and Topsy had modified a few .
tr	3	Alice and Gerry 's ' little cottage ' was situated in the beautiful and tranquil New Forest .
tr	1	David Williams my Director of Security informs me that you have come across something incredible in your travels .
tr	1	' Leave that with me ' said David , in his ' plausible deniability ' voice .
tr	2	' How about by becoming my personal rotary wing pilot -- when can you start ? '
tr	4	When the blades finally came to a halt I exited the helicopter and went to look inside the hangar .
tr	2	A confused Marcus looked on , surly it was normally a more democratic process than this ?
tr	3	' Does that mean that there is ' dead ' steam running about out there ? '
tr	1	~ ~ ~ ~ Chapter 25 As spring finally sprung towards summer I was feeling pretty good with myself .
tr	1	I said into the intercom , and almost instantaneously he came in and stood in front of me .
tr	0	' If it 's not going to cause a problem , please can I stay ? '
tr	3	Drat , but I did notice that she didn 't offer to let her brother do the driving .
tr	2	It looked hideous ( the painting , not the figure ) so obviously it would cost a small fortune .
tr	2	Paco 's wife , Alba , took Kia off to play and he led her into his treatment room .
tr	0	And then Paco went against the mainstream specialists and declared my room ' a noisy area ' .
tr	1	If something wasn 't done , and soon , it would go critical and quite literally fry itself .
tr	4	and delivered the valedictorian at high-school , college and university ( was that like being a postie ? )
tr	1	Next it was Topsy 's turn , was I up for a quick trip in my wheelchair ?
tr	2	Since then I 've watched the world go through monumental changes many good , some not so good .
tr	1	As I sat in the fading twilight , I couldn 't help wondering how many had survived .
tr	1	In short , civilization was beginning to show the stress cracks wherein lay the seeds of its destruction .
tr	2	I was ridiculed , berated , and told I should stick to digging up pots and bones .
tr	2	Retirement had put me in a quandary , sorta too old to work and too young to die .
tr	4	Those few who came through Astor painted a picture of conditions so terrible they were , unspeakable .
tr	1	I felt taking down the mast was necessary as I doubted the bridges would remain in working condition .
tr	0	I could also watch a movie , play games , write in my journal , or use the laptop .
tr	3	Throughout the next day , the winds howled but by late afternoon , it began to subside .
tr	3	Then the skinny one took out a knife and cut through the saran while the other stood guard .
tr	1	The big guy said , " Shut your fuckin ' mouth , jus cause we ate your bitch ... .
tr	3	I decided to take the rifle with the scope , the shotgun , and the semi-automatic 22 pistol .
tr	4	She had been forced to watch her family raped , butchered and eaten by Skinny and his big buddy .
tr	0	I said , " Had a premonition this was going to happen and planned ahead . "
tr	0	That was before the gang came by , and we still had a good supply of food . "
tr	1	The next morning with a clear sky and the sun shining brightly , we departed on our sojourn .
tr	0	She said , " I sure can and I 'm won 't be afraid to . "
tr	4	I tied the wheel , let it idle and jumped over the side into the canoe .
tr	2	I took the solar panels and mounted them in a very shallow vee on the houseboats roof .
tr	0	The houseboat already had an inverter and by tomorrow night we should have both AC and DC .
tr	1	It 's just a suggestion , if I 'm out of line just say so . "
tr	0	Who knows we may be Adam and Eve , a young skinny Eve and a very old Adam ?
tr	1	I had to admit it wasn 't a very romantic beginning to our April , November relationship .
tr	3	I took the rig over to the houseboat and spent the better part of the day hooking it up .
tr	1	I said , " I think so , sounds like someone 's reading off a list of names . "
tr	0	Finally , we settled on standard so were left with almost a two and a half wait .
tr	0	He also said there was a national AM station that just started broadcasting from Washington then we signed off .
tr	3	Not to mention all the bills , it 's great having no more bills to pay .
tr	4	I said , " Were spending all our time together , and I never grow tired of it .
tr	0	I heard a voice say , " GW you in there , its Gator Sam , wake up . "
tr	2	He looked over at me grinned and said , " looks like you doing OK for yourself . "
tr	1	It had been horrific ; way over two hundred million Americans had perished in the initial Collapse .
tr	4	People who made it to the camps died either of diseases such as Ebola or starved .
tr	3	There wasn 't enough diesel , transportation , or labor available yet to start full-scale production .
tr	4	Life at Silver Glen was pleasant we had been alone except for the visits from Sam and Joyce .
tr	0	Connie and I were always as busy as pack rats scavenging for anything we felt would improve our lot .
tr	2	Behind us ; some chief hollered , " Knock it off , shows over , back to work . "
tr	4	In the time , we have together we can still pack in a lifetime of living .
tr	1	Our bodies touched hands caressing as our passion grew in intensity until we joined becoming one .
tr	0	The officer , who appeared to be in charge , said , " Captain Collins , come aboard . "
tr	4	They like the ones who were settling in Astor were anxiously looking forward to a new life .
tr	4	We spent the weekend planting potatoes , talking gardening , greenhouses , and livestock while enjoying the Glen .
tr	2	If it does come down to stay or go , I 'll let you make the final decision . "
tr	2	I said , " You sure you want to stop , let 's just go on . "
tr	0	I walked out the back door ; Skipper had what appeared to be a human femur in his mouth .
tr	2	That evening we anchored off the old Gibson Dry Dock ; Connie had the albums out going through them .
tr	4	Laying there wide awake I desperately needed to hold and feel her warmth in my arms .
tr	1	The voice said , " That 's fine sir , we 'll wait on you . "
tr	3	I 'll make arrangements to get you into a proper berth tomorrow if that 's alright with you . "
tr	0	He laughed , came over and shook hands and with a wave of his hand invited us to sit .
tr	1	There has to be something in it to fulfill the basic spiritual need we all harbor within us .
tr	0	Allan said , " Your right , that 's why I wanted you here I 'm glad you came .
tr	1	I looked over at Connie she had sat listening intently and hadn 't made a comment .
tr	3	" Some guys thought so , but I always felt like I was caught in the middle .
tr	0	That night we made unadulterated , love our passion for each other a constant in an ever-changing world .
tr	0	The gig arrived right on time ; a young sailor came aboard and hauled in the anchor .
tr	1	" I said , " How in the hell did you swing something like that ? "
tr	2	Allan shuffled us from one group to another stopping for a just a perfunctory introduction and handshake .
tr	1	I said , " Allan why are you digging so deep into this thing anyway ? "
tr	1	He smiled and said , " No problem the base commissary will fix you right up . "
tr	2	" Why George Collins you 're finally offering to make an honest woman out of me .
tr	3	He said , " I didn 't want to miss this , got your speech all written out ? "
tr	3	Our reward for getting it right will be to enter into that long sought after heaven .
tr	3	I was at loose ends , outside of attending meetings I found myself with little to do .
tr	4	You won 't have a crew , there in Hastings digging potatoes or spread all over hell 's creation .
tr	0	I asked Allan , " What business do I have on a damned research ship anyway . "
tr	2	You can get a good picture of conditions down there bring back the facts and make recommendations .
tr	2	George , have Jim show you around if anything crops up I 'll let you know . "
tr	3	Jim said , " Plenty we 're waiting for dark and the Thetis to catch up . "
tr	1	During the next few hours , we closed on the pair of unknown blips plodding along in the darkness .
tr	4	With the glasses , I could make out his forward guns they were now manned and being trained .
tr	1	He said , " Yes sir one small leak starboard amidships being dealt with , nothing serious . "
tr	1	I said , " Good , All Stop ... let 's get this mess sorted out .
tr	3	I said , " Point taken , you 're right , we haven 't tried that one yet .
tr	0	Maybe we could hang a trapeze in that big live oak over there , play Tarzan and Jane . "
tr	0	Connie and I about jumped out of our skins as the airplane flashed by at masthead level .
tr	1	I looked at Connie and said ; " Feel like making a trip to Pierson . "
tr	2	After introductions , I found out he had flown all the way from Kentucky to come to Astor .
tr	3	He came back to the houseboat with us and that night told us of his ordeal .
tr	4	She did and was immediately accepted ; both Sam and Joyce would be making the trip with us .
tr	1	Connie remarked having Sam along was going to be like turning a bull loose in the china closet .
tr	3	She said , " I 've got the pistol in my purse that should tell you something . "
tr	0	Jimmy 's always been a bride 's maid and he 's past due having his own command .
tr	1	I had no doubt that serving under Jim and Herb would round off any remaining rough edges .
tr	1	I was always suspicious of engineering officers who didn 't have dirt or grease under their fingernails .
tr	2	Cindy asked , " Captain , do you know where we 're going , and for how long ? "
tr	2	I have no idea how long were going to be gone ... rumor is three or four months .
tr	1	I put in requisitions for things like rods , pistons , bearings , and valves but have gotten nowhere .
tr	0	Captain Bright called you guys my left and right arms and that 's the way I 'll be .
tr	0	I wasted no time Dan was already scrounging parts , Herb had requisitioned ammunition and was overseeing its storage .
tr	4	This was a misnomer as some of the strongest and smartest people I have known are women .
tr	1	Next item , I will not tolerate any sexual harassment or intimidation on this ship , military or non-military .
tr	2	Herb said , " No problem he 's a likable guy I 'll find him plenty to do . "
tr	3	She said , " That 's a great comeback even better knowing it 's the truth .
tr	4	Maybe you believed I was doing it out of civic mindedness or I harbored some latent lust for adventure .
tr	2	This is supposed to be fact finding mission , for that you need boots on the ground .
tr	2	OK , get out of here ; I know you got things to take care of .
tr	2	Don 't forget the cookout Sunday afternoon and for your information , there will be real beef steaks ! "
tr	1	I don 't want to know how sneaky and underhanded you get just don 't kill anybody , please .
tr	1	I want you to give Ensign Sanchez a daily report on how things are going . "
tr	0	All I can say , you did in a day and a half what should have taken weeks . "
tr	2	I noticed on one of my trips around base that the mushroom lay abandoned next to a workshop .
tr	2	We built a Sunbrella fence around it , looks like part of the boat folds out-of-the-way in seconds .
tr	1	I said , " If anything comes up I 'll certainly let you know right away . "
tr	3	I 'd better not forget I was the one who had instigated this charade in the first place .
tr	3	I didn 't relish the thought of dragging the crap all the way to Key West .
tr	4	When they were assembled , I said , " Ladies , gentlemen once again welcome aboard Pisces .
tr	1	My only ambition then was to chase women , lay around drunk , and fade into oblivion .
tr	3	Anyway from what I could learn it sounds like they pretty well got their shit together .
tr	2	I invited them on board ; we shook hands all around and had them conducted to the conference room .
tr	1	Captain , I have to live with myself knowing I may have participated in genocide . "
tr	1	I warned Herb , no one gets trigger-happy on my ship , and this isn 't a hunting expedition .
tr	0	She said , curtly , " Captain that would be Ms. Abernathy if you please . "
tr	1	I scanned with the glasses but could find no sign of human activity just desolation and overgrown ruins .
tr	2	I was impressed as they had asked only for tools to gather food rather than food itself .
tr	2	The cook set up and was preparing racks of ribs for the cookout as late afternoon approached .
tr	0	Carol had been talking with them and had asked if they would take her and Cindy ashore .
tr	3	" Good I want this ship ready to get under way at a moment 's notice .
tr	0	I 'm placing you in charge and giving you all the resources we have available starting now . "
tr	0	The mob on shore was focused on the drifting boat which had almost reached the shore .
tr	0	I gave Cindy and Ms. Abernathy a couple of days before I had a talk with them .
tr	4	He said , " Let Jackson come alone but he will be required to surrender his side arm . "
tr	4	If Ensign Jackson was to be effective , he would have to have some way to keep in contact .
tr	4	There was something odd in the way he said run which immediately raised a red flag .
tr	1	I gazed at the bay where Pisces was swinging at anchor looking like a sitting duck .
tr	0	What I needed was an old cruiser and a company or two of marines , damn you Allan Bright .
tr	1	Linda and Jeff sat in the back seat carrying on a conversation drifting in and out of Spanish .
tr	1	I had Linda standing by to translate , but Mr. Vella had no trouble turning a word in English .
tr	4	This seemed to please him , we talked for a while longer and the meeting came to an end .
tr	1	" Thanks , Linda good job ; say would you mind attending dinner with us Saturday evening . "
tr	3	I could then contact Allan and have him pass it on to Washington and let them sort it out .
tr	1	I may have unwittingly played right into his hands by diverting the supply ship and tanker to come here .
tr	3	I said , " Linda that 's going a little beyond the call of duty . "
tr	1	She said , " I didn 't consider it to be a hardship , sir . "
tr	3	I said , " That 's a bold plan how does he intend to carry it out ? "
tr	4	You probably don 't know that Vella was a key player in the drug trade before the troubles .
tr	3	" Captain I 'm sorry but I couldn 't tip my hand not even to you .
tr	1	I said , " Morning Dennis , pour yourself a cup and join the party ... .
tr	0	The trap was baited now to get back to the ship and send Allan a secure explanation .
tr	1	Unfortunately , we 'll be kicking the can down the road and leaving young Jeff hung out to dry .
tr	3	Next day I sent the invitation RSVP to Mr. Vella the following morning it was accepted .
tr	1	" I said , Vella give it up or you 'll never get off this ship alive . "
tr	2	Can you truly condemn this young woman whom you love so much to her death , I think not ?
tr	0	I could well understand how Helen of Troy had caused the launching of a thousand ships .
tr	4	Sam said , " GW you don 't give me orders , get going were wasting time . "
tr	2	He replied , " Captain she 's my fucking ship now , you just worry about that blood . "
tr	1	The guns on Morro switched targets and there was a splash 200 yards from the ship .
tr	0	The Coast Guard station was almost in view as the diesel again started missing and died .
tr	1	Thankfully she was young and strong and though it was painful with no anesthetics , she was recovering nicely .
tr	4	Pisces was now tied up to a wharf for the first time since leaving Key West .
tr	4	With Vella gone decent people came forward to participate in the beginnings of a proper government .
tr	3	I wrote out a long report to Allan and sent it back with the supply ship captain .
tr	1	I had visited three islands each was distinctive in how it had come through the Collapse .
tr	1	Besides it was interesting as each island was in its own way a unique little microcosm .
tr	0	Once that infrastructure was damaged , people were forced to turn to what was available locally .
tr	0	Late afternoon approached Sam pulled in the anchor and we started on our way back to the ship .
tr	3	Dusk turned into night we kept a lookout expecting any minute to see the inflatable 's running lights .
tr	2	The GPS Chart plotter was functioning for a change and I worked out a rough estimate of our course .
tr	2	Our present rate of drift was such that we would close the coast sometime tomorrow afternoon .
tr	4	Gerald had been our last chance and as the chopper vanished so did any hope of quickly being found .
tr	2	The road runs along the coast there 's a couple of town 's you 'll have to bypass .
tr	4	Remember don 't wait , take off if we can we 'll catch up with you . "
tr	4	I headed straight out into the bay hoping they would think we were making for open water .
tr	0	With Sam and I leading the way , we cautiously walked ashore weapons at the ready .
tr	4	We found enough heavy duty extension cords to reach from the generator 's batteries to the boat .
tr	2	We sat in the spacious living room enjoying the cool of the air conditioning discussing our good fortune .
tr	0	Connie and Joyce had been busy all day packing away food and the other stuff they had scavenged .
tr	1	Connie and Joyce found a working washer and dryer and had been busy doing up everything in the boat .
tr	0	Sam and I roamed the island and even stumbled across a couple of full propane tanks for the grill .
tr	3	She said , " Your all little boys underneath when it comes to putting temptation in your path . "
tr	1	I said , " That 's what I like about girls you 're such crafty devils .
tr	4	Your right Sam has mellowed out considerably from the old days and I 'd hate to see him backslide .
tr	4	The boat had been well-taken care of , almost every system on board had been replaced or upgraded .
tr	1	We spent a lot of time lounging in the cockpit under the bimini discussing life in general .
tr	2	Sam asked me how come I started out in the Navy and wound up doing archeology .
tr	2	I told Sam and Joyce to stay alert and cautioned them not to allow anyone on board .
tr	4	Connie and I took the dingy , rigged the sail , and headed into the Custom 's wharf .
tr	1	" No I can 't take credit ; Sam did it all on his own . "
tr	2	Jim disobeyed orders ... George you ruined a good officer when you taught Jimmy how to think for himself .
tr	3	Sam said , " Got a good point , I still can 't believe they did that . "
tr	0	He said , " Captain I 'm ready to turn command of Pisces back to you . "
tr	2	" I would ask you to humor an old man by allowing me to issue one last order .
tr	2	I 'll request an official command change from Allan , I 'm sure he 'll concur . "
tr	2	Connie and I said good-bye , to Claude and promised we would be back to dig in the ruins .
tr	3	I was going to the miss the ketch it would be hard going back to little Surreal .
tr	0	We could no longer compete and American manufacturing in the traditional form was a thing of the past .
tr	4	Just keep in mind , the government no longer serves its citizens but has been bought by big business .
tr	3	I don 't have to defend this statement the government has a long track record to back it up .
tr	4	No one wanted to pause and contemplate that maybe real estate prices were bordering on the insane .
tr	0	Again the bubble burst leaving the small banks and the savings and loans hung out to dry .
tr	1	Cable news is just as much of a sham as most have become bias spouting only the party line .
tr	3	It was touted to the public as a golden opportunity to open up new markets in Mexico and Canada .
tr	0	I am sixth generation American yet I can 't for all intents and purposes call myself a Native American .
tr	1	Maybe this is oversimplified but it 's a good litmus test when deciding on the worthiness of a candidate .
tr	3	The guy pumping the septic tank is just as important as the people manufacturing or selling the toilet .
tr	4	The likelihood is as the world population grows this trend will continue eventually overtaking even first world countries .
tr	2	The economy is not just about numbers but flesh and blood , hopes , and dreams .
tr	1	The ability to read and write WELL is imperative as it is the basis for all other learning .
tr	0	Back in the day , family and community as well as school shaped a child 's demeanor .
tr	2	No longer could an adult or even a parent scold a child 's wrongdoing for fear of reprisal .
tr	2	It is any wonder the prison population continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of society .
tr	2	Unfortunately , not all kids will do well in school , the dropout rates reflect this .
tr	3	I hate to use the term rotten apple for only a tiny handful truly fall into this category .
tr	1	Innovation in this area is the way to make sure that no child is left behind .
tr	3	Don 't attempt to skew learning in order to make it conform to current political correctness .
tr	4	Every attempt at warping young people 's minds backfires and comes home to roost in ways we never envision .
tr	3	Then there are the artisans who with their hands turn ideas into glorious works of art .
tr	0	Concentrate on wind , solar , switch grass , algae , wave machines , cow manure , anything .
tr	2	I mumble , you hypocritical bastard you want to put my standard of living in jeopardy , not yours .
tr	3	What really happened with most HMOs were the immediate attempts at cost cutting and the limiting of choice .
tr	2	Cut out the crap of " ask your doctor if X is right for you . "
tr	1	Final thoughts I find in reading through what I have written that there is an air of pervasive pessimism .
tr	1	It ventures into several fields and disciplines of which I have only a rudimentary understanding of basic principals .
tr	3	It is intentionally written in the broadest and simplest terms in order to encompass the subject .
tr	4	I looked at where mankind is today and the role he will likely play in the near future .
tr	3	First that it is purely serendipitous for the planet that we have evolved independently to confront this threat .
tr	3	Nature has brought man to his current stage of evolution and equipped us for the task of initial exploration .
tr	4	Deaf , dumb , and blind creatures grappling with existence ever trying to better cope with their surroundings .
tr	4	Most creatures settled into their lineage and whatever intelligence they developed was used for day-to-day activities .
tr	3	The foremost attribute or instinct shared by all living things seems to be the will to survive and propagate .
tr	4	In the end he had evolved an upright stance and the opposed thumb along with a large brain .
tr	4	All of these weaknesses forced him to develop ever-increasing brainpower and later tools to help overcome these deficiencies .
tr	0	He thus was forced to search for better things with which to provide him with cover .
tr	1	Ultimately it led him to develop reason to work in groups and create societies and civilizations .
tr	0	The village chieftain traditionally had larger quarters than the rest of the villagers with additional rooms for close family .
tr	2	She looked at him from the window , " as though there is nothing to be concerned about . "
tr	2	You 'll be gone soon on the hunt so you might as well enjoy it while you can . "
tr	2	Their orders were no one was to be spared , no man , no woman no child .
tr	2	" Don 't call me Corp you moron , what time of the morning do you call this ? "
tr	1	Funny how they don 't mind giving up rank when they join ' The Regiment ' , he thought .
tr	3	" Yes I know that George but what was it actually like ... the going ? "
tr	2	Sit yourself down there 's a couple of things I want to run by you . "
tr	2	Gema looked up her lips tight , it was obvious she was fighting to control herself .
tr	2	Sorry I was a bit short with you just now , got a lot on my mind . "
tr	1	" No worries sir , " said George smiling , " what 's happening with the other thing ? "
tr	2	One way or another you 'll be going in , just a question of when ... ... .
tr	4	by the way the Colonel is involved , called me about it this morning ... ... .
tr	4	Rather than see her , or hear her for that matter , he sensed her presence at his side .
tr	3	Didn 't want to tell her what he came down to the beach to tell her .
tr	2	Wilkinson was a tall , blonde haired officer who looked young enough to be still in school .
tr	3	His blue tunic had the top button undone like a fighter pilot of the last war .
tr	2	" Thanks Flight Officer , great job , you 've saved us a load of trouble and effort .
tr	2	" As usual the map 's no bloody good to man nor beast , " whispered Downer .
tr	0	Driving the Champion back to HQ he was a happy man , at least she hadn 't said no .
tr	1	He occasionally made notes in the margins in order to get clarification from Jennings when he came on duty .
tr	4	" My home , my parents , my brother , " she sobbed , " what has happened ? "
tr	0	" It 's probably just propaganda , I 'm sure your family is okay , " he whispered .
tr	2	" Oh my God , " thought Dickie , " the bloody photos are still on the wall ! "
tr	1	Each in jungle fatigues , no insignias , no rank , nothing that would identify them .
tr	4	No personal effects , no labels , supplies for two weeks with little chance of re-supply .
tr	2	Harry , on point , soon found a thicket that afforded a good view and excellent concealment .
tr	1	gazed out into the compound periodically scanning the area with his binoculars particularly in the direction of the river .
tr	2	" Good , " said Mudd , " we 'll be back in four to six hours .
tr	2	We 've been here over forty hours and it looks as though nothing 's going on .
tr	2	George took a number of shots , from different angles and a close up of the tattoos .
tr	2	George first took photos of the brass laying on the ground whilst Peter cast around looking for more .
tr	3	" I 'm with you on that , " said Peter , " the ground is pretty soft . "
tr	2	Half way home , Peter dug into his pocket and took out one of the shell casings .
tr	2	The house responded with silence , that sort of hollow sound that tells you nobody 's in .
tr	4	" Might as well have a small one before she comes home , " he thought .
tr	1	Damn it if it wasn 't for him she 'd still be in Sarawak working as a government interpreter .
tr	3	Even now they didn 't get invited too often to functions that required a partner in tow .
tr	4	We 'll only be gone for a few weeks , it 'll be a wonderful experience for her .
tr	1	Her planned itinerary took them from London to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Kuching in Sarawak .
tr	1	No compass just his native instinct , his bare feet seemingly impervious to what was underfoot ... .
tr	0	He passed her the package wrapped in traditional leaves , unwrapping it she found a small blanket .
tr	3	Her mother had treated her blisters from the first aid kit but they 'd only just started to heal .
tr	0	Her clothes in the laundry hamper , did he know how to run the washing machine ?
tr	4	like he said , " almost like going back home except for the shortage of pubs . "
tr	3	It was one of the few clubs that accepted ' Asians ' he thought cynically ... .
tr	1	" For sure , " said Dick , " me , George , Harry and Faulkner .
tr	4	If there 's a tie there 'll be sudden death like last time , gorgeous day for it . "
tr	2	" St John 's Wood actually , " said Tony laughing , his voice very cultured .
tr	3	" That 's a good start , " said Harry , " usually George is off to the right .
tr	4	The game progressed well , accompanied by the usual banter shared by people who play a lot of golf .
tr	3	At the turn Tony was up by a couple of shots on the rest of them .
tr	3	" I know , " said Harry , " not worth making a thing about it though .
tr	1	He looked around him in disgust , two Sikhs in turbans , pints in hand having a heated discussion .
tr	3	Tony sat down , slightly at an angle to Avi , but still able to see the door .
tr	0	Call and see if they have a vacancy and have one of our chaps stay over .
tr	1	" I think I left it in my desk in the study , " he replied .
tr	3	Maybe I 've eaten something that 's upset my stomach , I might throw up . "
tr	3	In the twenty short minutes it took to drive to the lodge she imposed her will .
tr	0	He had hardly changed , if anything he had lost weight , he looked tanned and fit .
tr	4	the odd hug , men who had shared danger together meeting for the first time in years .
tr	4	The kid keyed his speed dial , " He 's heading for the gym for sure .
tr	2	You either won or you lost , the other guy lying on the canvas bloodied and beaten .
tr	2	Tony slipped out of the way on his toes and waited for what he knew was coming .
tr	2	The crowd started to boo as Tony had not followed through while the brawler was down .
tr	1	Tony showered , changed back into his jeans and waited for Avi in the changing room .
tr	2	" Bloody expensive , " said Tony , " a lot of people have to be paid off .
tr	3	Probably cost at least twice maybe three times what they would on the normal market . "
tr	3	" Bout bloody time , " he thought , as he walked up the two flights of stairs .
tr	3	" The best way to do this is just go round the table , " said the Commander .
tr	0	" That 'll teach you to be a naughty boy Dave , " said the Commander smiling at him .
tr	3	" If you keep breaking the rules and taking short cuts it 's bound to catch up with you .
tr	2	" No reason why not , might have to go down to Ledbury some time though . "
tr	1	It was quite naked and lying on its back , arms straight by its side ... ... .
tr	1	This entire thing is staged , whoever did it wanted him to be found like this .
tr	0	" I 'm afraid , as of now , I can 't answer all your questions .
tr	3	We took the prints and ran them through our own data base but nothing came up .
tr	4	Again we 've sent them down to London see if they can come up with something .
tr	3	I cut a few corners , got sick of the bureaucracy , the bullshit , it tied my hands .
tr	1	" No such things as coincidences , " thought David , " thinking like that gets you killed . "
tr	3	Tony was in there for approximately an hour then left , driving straight back to London .
tr	4	In case you don 't know , Jen , Tern Hill is the headquarters of the Irish Regiment .
tr	2	Marjorie came in carrying the tray and noticed him looking carefully at some of the photos .
tr	2	Lord knows what 's going to become of it now , perhaps I can sell it . "
tr	1	Their old CO lives in Hereford , that 's Captain Mason , Dickie to his friends .
tr	2	She followed him into a drawing room filled with light from the tall windows overlooking a paddock .
tr	2	" Not yet , " she replied , " we 're still waiting for the toxicology report from London .
tr	4	I have a couple of customers in the North Sea but my largest customer is in Brunei .
tr	0	Gema had been away for a couple of weeks and wasn 't due back for another couple of days .
tr	4	Dickie busied himself at work but wasn 't as happy at the golf course as he had been before .
tr	2	Sorry to get you out of bed but something has come up which you need to know about .
tr	2	* " My oh my just look at you , " said David , " you 've got legs !
tr	0	" I see what you mean , " said David , " place must have cost a bloody fortune .
tr	2	David was the first to speak , " How did he die , did they say anything ? "
tr	0	David had walked over to the wall and was looking at the machete type blades on the wall .
tr	1	" None of this is coincidence , " said David , " it 's all inter-connected .
tr	1	The concern was the obvious link to Indonesia and their pasts in the jungles of Borneo .
tr	2	He stood up , stretched , walked over to the window and looked across the courtyard to the barn .
tr	2	Gema 's Jag was parked out front and a yellow light shone from one of the windows .
tr	0	Dick watched the shadowy shape rhythmically slide in front of the window lit solely by the firelight .
tr	1	" Which brings us to two issues I want to discuss with you Commander , " said David seriously .
tr	4	He owns a security business with branches both here in England and in the Far East .
tr	0	Although he was a little early he found Paddy in the snug wrapped around a Guinness .
tr	3	" Hmmmm , " said the Commander thoughtfully , " that 's actually a pretty good idea .
tr	3	Now it looked better than it had originally , it was worth it just to listen to the exhaust .
tr	0	She had a slight smile on her face , her short auburn hair blowing in the wind .
tr	4	he shouted over the wind , " I can put the top up if you like . "
tr	4	Once the formalities were out of the way George suggested he show her around a bit .
tr	0	" Yes I had it custom engraved , it 's a real work of art . "
tr	3	At first she couldn 't hit a thing but she slowly got the hang of it .
tr	1	Judy was the first soft thing in my life , if you know what I mean .
tr	2	Rob wanted to come home and get involved , I talked him out of it though . "
tr	3	He called the dogs in , got out of his boots and went into the study .
tr	4	They talked of her life as an army wife , her knowledge of both Harry Downer and Peter Brenner .
tr	3	I 'd have to talk to him first anyway otherwise he wouldn 't tell you a thing . "
tr	4	Sounded like a good , pragmatic step except she couldn 't remember what time they eventually fell asleep .
tr	3	I forgot to tell you that bit , " he said laughing , " usually pretty early too . "
tr	1	" I 'm going to put him on speaker phone Jen and turn on the scrambler .
tr	4	He had bought the bench some years prior and came to sit several times a month .
tr	3	The base of the headstone was a riot of color although starting to fade now with the waning year .
tr	2	There are no secrets ... ... she knows all about you and now you know about her .
tr	1	Later I will bring her to visit ... ... if she wants to of course . "
tr	2	I promise to find out what happened as they would for me , I know you understand . "
tr	4	" It can be done ... expensive but possible ... ... all a matter of timing . "
tr	3	* It was crisp that morning with the type of blue sky that heralds a really cold snap .
tr	3	St. Mary 's is in Market Drayton , after that he just went back to Clive Barracks . "
tr	4	If her car 's there , she drives a green Jaguar , we know she 's home .
tr	1	I 'd like him to come and it 's quite a while since he was in England .
tr	0	The guard in the guardhouse at the main entrance waved him through and wished him a Merry Xmas also .
tr	1	David and Jennie were sitting in the Dragon enjoying a pint after a day of paperwork .
tr	4	He had a feeling of space and risked shining the light a little off the floor .
tr	4	Checking that the road was clear in both directions he tapped twice on the side of the van .
tr	4	The van accelerated through the demolished gate and turned in the direction of the QM stores .
tr	4	" Jesus Christ we don 't even know how many people were involved never mind who they were . "
tr	4	Get hold of George Mudd I want him there and get an inventory from Tern Hill .
tr	1	It 's obvious that the strike was both professional , surgical and required inside information . "
tr	2	The one on his right bent down to his ear , " Good evening John , how are you ?
tr	3	It had started to snow and the wind was threatening to drift the snow against the buildings .
tr	2	The other options I leave to your imagination , are you sure you won 't have some tea ? "
tr	0	John 's scream was drowned out by the crash of the chair as it hit the floor .
tr	2	Lie him down on the floor and get the poor chap a pillow for his head . "
tr	2	Of course his final option would be just to cut and run , but to where ?
tr	4	Most of the guys jogged on the base using either the track or the playing fields .
tr	4	The Commander looked up , " we have to assume that Jennings and Wei are up to no good .
tr	1	We can 't afford any communication between them or we run the risk of them running .
tr	1	George ... ... as far as the Irish side is concerned it 's not that difficult .
tr	2	I presume you have no objection to our interviewing Tony Wei once you have him in custody ? "
tr	4	thanks for asking , " she replied laughing , " but there 's a couple of conditions .
tr	0	When the Commander and David arrived communications was manned by an SAS Captain and one trooper .
tr	2	The operation should be pretty straight forward although , of course , you never really know .
tr	3	" Blue Team you are good to go , " said the Captain quietly into his throat mike .
tr	2	take a look at this Commander " Looking down into the crates they saw four automatic weapons .
tr	0	The two men had their shotguns under their arms although it looked as though they 'd had no luck .
tr	3	The bloody turkey only just fits in the Aga and there 's only ten of us ! "
tr	1	I 'm afraid our gift is rather small by comparison but I know you 'll like it . "
tr	1	I was getting a bit panicky , " said George , " just be careful with it ... . .
tr	4	Inside , the shotgun with the four sets of barrels lay gleaming in the green felt compartments .
tr	3	Stitched into the inside of the lid the leather tab proclaiming to the world ... . . '
tr	2	" Bloody Hell , " said George , " that 's a turn up for the book . "
tr	3	They went down to breakfast ... ... not the pine table in the kitchen this morning .
tr	1	Robbie , all six foot four of him , was dressed in his traditional Highland Dress .
tr	1	His eighteen yard kilt swayed as he strode across the room giving Jennie a Christmas kiss .
tr	1	" You and Terry sit down , " said George , " I do the serving this morning . "
tr	3	A few lines about the eyes but her hair was still lustrous although now it was cut short .
tr	2	" You must be Robbie McElroy , I 'm Wendy Mason I 've heard so much about you . "
tr	3	I don 't know what it is but there 's something in the air ... ... . .
tr	4	When he was offed we had all the players under surveillance so there 's someone we 've missed .
tr	2	Merry Christmas ... ... sorry to get you up early on Boxing Day but something 's come up .
tr	2	I don 't know for how long could be a month or so ... ... . .
tr	2	I 'm going up to London for the day tomorrow but should be back by Friday .
tr	1	" What a magnificent old church , " said Jennie her breath curling up into the air .
tr	3	It 's so important that it was removed during the war and stored for safekeeping . "
tr	2	They were walking on what was obviously a pathway , snow covered now ... ... . .
tr	1	" Thank you , " she said , " I was waiting for you to bring me here . "
tr	3	As they got closer to the city the conditions improved and the skies started to clear .
tr	4	George would act as an observer although he was the only one who had actually met Wei previously .
tr	1	" The fact is , Jen , we really don 't know what 's going on .
tr	4	He then turned into the driveway of a large detached house set back from the road .
tr	4	" I 'll leave it in the safe as soon as my itchy feeling disappears . "
tr	0	He was outwardly calm , he 'd shaved that morning and looked clean and well turned out .
tr	3	With all that you 'll be lucky to see the light of day again in this lifetime . "
tr	0	He sat on the window seat gazing across the yard at the barn and Gema 's flat .
tr	4	He was developing more of a paunch and he was definitely getting a little thin on top .
tr	1	It was driving him crazy , slightly muffled , high pitched and incessant ... ... demanding .
tr	3	Whatever it was it was still stationary in the woods beyond the paddock to the south of the house .
tr	4	Although they were aware of the system they were still not yet aware of each individual location .
tr	3	" I might be getting old , " he thought " but I ain 't dead yet . "
tr	2	Terry inched forward through the snow visually casting to both sides looking for some sort of human sign .
tr	4	He seems more pissed that somebody was able to jump him rather than worrying about his head . "
tr	3	Rafferty scared the shit out of me at the gate , Robbie I want to talk to you . "
tr	0	" Not sure what it all means but thanks anyway , what else is going on ? "
tr	1	Jennie had had just about enough of this woman her patience was running a little thin .
tr	4	As she stood by the carousel waiting for her bag her startling blue eyes took in her surroundings .
tr	0	George you obviously already know but he is also attached to the same task force as a consultant .
tr	3	I ' m sure you will understand that he has a lot to bring to the table .
tr	2	You are one of the common denominators , one of the links so hopefully you can help us . "
tr	0	Gema sat at the table staring at George 's back as he watched the rain running down the window .
tr	3	" It 's of little importance Gema ... bit of a shot in the dark . "
tr	0	" The rain has stopped at least , " he said to no one in particular .
tr	1	In Indonesia there 's a form of martial arts called Silat which originated with the tribes in the interior .
tr	1	she didn 't tell us anything we don 't already know , any ideas anyone ? "
tr	4	Halfway home he pulled over to the side of the road and rummaged about in his briefcase .
tr	0	Two forensic trucks , Gema 's Jag , Jens car and a Panda police car filled up the space .
tr	2	Looking up , the exposed beams of the original barn roof could be seen in the gloom .
tr	2	Two of the walls were solid sheets of glass looking out onto farmland , now veiled in grey rain .
tr	1	" Fair warning ... she 's spitting bullets about our search ... can 't blame her I suppose .
tr	2	Knocking on the door and not getting any response he pushed open the door and walked into the room .
tr	4	" I am your friend Gema and I don 't believe you 've actually done anything .
tr	3	She took the photo and taking it over to one of the lamps she held it in the light .
tr	4	As they drove into the village in the Land Rover Jen could see that George had been quite right .
tr	4	The Commander sat at the head of the table , Jen , David and George down one side .
tr	2	" Jen it 's actually less of a worry now if our conclusions are correct , " said George .
tr	4	I think we have an opportunity here but we have to take a much broader view .
tr	3	She admitted that she thought they were from Kalimantan but that 's as far as she went . "
tr	1	Jen you stay in Hereford for now , perhaps start catching up on the paper work .
tr	4	She fully expected to eventually receive a call from George concerning the stunning photo he had shown her .
tr	0	Her mind raced at the thought of meeting the person who owned the hands in the old photograph .
tr	1	I 'm sticking out like a sore thumb and Rafferty is still driving around looking for somewhere to park .
tr	4	Jimmy 's mobile rang on the bedside table in the small hotel just around the corner .
tr	3	" Not so difficult , " she thought , " either that or they 're not very good . "
tr	1	Gema sat in the lobby of the Holiday Inn facing the main entrance nursing a coffee and croissant .
tr	2	David stood in the middle of the lobby looking at Gema with a look of horror .
tr	4	Placing the pistol in her briefcase and using Robert 's keys she opened the door into the living room .
tr	1	She walked into the living room , said something to Tony Wei sitting in front of an electric fire .
tr	0	Jennie had wound the tape back yet again and was focused on Gema as the action unfolded .
tr	4	There is no advantage or disadvantage to me killing you so don 't make me make the choice . "
tr	3	He put his wrists in front of him and she tied them up using duct tape .
tr	0	She disappeared into the garage and came back a few moments later with a large folded tarp .
tr	2	~ ~ ~ Chapter 43 Family David arrived the following morning looking none the worse for wear .
tr	3	She told me it wouldn 't hurt , that I would just go to sleep for a while .
tr	3	There was the sound of a shot and the rattling of the phone as it hit the floor .
tr	3	It might fade with time but , with a little scratching , would easily come to the surface .
tr	2	She had fallen on the bedroom floor , Mrs. Thompson 's gun and the phone close by .
tr	2	Robbie 's going to hang around for a few days then he 'll be going back to Brunei .
tr	3	" I thought you liked me just for my red hair and other attributes , " she said laughing .
tr	2	* " Robbie before you scoot back to Bandar how 'd you like to drive down to Brecon ?
tr	2	He stood up slowly holding his arm and looked at his attacker who was closer now .
tr	3	He was fighting for breath and it felt as though at least two ribs were broken .
tr	0	He looked at her , holding his arm and breathing shallowly ... ... she was close to death .
tr	2	He stood up , " Trooper Mac will be okay soon , I boiled the sugar off . "
tr	2	To Mary C. Findley who helped with the proof reading and polishing of this , my first book .
tr	1	It was a cloudless , sunny day with a definite bite of cold in the air .
tr	4	But it had tested their endurance and their faith in the Hand of Providence and in each other .
tr	4	† † † September 12 , 1621 We have finally arrived on the ship Armando on our long-awaited journey .
tr	4	Careful , maybe , with only a slight smile on the handsome face caused by her continuous chatter .
tr	3	But her constant chatter put a smile on his face and by lunch he talked to her softly .
tr	1	She is too much of a lady for riff-raff to speak of her in that fashion .
tr	4	I heard there was trouble with the game and the Captain warned him to be careful around the sailors .
tr	2	We got to talk for a while before she had to go back into the hold .
tr	0	This lady , a woman of noble birth , loves me , an ordinary sailor man .
tr	4	In my arms today she was far from the " ice queen " others have called her .
tr	0	She searched for him all day but I simply had no heart to tell her the truth .
tr	1	But tonight I will give him his greatest gift when I reveal my pregnancy to him .
tr	3	He had taught them to read the stars at night , to read charts , navigating their own way .
tr	0	Manuel had a gentle and caring heart that made him loveable and accessible to the villagers .
tr	3	It sounded foreign and distant to them , just stories they had heard all their lives .
tr	4	She did not notice the familiar faces , townspeople who waved at her and flashed toothy smiles .
tr	1	" Yes child , I have news , but it is not good news , I am afraid . "
tr	2	Jumping down off a barrel in one swift motion , he followed them at a slow pace .
tr	4	Her mother held a cloth on the leg , trying to stop the bleeding , pale with worry .
tr	0	He assured me that you are a wealthy man and can pay me a healthy ransom for his release .
tr	0	I had nothing else to say and I wrapped her in my arms and held her all night .
tr	0	Amen 2 January 2 , 1624 We spent our first Christmas and New Year together as a family .
tr	1	" Yes , dear , I will bring the coins to you in a moment . "
tr	0	He was the pillar and he would be the pillar as always , her giant Papa .
tr	2	Come tomorrow morning , fear would be the last emotion she had the luxury of giving into .
tr	3	Because of her I had the courage to do what I did to get us out of that place .
tr	0	3 January 15 , 1624 Today was an exceptionally cold day and we spent it indoors .
tr	0	Today I think back to the many days and weeks we walked through the grassy plains of Africa .
tr	3	I remember the exhaustion , the heat , and the insects that bit us day and night .
tr	0	I learned to eat anything in my walk , from tree bark to grass and leaves .
tr	1	The Falcon is definitely going to know her , but there is no harm in having some fun .
tr	4	Two men stood with buckets filled with sea water and splashed it over the wooden deck .
tr	3	Many of them watched her with curiosity , toothy grins on their faces , talking to one another .
tr	0	The man on his right-hand side was rather good looking , with a smile on his handsome face .
tr	4	She realized she needed a place to put them and , looked around her room a second time .
tr	4	The scar running from his left eye to the corner of his mouth made him look fierce .
tr	4	" I understand from my chamber boy that I will not be served any meals ? "
tr	1	For a moment she was at a loss for words , her fists white as she clenched them .
tr	3	" I must point out that this is my father 's ship , Señor , and not yours . "
tr	0	† † † January 25 , 1624 I cannot believe I am already a month on the estate .
tr	1	Franco is patient with all my one hundred questions , answering them as we go along .
tr	0	Kayla was at it again , and like a fool I only believed what I wanted to believe .
tr	4	She decided to go to the upper deck to dry her hair in the midday sun .
tr	2	She could look far around her , the west coast of Africa noticeable on the horizon .
tr	1	Finally , when the evening bell announced the dinner , she was once again aware of her surroundings .
tr	4	Pierre , the chief mate , Alexi , Enrico and two other men sat around her .
tr	4	He could see himself on a farm with her by his side , building a future with her .
tr	1	And for this lady sitting across from him , he was willing to give it up .
tr	4	From the very first moment he saw her , he knew they were meant to meet .
tr	1	Roberto had seen women broken emotionally and physically by the Falcon and to see this woman in his hands ?
tr	0	It was touch and go for a moment and I really thought that was where we all would die .
tr	1	This is much to Cisco 's delight , but he demands that I rest as often as possible .
tr	4	My heart was in turmoil because I knew I could not leave Cisco and never see him again .
tr	0	From that day forward Cisco and Faro became friends until Faro 's death at sea weeks later .
tr	2	" Your brother has told me a lot of stories about what you endured during your adventures into Africa .
tr	3	" The wind was cold and it felt like it wanted to tear the skin from our faces .
tr	3	The fear that gripped us was so real that I cried tears mingled with the salty water .
tr	2	Back then he was only a sailor who owed us nothing but his care for us .
tr	4	A soft sob left her mouth and she stopped talking the emotions very intense in her .
tr	2	His own control broke and without thinking , he placed an arm around the soft , delicate shoulders .
tr	4	This time he was closer to her and she could see tenderness and understanding in his face .
tr	0	" He is a great man and father , and a great husband to my mother .
tr	1	Their hands met and he folded hers into his warm grasp , bringing it to his lips .
tr	4	Stunned by the intimate gesture , shivers went up her spine , but she could only watch him .
tr	1	† † † April 18 , 1624 Today I held my son in my arms for the first time .
tr	0	Through it all we had to hope that help would come or that we would find a safe haven .
tr	4	He looked around him with piercing grey eyes , missing nothing " Where are you going ? "
tr	4	Today we relived many of the moments we shared with them in the wilderness of Africa .
tr	4	Kayla remembered the time that one of the chiefs hunted us and we had to hide .
tr	3	Two slave woman that still had enough fat on them said they would stay and this pleased the chief .
tr	4	It seemed that they were headed for the islands of Cape Verde , islands Roberto knew very well .
tr	0	His bet was that they would anchor at the island of Santiago , a place he would investigate .
tr	4	By the time lunch was served , clouds had begun to accumulate in the clear sky .
tr	3	It did not matter how brave or strong she was , the upcoming storm would devastate her .
tr	4	" We better hope it will give us enough time to bring her back safely before it hits . "
tr	2	It was after eight , so dark you could hardly see your hand in front of your face .
tr	0	She lay in the shadows with her back to the wooden wall and stacks of bags around her .
tr	0	No guards present in a ship of that size and I really found it alarming . "
tr	4	The threatening clouds had finally released their waters the moment they had stepped back on deck .
tr	3	Tied to the bed pulling at the restrains , she tried to move , but could not .
tr	4	She could only stare at him as she wet her drying lips , reliving the past twenty-four hours .
tr	2	" Did you for one moment think that I would not notice that you were gone ? "
tr	2	" Because you want to be a sailor I am going to treat you like one . "
tr	4	Before she could react he barked out , " Take her to the upper deck . "
tr	1	Roberto walked over to her and ripped her shirt from her back , exposing her soft , silky skin .
tr	3	The woman was still tied against the railing , struggling to loosen herself from the bonds .
tr	1	" Then it makes sense what we saw : no guards and only drunken men . "
tr	0	I was so afraid that I went and took cover in the safest place I could find .
tr	4	I can only hope that somewhere in that pirate heart of yours you will see the wisdom in it .
tr	2	Roberto looked at him with a glimmer of a smile , but kept his voice low .
tr	2	When I looked at it , his fingerprint dent was still showing on the coast of Morocco .
tr	2	I had to make a path for the remaining group on our way to the fort .
tr	3	We stayed for a day helping the last six to gain some strength but it was not enough .
tr	0	The strain of carrying them and making a path was too much for my own weak body .
tr	4	He could not believe how vulnerable he was before her , kneeling in front of her .
tr	0	He wanted to pull her closer , his body aching for her warmth next to him .
tr	3	But he found it was more than just attraction or thoughts of a few minutes rolling in the hay .
tr	2	His life foretold an unsavoury future , a life no woman would be willing to share .
tr	4	With a smile , she gladly accepted , placing a small hand on the sleeve of his jacket .
tr	4	" The moment that we are close enough to send a signal , we will send a distress call .
tr	4	Setting the captain and his men free for a get out of jail free card ... he smirked .
tr	4	He was hoping they would have a good run-in with the rum barrel the previous evening .
tr	3	They chose a few trusted men to go with them and brought them up to speed with the plan .
tr	1	The Spaniard 's short , bulky frame concealed his strength and speed , both with weapons and his fists .
tr	2	However , in reality , she was nervous and did not want to show it to Roberto .
tr	0	One tried to touch her but she slapped him playfully and chuckled when he took his hand away sheepishly .
tr	4	The impressive figure of the older man was intimidating to the impostors and allowed no rebuff .
tr	2	I must admit , I was more afraid on board your ship than on the Contra O Vento . "
tr	4	Her heart raced but she nodded her head in acceptance and placed it in her skirt pocket .
tr	3	Pierre touched his arm , which drew his attention away to a tall soldier walking directly to them .
tr	4	The whole idea of putting her in danger among the other pirates made his palms sweaty .
tr	3	They chose a few trusted men to go with them and brought them up to speed with the plan .
tr	1	The Spaniard 's short , bulky frame concealed his strength and speed , both with weapons and his fists .
tr	2	However , in reality , she was nervous and did not want to show it to Roberto .
tr	0	One tried to touch her but she slapped him playfully and chuckled when he took his hand away sheepishly .
tr	2	I must admit , I was more afraid on board your ship than on the Contra O Vento . "
tr	3	Thoughts that Roberto was serious when he had fastened her to the railing threw her heart into turmoil .
tr	4	Though maybe they did it out of fear most times , she sensed a genuine respect toward him .
tr	3	The giant wanted to go out and hunt , but the captain refused to give them any ammunition .
tr	0	Two days later , another storm hit us and once again , we had to abandon the ship .
tr	4	Regaining our strength with a great deal of rest and well-balanced meals made the world of difference .
tr	0	Another month passed by before a ship passed that was willing to take us back to Portugal . "
tr	3	I didn 't fear the savages so much as the cruelty of the captain to my father .
tr	1	On their wedding night he forced himself on her and nine months later I was born .
tr	0	The ropes around her had cut into her flesh and he had to cut them away .
tr	1	Everything happened so fast , the roaring sounds of the storm vanishing as his heart pounded in his chest .
tr	4	The good doctor spoke sternly and he let her down , covering the body with a blanket .
tr	0	" Tired , stiff and aching all over my body , but happy to be alive .
tr	3	She looked at him in wonder , this man that she was trying very hard to understand .
tr	0	He wanted to convince her as he took her hand and brought it to his lips .
tr	1	She was stunned at his confession and had no reply as she saw the tenderness in his eyes .
tr	1	" I find your company pleasant and not once did I feel afraid while with you .
tr	4	The blush that appeared on her face was the most appealing thing he had ever seen .
tr	4	She smiled at him and he returned the smile just before one man captured his attention .
tr	0	He knew from the moment he saw her in the harbour of Lisbon he had lost his heart .
tr	4	Once he was on the upper deck the men had been congratulating him the whole day .
tr	4	His courting was obvious as he spent time with her , making sure her needs were met .
tr	3	One thing she knew was that she was not indifferent to him as he had put it .
tr	4	Sometimes he would tell her something funny that had happened during the day that made her laugh loudly .
tr	0	Startled , the dark figure looked at him , pushed her hard against the railing and ran away .
tr	3	With lightning speed and with one blow to the jaw he sent him against Pierre with a thud .
tr	4	It was the second time that she had heard the term of endearment and her heart sped up .
tr	4	He caressed her until he could feel that she relaxed against him and then let her go .
tr	4	He looked at her , making sure she was all right , and placed his glass on the desk .
tr	4	It was late when he returned her to her cabin , light-headed with the love he felt for her .
tr	2	Worry and concern stood out in the lines of his mouth and eyes and she want to remove that .
tr	4	Another question dawned on her and she started to chuckle , her eyes filled with merriment as she asked .
tr	2	" Not to sound like a parrot but you do know how to change my mind . "
tr	2	Roberto was smiling non-stop , holding her close to him , never once letting her go .
tr	4	He took his time in teaching her about her own desires and what inflamed him the most .
tr	0	Kicking , she was picked up as if she was a feather and carried downstairs to her old cabin .
tr	0	They would not hear her through the wailing winds , the creaking ship and crushing waters .
tr	0	He held on tightly and enjoyed her soft body against him , his hands brushing the soft skin .
tr	1	" I am so sorry for not being there , " he finally said in a whisper .
tr	4	Just thinking of what could have happened replayed another time , a time he would much rather forget .
tr	0	At first , he had to remove many tangles but eventually her hair was straight and shining .
tr	0	She made the choice to marry him and what she got was a loving and caring husband .
tr	2	He wanted her to know him , to love him and was not ashamed to answer uncomfortable questions .
tr	3	I want you to know that and I will never get tired of saying it . "
tr	4	He pulled her closer and demanded her to open her mouth once again , passion flowing as they kissed .
tr	4	Pierre would tell her about their journeys in great detail depicting Roberto as a good leader although a pirate .
tr	0	And of course she thought about Roberto , her husband , and what life held for them .
tr	4	The waves stood ten feet high , towering over them before they crashed down on top of them .
tr	4	His love warmed her up and she gave to him what he wanted , her love .
tr	0	" I love you , " she managed to say again ; butterflies scattering around her stomach and throat .
tr	1	She felt dizzy and said , " I love you , " which brought him to a fruitful climax .
tr	4	He smiled , stroking her lower back to relax her , lifting her hips , exposing her .
tr	4	Feeling her own heartbeat racing , she felt satiated , her body trembling under his embrace .
tr	0	I want to farm and make it a success , for our children one day . "
tr	0	† † † After weeks of marital bliss the crow master called out , " Land ahoy ! "
tr	3	But he desperately wanted her to trust him , and that she was willing to do .
tr	4	When he left he was sombre and just stood at the rail as he watched the land mass .
tr	1	It was a beautiful island filled with lush , thick foliage , a mountain on the far horizon .
tr	2	The ship 's doctor took her hand and motioned for her to go to her cabin .
tr	4	She could barely contain herself until waves of worry would capture her and create havoc in her mind .
tr	4	At the shore he was met by several men ; some new ones and some familiar faces .
tr	3	Roberto knew him well , and the mere thought that the woman was at his mercy was devastating .
tr	4	She received a slap from the Falcon and the pitcher fell from her hand and broke on the floor .
tr	0	" You were always too soft , " The Falcon said as he watched the display .
tr	4	" The woman needs to be put in her place , but you always were the gentleman . "
tr	1	She felt safe in his strong arms and she smiled , wrapping her arms around herself .
tr	4	The rows of books on the shelves were worn at the corners from years of reading .
tr	4	He knew the seas , the currents , and every kind of cloud and what it meant .
tr	4	From her father they were stories that other people lived , yet now it was different .
tr	0	They had taught him the things he was teaching her now and it did not sit well with her .
tr	3	The men made sure that she stayed hidden in the cabin so as not to attract any unnecessary attention .
tr	0	With rough hands he took her chin in his hand turning her head to both sides .
tr	1	First , I am going to play with you , " he said , grabbing her breasts .
tr	1	" Thank you , Falcon , " Roberto replied , bowing respectfully , grabbing her arm .
tr	0	With both his hands , he cupped her face and kissed her , his breath warm against her skin .
tr	4	" Yes you are , my love , " she laughed , her cheeks still hurting .
tr	4	It was the greatest gift he had ever received , unconditional love for a rough pirate feared by many .
tr	2	It took me awhile to see through your plan but now I am back to claim her .
tr	0	Soon you could hear the clash of steel upon steel resounding at a high pitch through the night .
tr	2	" You son of a bitch , " the Falcon screamed , throwing himself at Roberto .
tr	2	Cutting into the air , weariness on his face , he launched forward onto Roberto 's sword .
tr	0	The other man let go his hold and he tied her hands in front of her .
tr	1	She was small and blond , not as young as she thought , but with beautiful blue eyes .
tr	2	I don 't know when or how , but you will pay for that as well . "
tr	2	" You have cost me a lot and I will collect from you and this bitch . "
tr	4	For the first time since the ordeal began she turned , pressed herself into him , and cried .
tr	4	Pedro came over to them , climbing over the lifeless body , and reached for his sister .
tr	0	" My name is Pierre du Val , Captain in the Dutch East India Company . "
tr	0	He held out an arm and she looped her arm through his , smiling up to him .
tr	0	" I am so glad that Captain de Ville has found happiness with you , my dear .
tr	1	His mouth tasted her sweetness , as she pressed against him , soft and fitting into his frame .
tr	2	" There is something you need to know Roberto , about your parents , " Captain le Roux said .
tr	1	A tear ran down his face , which he wiped away , reliving the good times in his mind .
tr	0	She would stay on the farm with his mother and sister during the long months he would be away .
tr	4	She could entertain him , playing the piano masterfully , and made him feel like the luckiest man alive .
tr	0	" I am scared of losing you , " he finally admitted , and she gasped " Why ?
tr	3	She had thought about her parents " reaction during this time and what they would think of the union .
tr	0	" You are an amazing man and my father will see that and love you , " She continued .
tr	1	She sat up straight , lifting her leg over him and straddled him , cupping his face .
tr	3	Not that Roberto complained about less to get rid of when he wanted to cuddle into her .
tr	4	Again , dread filled Roberto 's mind , wondering for the umpteenth time how he would be received .
tr	4	He took her away from their father , kissed her soundly on the mouth , and she giggled .
tr	0	" I never thought I could have this , a wife and baby to call my own .
tr	0	" No , son , just a man who has walked the path and understands much more . "
tr	1	" I want to get my wife in bed , if you don 't mind . "
tr	3	" I always listen to sense , " stated the man at the table , grinning .
tr	1	Finan shifted uneasily , and sat down in the chair across from his master , his face suddenly earnest .
tr	1	" It is that which worries me ; you do not consider the possibility of defeat . "
tr	3	" No harm will come to me or her ; that is the point of this subterfuge .
tr	2	" It is as well that you will help me , for without you my plans would fail . "
tr	4	Finan saw many things then which he could not have guessed at from Rafe 's merriment before .
tr	4	He saw worry and apprehension , but could still only surmise at what these were directed .
tr	3	It was with some surprise that he realised that Lord Rafe was in the grip of hesitation .
tr	1	However , Finan was not given to conjecture , having a simple faith in plain facts .
tr	4	Still , he wished he knew what Rafe was thinking , what was causing him to experience such uncertainty .
tr	3	In short , although reasonably entertaining , they gave little of the writer 's personality away .
tr	4	" Why I shall be no one ; a nobody that she will feel no need to impress . "
tr	4	Rafe extended his arm and , still in his relaxed position , pushed his goblet onto the table .
tr	1	Finan was rather surprised that his master intended to continue on a course disapproved of by Lord Brogan .
tr	2	You know such a consideration would not weigh with me if I thought you in danger .
tr	1	The truth is I have no opinion to give , " answered Finan with a shrug .
tr	0	Lord Brogan came around the table and placed his hand on his son 's broad shoulder .
tr	0	As he approached , Rafe noticed that his tunic was liberally splashed with his mornings repast .
tr	0	He had always supposed that his betrothal would become more palatable to him as time passed .
tr	3	It seemed to him that he stood there an eternity , and in truth his wait was rather lengthy .
tr	3	Though not particularly big , its placement on top of the hill made it hard to attack .
tr	3	It was a difficult situation and , whatever people said , this betrothal was not in the least romantic .
tr	4	While not ecstatic the gentle feelings of respect and regard were enough upon which to build a successful marriage .
tr	4	They had been treasured and bore every sign of the eagerness with which she had devoured them .
tr	3	Truth be told he was in the grip of such conflicting emotions he felt a little confused .
tr	4	About him there was an aura of impatient tension and , she decided , he was probably decisive .
tr	0	Rafe was taken aback by the image , and felt very stupid for conceiving such a foolish notion .
tr	0	Her hair long and curling , and was caught back from her face to hang down her back .
tr	2	Chief among these was the conviction that it was going to be a long journey home .
tr	4	For now I 'm only pleased to share his warmth , and Eda has ridden before . "
tr	4	" He 's a war horse , " answered Rafe , " one of several belonging to Lord Rafe .
tr	4	Finally she had seemed a little more lucid , even sensible , which had surprised him .
tr	1	She had called him Finan , Finn , bestowing upon him trust and a tentative friendship .
tr	0	Chapter Five Rafe reined in as dusk approached at a place he thought suitable for camp .
tr	4	With a sigh of relief he realised that neither lady was going to indulge in tears .
tr	4	Rafe watched in horror as Eda 's eyes filled with tears and he turned panicked to Adele .
tr	1	" Mistress Kathryn ; she always adds those spices to pork , ' tis my favourite . "
tr	3	Pulling out his knife he chose two that branched in to a V and cut these to appropriate lengths .
tr	1	It was as if he could not find the words to express the sights , sounds , and feelings .
tr	3	" You only feel it the once with that first battle , after that you are cured . "
tr	3	It seemed to him that the best option , as was so often the case , was to wait .
tr	3	Finally he found himself wishing that they would attack just so the intolerable wait was over .
tr	4	His voice was so soft he doubted it would wake her , but he dared not whisper any louder .
tr	4	The snorting of horses as they made a charge struck him with a feeling of ice cold dread .
tr	4	-------- Adele struggled along , the weight of the heavy fur lined cloaks hampering her progress greatly .
tr	1	Eda 's muffled sobbing broke in on her inner musings , and she sank to the ground .
tr	1	Passing an arm around her friend 's shoulders she drew Eda 's trembling form into her arms .
tr	3	" No doubt you will tell me it was one of the other ladies at the fort . "
tr	0	He knew that her gaze was upon him , as gentle and unconcerned as it always was .
tr	4	" We cannot rest here long , t ' would be best if you had a drink . "
tr	1	A sound suspiciously like a giggle broke from Adele 's lips as Eda glared at him in indignation .
tr	4	Eda shook her head , however , and regarding her friend indignantly , not amused by the recollection .
tr	4	" I was eleven and there was a black bird 's nest in the aforementioned tree . "
tr	2	" The young scoundrel ; I dare say he thought it a grand jest to fool you so ! "
tr	4	He had not , reflected Finan , changed so very much from those long ago days .
tr	3	" A small matter that King Ine wishes to have dealt with , my lord . "
tr	1	If Rafe had been present Finan was certain that he would have no scruple in confiding in him .
tr	3	That was the belief that in a woman , unusual was not an epithet to aspire to .
tr	4	These ladies believed that his lack of words had betrayed a great depth of emotion and sympathy .
tr	1	She was conscious of a sinking feeling of disappointment , tangled up with hurt and embarrassment .
tr	4	" I feel as though I had been carrying Charger instead of the other way round . "
tr	4	" I never even thought ... " Her fingers worked frantically for a few moments and then she shrugged .
tr	2	Rafe eased from his saddle and turned to Eda and Adele , his hand held out .
tr	3	It was entirely possible that she would catch a chill in these conditions , then what would he do ?
tr	3	It was very unlikely that she would not somehow find out about that when they arrived ... Great goodness !
tr	2	He could not be Lord Rafe , and it was impossible for him to be Finan .
tr	3	There was little shelter to be had so no doubt they would pass an uncomfortable night .
tr	3	" Now , my lord , what is it that you wished to discuss with me ? "
tr	4	" Very well , but I demand the same in return , " answered Finan with unruffled calm .
tr	1	asked Finan , calmly bending to the child 's height and taking a strong grip on his shoulders .
tr	0	He dismounted , making his way to Charger and the two weary figures that swayed unsteadily on his back .
tr	3	" Did it not occur to you that he is just as tired as we are ?
tr	0	Rafe dried his hands as best he could , and set about coaxing a flame to the dry twigs .
tr	3	" It must have been hard to come to terms with your betrothal to Lord Rafe . "
tr	4	There was silence after her statement , Rafe felt his tongue thick and unwieldy in his mouth .
tr	4	For a moment she groped around in her thoughts for a way to turn his attention elsewhere .
tr	1	" I am sorry ; I did not mean to bring to mind something that pains you . "
tr	2	" Poor Finn ; you did not like her very much at all , did you ? "
tr	4	" I know that it must be , but surely a problem shared is a problem halved ? "
tr	3	I thought that you wished to talk of the worry that has plagued you since our camp was attacked .
tr	4	They do not ride hard and have rarely been less than a few hours behind us .
tr	2	" Do you truly have no idea , or are you concealing your fear inspiring suspicions from us ? "
tr	0	How could she show such faith in him when he had let them down so terribly ?
tr	0	Rafe swallowed uncomfortably as Eda 's head snapped round to pin him with an outraged and indignant glare .
tr	4	At least , that was not precisely true , for Adele 's expression was of innocent bewilderment .
tr	3	" That was very unkind of me but ... but I just could not help myself . "
tr	4	She spread out her palms in an appealing gesture that begged him to see the funny side .
tr	2	" You looked so very discomfited , so wholly unlike the knave you supposed we would think you .
tr	4	He was alone , a circumstance that would have bewildered Rafe yet further had he but known of it .
tr	1	It blew on Rand at an angle , striking his left side and rippling up through his hair .
tr	1	His only reward was for Rand 's sword to press closer into the flesh of his neck .
tr	1	He felt a light sensation on his neck and turned quickly , his sword swinging viciously through the air .
tr	4	Rand and Bron parted before it and the knife struck the trunk of the tree behind them .
tr	4	The blade buried a good inch into the wood , its jewel encrusted handle protruding outwards between them both .
tr	3	The intruder was making no effort to be stealthy and had just tripped over a small stool .
tr	3	" Outside the door , " answered Finan , sitting up and stretching his tall frame .
tr	1	" ' Tis a cold night ; ' twill be a hard winter I think . "
tr	4	Lord Brogan did not betray either surprise or dismay at this utterance , but continued in his measured pace .
tr	0	The air was stale and carried the taste of smoke , along with the savoury fragrance of meat .
tr	0	It was almost guilty , as though he were witnessing something which he had no right to see .
tr	0	He shook her shoulder gently , and felt her move away from his touch with a sigh .
tr	0	All he knew was that as he looked at her it was as if time had stood still .
tr	1	This new piece of information did not fit the image she had built up of Lord Rafe .
tr	3	Why then did he have to phrase it like that , so baldly and without explanation .
tr	3	" If you knew what I was thinking you would know that you need not tell me that .
tr	4	For a moment both stared at the other ; Adele in trembling fury , and Rafe in complete surprise .
tr	2	He has ignored you for most of your life , yet you speak of his kindness ? "
tr	4	The look she gave him left him in no doubt as to whom she was referring .
tr	4	He managed to gather his wits together just in time to save himself from a complete fall from grace .
tr	4	Awkward did not seem to be a big enough word to describe the atmosphere that would reign .
tr	0	" It is a fact that I am well aware of , Lady Eda , " replied Rafe grimly .
tr	2	Try to do that which I could not and turn from the road before you . "
tr	0	A hunt would career madly across the countryside , and such a course could not be calculated and avoided .
tr	4	Then he heard the sound he had been dreading ; the galloping of horses and the barking of dogs .
tr	4	There were seven men , led by a youth probably still short of his fourteenth year .
tr	0	It was occupied by a large framed man , tending slightly towards paunch but strong looking for all that .
tr	4	" What happened between your brother and I was ill chance , I meant him no harm . "
tr	0	He stood , swaying slightly , and reached out a hand to brace himself against the second chair .
tr	1	" My honour is at stake and you think I could care anything for your penitence ? "
tr	3	" Added to all of this is the fact that I am indebted to you ! "
tr	3	The youth pulled out his knife , twisting the blade so the jewels in the hilt caught the light .
tr	3	" If that is how this will be settled , then return my sword and let me go . "
tr	1	I wish you no ill , but I must be seen to do something : my family expects it .
tr	3	" I have business to attend to ; allow me to leave that I might see to it . "
tr	4	It had never left Rafe 's father 's side during all his years of service to King Ine .
tr	4	" I did not ... " " Enough , Bron , the subject becomes tiresome . "
tr	1	Bron raised his hand in a gesture of farewell , and moved to follow the warrior 's tracks .
tr	2	They lead him away from those his master followed and into a more wooded part of the forest .
tr	2	The going was harder , suited to a man on foot but less suited to a rider on horseback .
tr	3	" Finn told us that we were not to stop , not until we had reached safety .
tr	2	Finn would have his glory , she only hoped that he would live to enjoy it .
tr	2	They had been stationed as lookouts , a small group of soldiers huddled around a fire .
tr	3	Finan had lunged at his brother 's attacker , and together they had rolled from sight .
tr	3	The reaction to this statement was not as dramatic as Eda had thought it would be .
tr	4	A page with brown hair and a liberal dusting of freckles appeared from inside the tent .
tr	3	He paused on the threshold at the sight of two ladies in his master 's tent .
tr	0	" Eda , I already know that Lord Rafe is kind and that I shall like him .
tr	0	Why has Lord Rafe had to leave to fetch him ; what has befallen him ? "
tr	4	Adele watched the little boy tremble , and felt tears welling up in her own eyes .
tr	0	So why was he finding it so hard to believe that Rafe was probably already dead ?
tr	0	Rafe heaved a large sigh and cautiously made his way toward the huge animal that Finan was astride .
tr	4	" Not before I have accomplished that which I came for , " replied Rand firmly .
tr	3	They sat , silent and still , their attention halved between the fight and each other .
tr	0	He lifted his hand to push a strand of Adele 's hair back from her face .
tr	4	He looked suddenly , with mud smeared across his cheek and in his hair , boyish and unthreatening .
tr	4	Rafe waited until she and Eda had disappeared into the mist before addressing Rand once more .
tr	4	Rafe was silent for a few moments before finally lifting his hand to his eyes and rubbing them wearily .
tr	1	Still , he had the same information concerning Rand , but was it really worth anything ?
tr	1	Now , without the desperation and anxiety pumping through his veins , he was incredibly tired .
tr	4	" They deserve that their lives should mean something , they should be the means to end this . "
tr	2	You fought against us , Rand , your friends whom you had lived with in brotherhood !
tr	2	" I should have told you that I would have no part in this foolish scheme of yours . "
tr	4	Rafe shook his head , his eyes travelling for an infinitesimal second to where Rand stood .
tr	1	" I think we have discussed the most pressing of the circumstances that face us . "
tr	2	For one thing it would not work , and I would only succeed in looking foolish .
tr	3	" Then I suppose there is nought for it but to retire to my own camp . "
tr	0	Finan had moved into the seat Rand had vacated , and his face was studiously devoid of expression .
tr	0	Rafe gave a shout of laughter , and Finan lifted his eyes heavenward , shaking his head .
tr	3	To them I am still Finan and that is how you will address me to them . "
tr	0	" Then Lady Eda said that she was asking whether Lady Adele had liked you . "
tr	2	" I thought you said she did not know it was you who wrote to her ? "
tr	4	The reminder of your incompetence puts me in no good humour with you , " responded King Ine sharply .
tr	0	Lord Brogan knew it was best for Rafe to have at least a hand in the matter .
tr	0	What man with such an advantage could possibly fail at anything he turned his hand to ?
tr	4	" I wish Lord Brogan were here , perhaps he could make Rafe see sense . "
tr	3	' Tis only when the argument does not touch him that he is capable of diplomacy . "
tr	0	Instead of saying so however he asked what had put such a notion into Finan 's head .
tr	4	" I have seen him negotiate the most difficult and delicate surrender after two days without sleep .
tr	3	You cannot say that did not touch him personally , for his men 's lives were at stake . "
tr	3	Finan reined in his trembling mount , but did not attempt to slide from the horse 's back .
tr	0	Hardly had he finished speaking than , with a jerk of his wrist , Finan threw his dagger .
tr	2	The journey seemed long , he could feel blood flowing from his wound and soaking his tunic .
tr	1	Rand stood , a curiously grim expression entering his face as he pulled his sword from its scabbard .
tr	4	Even Finan had been surprised to find the camp he had entered was not his own .
tr	2	" You know , even as a child you lived up to that red hair of yours .
tr	3	" He knew his father to be right , but for a long time he was uncomfortable with it .
tr	3	Rafe had to admit the truth of this statement , but it did little to quell his temper .
tr	4	We none of us will ever be able to forget , it would be wrong to try .
tr	4	His voice was steady , but there was a white line of anger around his mouth .
tr	3	Rafe took hold of the fur that covered the bed and attempted to pull it back .
tr	4	His foster brother 's face was flushed , a thin film of perspiration covering it with an unhealthy sheen .
tr	2	Drogo looked towards his master , but Rand shook his head and Drogo was obliged to hold his tongue .
tr	4	" It would probably be best if we join our camps together , we are vulnerable apart . "
tr	2	Adele was very still , looking up at him and yet not really seeing him at all .
tr	3	" The fact that he has not is proof that something is very wrong , " returned Adele .
tr	4	He saw confusion in her eyes , a turmoil of thoughts that caused a slight furrow between her brows .
tr	0	Yet in a second all that was gone , for her as well as for him .
tr	4	Adele sank into a deep curtsy , feeling very foolish that she could think of nought else to say .
tr	1	Every line of his posture told of his frustration , his exasperation at the situation he found himself in .
tr	4	Now she felt very young and inadequate , filled with an awkwardness that held her mute before him .
tr	0	Confronted with any situation he had always known what should be done , and had accomplished it .
tr	2	" And the Lord Rafe who spoke to me just a moment ago was nothing like Finn . "
tr	0	" I dare say he felt just as awkward as you did , " soothed Eda .
tr	1	Eda put her arm around her friend 's shoulders and drew her into a comforting embrace .
tr	4	Adele was too upset to be reasonable and her time was far better spent trying to sooth her .
tr	4	The question came as such a surprise that for a moment Eda was quite devoid of breath .
tr	0	Yet she had always admired him from afar , it had been Adele he was drawn to .
tr	4	He had begun to take more notice of Eda , and his manner had become steadily warmer .
tr	0	Rafe nodded , dusk was approaching and it was necessary to accomplish their plans before it was completely dark .
tr	3	" I fear that we will not know why until Finan recovers sufficiently to tell us . "
tr	3	" No matter ; it has been my observation that great anger needs much fuel to sustain its intensity .
tr	2	" The one which , I have no doubt , you have prepared a monologue for . "
tr	2	" Do not be so anxious ; your discomfort will only make her ill at ease .
tr	3	Try instead to put all that is past behind you , there is no help in looking back . "
tr	2	" No , but ... I did not wish your hopes to be raised only to be disappointed . "
tr	4	Lady Eda , though upon occasion irritating of manner , is I believe a perfectly agreeable young lady . "
tr	1	Something in Rafe 's eyes told him that his friend was considering visiting physical harm upon his person .
tr	3	He was starting to think that anything would have been better than the way that conversation had gone .
tr	0	Eda pulled a large bag from its hiding place , carefully running a hand over its surface .
tr	3	" I think that it would be best if we tried to bring the fever down . "
tr	4	" How he burns , Eda , I wish there was some way to submerge him . "
tr	2	" This way will do well enough , ' twill be harder for us is all . "
tr	4	She pushed the damp hair back from her face , thinking that never had she been so hot before .
tr	4	For a while she rested , but something was nagging at the back of her mind .
tr	0	For a moment Adele was distracted by the thought that Finan was such an old friend of Rafe 's .
tr	4	Few things in his life had been good , let alone imparted that feeling onto him .
tr	4	It hadn 't hurt that she had been one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen .
tr	3	She sighed irritably and turned again to the trio on the other side of the tent .
tr	0	" When we first met , you said Finn was a friendly name , " Rafe swallowed awkwardly .
tr	1	She was his bride and she was lovely ; not just in form , but also in spirit .
tr	4	He had hardly spoken since entering the room , but had availed himself of copious amounts of liquid refreshment .
tr	3	" Yes , but ... I am afraid there is a little more to it than that . "
tr	3	" ' Tis my master that will kill me , there is no place that he cannot reach ! "
tr	0	" That I have failed , that I have come to you and told you all ! "
tr	0	" I dreamed that I was a child again and my mother was bathing my face . "
tr	1	Rafe laid a hand on Finan 's shoulder , pushing him back down on the bed .
tr	3	No ; he stated quite definitely that it was his master that sought Rafe 's demise . "
tr	3	" I understand him and know that this is not something that he would do . "
tr	4	Finan came close to telling her precisely what she could do with her eggs and milk .
tr	2	" No indeed , Finan ; ' tis I who you wish would cease to trouble you ! "
tr	3	Finan could not deny the truth of her statement , but that only made things worse .
tr	1	" I promise I will not drive you to insanity , Finan , " assured Adele .
tr	3	" I think I can promise that I shall not try to do so today , my lady . "
tr	3	Finan settled himself further down on the bed that he might comfortably drift back to sleep .
tr	3	She came to an abrupt halt in the midst of the tents , but did not turn .
tr	4	He stood barely a step away , not reaching out to her or trying to make her face him .
tr	4	If his mother were here she would embrace Adele and tell her that all would be fine .
tr	0	His heart had begun to hammer faster , and where their hands touched a fiery warmth had sprung up .
tr	4	He was acutely conscious of the tingling sensation Adele 's hand had left where their skin had met .
tr	4	They were sitting by the fire in the great hall , surrounded by preparations for the mid day meal .
tr	0	It was a cruel trick to play upon him , he who took such pleasure in warfare .
tr	2	Brogan , who would not have cared if his son had shown no aptitude for fighting .
tr	0	I know , of course , that you are no mean swordsman , but Stefan is an artist . "
tr	4	For the second time Rafe saw a similarity between the brothers which was normally conspicuous by its absence .
tr	4	There was a thoughtful look in his eyes , a cloudiness that he seemed to be trying to resolve .
tr	4	Before he could say a word Rafe interrupted him with an impatient toss of his head .
tr	2	Rafe shook his head , trying to force his brain to accept so outlandish a suggestion .
tr	2	" Come ; surely you did not think I came out of love for my fellow man ?
tr	4	If Wessex becomes unstable then my lands are endangered , I will not allow that to happen . "
tr	4	" Then there seems little else to decide upon , " stated Rafe , breaking the silence .
tr	0	Without realising he had moved , he found himself at her side and took her hand in his .
tr	0	My father ... " Adele shook her head , and he clasped her hands tightly within his own .
tr	1	Rand shook his head , words sticking in his throat even as he fought to express himself .
tr	4	A smile trembled on her lips even as tears rushed forth to spill down her face .
tr	0	Rafe watched as they embraced again , a sharp feeling of pain and dismay tugging at his chest .
tr	4	If she found such plain speaking embarrassing , it was just a feeling she would have to endure .
tr	4	He remembered the way he had looked her over and dismissed her scornfully as a foolish child .
tr	1	When his mind was as preoccupied , as it was now , it was his custom to pace .
tr	1	" I mean that if it is your wish , I will release you from our betrothal . "
tr	3	" But I do not precisely see what that has to do with our betrothal . "
tr	3	" It has nought to do with the battle , or anything save yourself , " replied Rafe .
tr	1	To his great astonishment , she leaned forwards and slipped one of her small , soft hands into his .
tr	4	They were engaged in a somewhat prolonged kiss that both seemed to be enjoying with equal ardour .
tr	1	" I have no intention of placing any trust in him at all , Finan . "
tr	4	His enemy , instead of being dead as he had been promised , was very much alive .
tr	2	Your family has worked itself into a position of unparalleled trust for the last four generations .
tr	3	When will you realise that they are just words that we use to hide the truth .
tr	0	The swords touched with a scrape and clang of metal ; the jolt travelled up Rafe 's arm painfully .
tr	4	Rafe wielded his sword and just managed to prevent the blow from falling on his shoulder .
tr	4	The fighting wore on , desperate and vicious , until one shout was heard above the general tumult .
tr	0	" You had better know , swine , or a great many vastly unpleasant things will befall you ! "
tr	0	He had no wish for an audience when he said that which he was going to have to articulate .
tr	2	How could he be so cruel as to mortify her by talking of her love for him ?
tr	0	Worse , she had questioned his honour and Rand held nothing as dear as his honour .
tr	4	He knew its value , and he knew how it felt to bear a stain upon it .
tr	0	Over Rand 's shoulder she saw the camp and , thinking only of escape , made to walk away .
tr	0	" I would have arranged for a private moment alone in the orchard at the fort ! "
tr	3	I thought that if I told you the truth you would think that I was like my father . "
tr	1	Eda stepped forward , burying her flushed face in Rand 's shoulder and wrapping her arms around him .
tr	4	" You are mine now , Eda , and I swear you shall never regret it . "
tr	0	" Now you are just being bad tempered , and that 's no way to please a man .
tr	3	Chapter Thirty One Lord Brogan dismounted and looked around him ; the camp was bustling with activity .
tr	4	The soldier bowed , eager to have them off his hands , and beckoned that they should follow him .
tr	4	Finan has been wounded and I asked that he might be given time to rest without disturbance .
tr	4	Lord Brogan was very still and restive , so completely opposite to his son 's impatient temperament .
tr	4	However he , Lady Adele , and Lady Eda were attacked a day 's journey from the fort .
tr	4	Adele 's eyes had taken on a faraway look and her lips were touched with a reminiscent smile .
tr	3	" I think that it was difficult for us both at first , " she ventured at last .
tr	4	His words startled Adele , they were so far removed from that which had gone before .
tr	3	" I was sitting in my tent , trying to forget the bloody mess that existed outside .
tr	4	Adele fingered the thick plait that lay over her shoulder , a regretful look on her face .
tr	2	" You are very fond of my son , are you not , my dear ? "
tr	1	On his side all I can promise you is that he will make you an interesting husband .
tr	4	He is kind and generous , and will do everything in his power to keep you safe and happy .
tr	0	Rafe rubbed a hand against the rasping growth of the day old beard upon his chin .
tr	0	" He seems to think his valour was not adequately repaid and I was favoured above him . "
tr	3	" I think , my lords , that it is time that Eda and I retired . "
tr	4	Rafe turned from his contemplation of the floor , his wretchedness of spirit visible upon his face .
tr	4	" No , Rafe ; it was not the whole reason , " he answered wearily .
tr	1	And yet so many promises , so many stories , so many secrets are yet untold .
tr	4	If the time comes , will he be able to forgive the woman that betrayed him ?
tr	1	Using my famous Spy Games knots , I tied the napkins around his wrists , tightly .
tr	0	I grabbed a strawberry tart , because prosecuting a spy makes one hungry , and continued my attack .
tr	4	" There 's more to the story , " he murmured , his gaze lingering on my lips .
tr	4	" You are hereby sentenced to fifteen minutes of intense embarrassment by sitting in your underwear in public . "
tr	3	I tugged at the binds , but they weren 't called my specialty knots for nothing .
tr	3	" This might hurt but I need to pull you to safety while I go for help . "
tr	1	This time I did run my fingers across his cheek , then I smoothed his hair .
tr	2	I was rooted to his side , too scared to go , too scared to stay .
tr	0	Just a kind man with probably a simple life , maybe some grandchildren an hour away .
tr	0	But no matter how hard I 'd scrubbed , I couldn 't wash away the memory of what happened .
tr	2	Thoughts of him hovered in the room , not letting go , not leaving me alone .
tr	4	Dad was buried in the morning newspaper , his legs sprawled out to the side of the table .
tr	0	" If he so much as touched a hair on your head -- " " Whoa !
tr	0	Dad hadn 't shown he cared this much since I lost my luggage on our flight to France .
tr	4	He 'd been trying to get me excited about his new line of work since we 'd arrived .
tr	1	He gazed off , memories of past times flashing across his face , times when she was around .
tr	4	I nodded while under the table I dug my fingernails into the palms of my hands .
tr	0	Maybe he 'd gotten home last night , wrapped up his arm , and would be at work today .
tr	2	Resting my head against the front door , I traced my fingers along the grains of wood .
tr	0	Dad wanted to talk to me , really talk to me , and I 'd said no ?
tr	1	I kicked it off to the side and it landed behind a bush with a satisfying thud .
tr	1	Within minutes I 'd know whether or not my date took a big drink in the Seine .
tr	2	When Aimee wasn 't looking , I ditched my armor , but it wouldn 't be for long .
tr	4	And then this macho man breezed through the entrance , full of swagger , wearing leather pants and sunglasses .
tr	4	As soon as Dad strode through the side door , his boots echoing on the cement , everyone quieted .
tr	2	Gray held the line , and I silently pled with him to pull me back up .
tr	2	I refused to look at Malcolm , and I didn 't have to look at my dad .
tr	0	In a flash , my easel was set up , canvas ready to go , and paints in hand .
tr	3	And the only thought crossing my mind was that someone shot at me the night before .
tr	4	" That 's bloody nice work , " a male voice with a hot English accent said behind me .
tr	2	After the stunt you pulled this morning , I 'm not the one who should be apologizing . "
tr	3	The next team that came through did better , until they shoved the money roll into my satchel .
tr	1	You didn 't show up to work and then sauntered into Spy Games like a king .
tr	0	I gathered my stuff , collapsed the easel , and flashed a scathing look at Malcolm .
tr	1	I sprinted across the grass , dodging tourists , and passed the first leg of the tower .
tr	3	After the ride up , the doors slid open at the tippy top , and I burst out .
tr	4	But what always amazed me was the wide expanse of blue , like I was overlooking the entire world .
tr	4	I followed the few happy memories I had and the crazy wish she were here , looking for me .
tr	4	" I found the scones -- " I cut her off in the middle of her sentence .
tr	3	Then she started mumbling and I wasn 't sure if she was talking to me or not .
tr	2	The one always rushing off on trips for her scrapbooking business or locked away in her bedroom , working .
tr	1	" Oui , " Aimee whispered , inching toward the door while holding my arm in a death grip .
tr	2	" This woman from my group managed to say the right words and you completely ignored her . "
tr	4	" As staff , you are supposed to do everything possible to fulfill our spy experience .
tr	2	Why don 't you go home and soak in the tub and eat your grandmother 's cookies .
tr	0	" Good luck and stay safe , " I said , and after a quick hug , she left .
tr	0	The past few times , I 'd arrived early and Frankie and I 'd played card games .
tr	4	I entered the bookstore and navigated the narrow aisles with books towering on either side of me .
tr	1	I 'd have loved it if my hostage could slip out of his binds and save me right now .
tr	3	I fumbled at the knots , but Peyton took two steps , grabbed my arm and yanked me away .
tr	2	The rough wood jabbed into my back but I refused to show any pain to this bully .
tr	4	Tips of green stuck out so I dug under the layers of tissue paper protecting the camera .
tr	2	But in a situation like this , I had to follow the old rule : Follow the money .
tr	2	And in order to follow the money , I 'd need to sign up for the pastry thing .
tr	1	" Yes , I 'll be packing for boarding school because my dad is kicking me out .
tr	3	The whole Spy Games staff was crammed into our kitchenette , sitting around the table drinking instant coffee .
tr	3	Nancy looked at me with sympathetic eyes that said , " Oh , you poor thing . "
tr	0	In no time at all , we 'll have a new mission mapped out and ready to go . "
tr	3	That was why Nancy looked at me like I 'd have to live with the guilt .
tr	2	No cracks to slip into and disappear for a while , like a month or two .
tr	4	He paused , and in that moment I could see the heartbreak written on his face .
tr	0	As if Dad sensed my doubt , he said , " Hasn 't she always wanted to travel ? "
tr	3	" Don 't you think it 's odd that she didn 't give it to you in person ?
tr	2	I ran over to the front door and dug out my phone from my jacket pocket .
tr	3	I 'd follow through with the Extravaganza and do a little investigating at the same time .
tr	1	With my fingers running along the wall , I stumbled down the narrow hallway and into the kitchen .
tr	4	After a pretend stretch , I pulled out a butter knife from the drawer and flipped around .
tr	3	" Maybe you didn 't get the clue the other night that I 'm not interested in you . "
tr	4	With his other hand , he gently eased the knife from my grasp and laid it on the table .
tr	2	Malcolm babbled on about espionage in a newbie sort-of excited way , something about night vision goggles .
tr	2	Prize money would be offered to the contestant who made it to the finals a month from now .
tr	3	I felt like a robot , shooting out the answer to his question without any thought .
tr	3	Strangers weaved through the tables , and I wanted to scream at them to move out of the way .
tr	0	I couldn 't stop glancing at the table where Aimee and I usually sat , hoping she 'd appear .
tr	3	I longed to hold a latte , feel the warmth on my hands , a simple distraction .
tr	3	Malcolm pressed his lips together and paused , as if to stretch out my ultimate humiliation .
tr	3	My face turned the color of a crimson sunset , or that was what it felt like .
tr	0	I grabbed a small metal serving tray off a table and hit him in the stomach with it .
tr	1	I was a bit jealous of the stability of living in the same place for so long .
tr	1	If Aimee was on any kind of innocent trip , her grandmother would know about it .
tr	4	I picked it up and let the beads poke into my skin before letting them slide from my fingers .
tr	0	He wore black jeans , a black shirt , and a black ski hat pulled over his dark hair .
tr	3	" There 's the ' button hook , ' which is just bursting into the room .
tr	3	Look for anything that might be a clue -- tickets , receipts , maps , anything . "
tr	0	I ran down a hallway that branched off the living room and went back to the bedroom .
tr	1	I hadn 't planned on taking extreme invasive measures unless I found something suspicious , and I had .
tr	2	" If Peyton is our man , will we go to your dad or the French authorities ?
tr	4	I didn 't want to feel that close to someone who would just leave me later .
tr	1	Peyton 's trackers showed nothing unusual , and I had no clue what to do next .
tr	4	My gut said it was more than it seemed , and I needed to demand she tell me everything .
tr	3	Finally , after my second failed attempt at making the perfect tart , I kicked the wall .
tr	0	An hour later , Malcolm and I hobbled , arm in arm , to the Metro .
tr	0	A derby hat sat on top of his grey head , and he had a long wizard 's beard .
tr	4	I pushed my mop of grey hair out of my eyes then smoothed down the ugliest dress ever .
tr	4	I guess lots of old married couples don 't talk when they reach a certain age .
tr	0	Or coming here with her grandmother , who could fill us in on the history behind this place .
tr	1	The muscles in my legs quivered like I was trapped in a room with a mountain lion .
tr	0	Malcolm wrapped his arm around my waist , and I 'd never been so thankful for human contact .
tr	3	Then I 'd opened the package anyway and went through with the instructions to sign up for the Extravaganza .
tr	4	" After I dropped the tracking device into the lake , he must have circled back . "
tr	0	" You don 't happen to have a Hawaiian pizza in there , do you ? "
tr	0	He pulled out a handful of chocolate bars , crackers , and two small bottles of water .
tr	4	You 're the one who 's supposed to be training me to be the ultimate spy .
tr	4	For some reason , I didn 't like the idea of Malcolm on a date with anyone else .
tr	1	He put his finger under my chin and lifted my head so I was looking into his eyes .
tr	3	She didn 't trust me , and when we got shot at , I couldn 't protect her . "
tr	3	Whether or not that meant the intruder had left the room , I didn 't care .
tr	2	She spoke in French , so I just nodded my head and said , " Oui . "
tr	4	Larger square cakes were in the shape of cottages , and it was all for me .
tr	3	The instructions had failed to mention that I didn 't have to worry about my entry .
tr	4	It didn 't take long for my smile to fade as people pretty much ignored me .
tr	4	I gripped the bag over my shoulder , feeling the lumpy form of the camera against my side .
tr	1	The cold reality of prison bars , orange jumpsuits , and stale bread crusts sank into my bones .
tr	0	Back at my table , I shoved the camera into my bag and slung it over my shoulder .
tr	0	He wore a white apron , a poofy chef 's hat , and he carried a tray .
tr	0	A narrow hallway , dingy and filled with cobwebs , led to a door at the end .
tr	3	I crept down the hallway but stopped abruptly at the smell curling from the open door .
tr	2	With the door open a crack , I held onto every wisp of warmth I could get .
tr	3	The butler grumbled in French first , then said , " And what about the girl ? "
tr	2	As mini icicles formed off the tip of my nose , chairs scraped on the floor .
tr	2	I opened the door , letting in a blast of cooler air as Malcolm walked through .
tr	3	The words floated , hovering nearby , but I couldn 't quite catch them to speak .
tr	4	I loved her but I would 've appreciated more chocolate chip cookies straight from the oven . "
tr	0	That was true , but it wasn 't because she was playing leapfrog with hay bales .
tr	1	I bet he did , if his story was true about his year on his own to prove himself .
tr	0	" He may have shot at us at the park and possibly on our date . "
tr	1	I kissed the soft spot below his ear and mumbled , " Actually , I 'm just joking . "
tr	3	" I don 't think Spy Games ' clients are all that impressed with our dramatic entrance . "
tr	1	I pictured Malcolm tied up in a chair while bat turds dropped from the rafters into his hair .
tr	2	Or maybe chocolate chip cookies from his mom -- if the story about his family were true .
tr	1	His burning touches on my arm and the gentle whisper of his lips on my skin .
tr	3	Better yet , a cell phone , but he was too smart to leave that lying around .
tr	3	The voice that had once caused my heart to flutter now made it race with fury .
tr	2	" Ooh , and if I 'm right , then you take off an article of clothing . "
tr	3	Malcolm paused , probably trying to subdue the temptation to rip off all her clothes and skip the foreplay .
tr	1	" I come from a long line of assassins , going back hundreds of years . "
tr	1	I sat through various questions about family pets , siblings , childhood , and embarrassing moments .
tr	2	I could have learned more about Malcolm , but most of the words dribbling from his mouth were lies .
tr	3	Malcolm stood at the edge of the kitchen , like a cat about to eat his favorite meal .
tr	2	Somehow I had to get him away from the door so I could get out of here .
tr	2	I swiped the counters looking for something to throw at him but he was too clean .
tr	3	I kept the plate up not really sure how it could protect me but it was better than nothing .
tr	1	And don 't give me the same line about passing on information on Spy Games . "
tr	2	In the few seconds it took for him to register my actions , I booked it toward the door .
tr	0	Every few seconds , his hand would run through his hair in the typical show of male frustration .
tr	3	" I swear I 'll never hurt you , but I can 't promise that others won 't .
tr	4	Nothing registered on my face , but he 'd gone too far mocking my highly refined methods of defense .
tr	4	I 'd wanted to play dumb the whole time , but I needed to push and get a reaction .
tr	3	It had nothing to do with the fact that he had my insides tied into knots .
tr	4	I 'd hoped the girl knew something about her or had seen her on the job . "
tr	4	He rubbed his thumb over the skin of my wrist then kissed the red marks the ropes left behind .
tr	1	I didn 't trust him for half a millisecond , but I needed him to believe I did .
tr	3	Because the only way to get to the truth was to spy on the big guy himself .
tr	2	I pulled the binoculars from my bag and narrowed in on Jolie as he approached the front door .
tr	1	I leaned my head against the house , not looking , just soaking in the sounds .
tr	3	He spoke to it in soothing tones and tried to get it to eat from his hand .
tr	1	In his own environment , he seemed human , almost normal , other than acting like a bird .
tr	0	On the top of her head was a bun of white hair , wisps hanging down .
tr	2	I pulled my phone from my pocket and with one touch put it on camera mode .
tr	3	With one last shout , I let a kick fly , hoping to catch him in the stomach .
tr	0	I pressed my back up against the door , ready to kick any flying poultry that came at me .
tr	4	I breathed a sigh of relief now that the immediate threat of death by pecking had disappeared .
tr	1	If I were going to end up in a dirty henhouse again , I 'd have the basics .
tr	2	I could change and let him into my life by talking about Malcolm , or about Mom .
tr	1	I warmed them up in the microwave , not falling for Dad 's trick of changing the topic .
tr	1	While dowsing them in syrup , I said casually , " So , someone stopping by ?
tr	4	As we walked under the arches , I felt the crowbar press through the backpack into my back .
tr	0	Every man in a suit coat with a Bluetooth in his ear became a possible assassin .
tr	2	What if Jolie had goons following us with plans to shoot me down with a special camera ?
tr	3	About the money , the Extravaganza , that I had no clue what they wanted to know .
tr	3	Locked in the stall , I sat on the toilet and brought my legs up to my chest .
tr	4	Paris spread out before me with its stone buildings , lush gardens , and the Eiffel in the distance .
tr	1	How many more times would I be running for my life in this city until I found answers ?
tr	2	The living room led to an open but tiny kitchen with room for a table for four .
tr	0	Fear of getting caught spread like wildfire across my skin and I had to force a swallow .
tr	3	I slithered to the bottom of the tub and lay down , my legs bent and turned sideways .
tr	4	I rushed down the tiny hall , barely staying on my feet and crashed into the girl 's room .
tr	1	I ripped open a second drawer , fighting back tears , looking for more current pictures .
tr	4	My legs trembled , and my heart pounded as the light from Jolie 's kitchen disappeared .
tr	4	Dizziness overwhelmed me , but I fought it off with every foot of the stone circular wall that passed .
tr	1	My head banged into the rock-hard ceiling , and I bit my tongue to avoid crying out .
tr	4	Her hair seemed a bit on the fritz and her face was pale , but she was there !
tr	0	Blood rushed to my face as I realized it wasn 't a rope , but a whip .
tr	2	Or maybe Malcolm was practicing to become a cowboy and go back to the States and compete in rodeos .
tr	2	I pulled out my handy dandy flashlight and flicked it on , ready to go rescue a prisoner .
tr	4	I remembered the fear in Mom 's eyes when she talked to me at the Eiffel Tower .
tr	3	I had no choice but to run through the tunnels and hope I didn 't get lost .
tr	1	At his cowardice in not taking the high road but rather doing Jolie 's dirty work .
tr	2	You look ... " He took my appearance in , his eyes roving up and down my body .
tr	3	I bit my bottom lip so the words building , screaming to get out , wouldn 't .
tr	3	The words came out louder than I 'd meant , but I couldn 't take it anymore .
tr	3	It 's just it 's my first time , and I 'm a little nervous . "
tr	1	Finally I slumped over and put my head in my hands , not wanting to look at him .
tr	1	No lights were on , so I hoped Dad was out on official Spy Games business .
tr	2	With wrinkled skin and wearing comfy clothes , I flopped on my bed and drifted off .
tr	2	I threw the book on the floor , threw my hip out and crossed my arms .
tr	0	Was I that much of a failure that he didn 't want me on Spy Games anymore ?
tr	1	Standing in open view in front of windows didn 't seem very wise given the circumstances .
tr	1	I 'd ask him to help me in Spy Games to make up for my mistakes .
tr	0	At the same time , I could make up for my mistakes by taking action and making Dad proud .
tr	0	My way of an apology on the path to becoming a better Spy Games staffer and daughter .
tr	4	He 'd once turned that killer smile on me , and where had that gotten me ?
tr	1	With a flip of my hair , I faced him , channeling the coolness factor of an iceberg .
tr	4	The metal rafter was firm beneath my feet , and I simply refused to look down .
tr	0	Without a thought , I jumped , my arm straight out , my head held high .
tr	1	But that only counted in my book , and I wouldn 't be receiving any prizes .
tr	4	With a sigh , I realized my job was done , but my real work had yet to begin .
tr	4	If Jolie had no problem destroying something he loved -- pastries -- what would he do with me ?
tr	1	Well , he probably was a security guard , dressed in dark colors and wearing sunglasses .
tr	3	I pulled out the gadget that unlocked doors , stuck it into the keyhole , and wiggled it around .
tr	1	" I tried to convince my partner you were not an innocent victim in all this .
tr	2	" I know you hired Malcolm to take Aimee 's place so you could spy on my family . "
tr	1	When the night we 'd planned for your kidnapping went up in smoke , I made other plans . "
tr	0	He asked you out on a date and romanced you because I paid him to . "
tr	0	His mustache twitched and he ran the back of his hand across the bottom of his beard .
tr	2	So , why don 't you hand my mom over to me , and I 'll leave .
tr	1	First your mother , then you , and finally your father drawing me into his Spy Games .
tr	4	After a glance back toward the darkened tunnel , I gently shook the man 's shoulder .
tr	4	I moved to his back and pulled out the knife tucked into my sock and under my pant leg .
tr	1	The prisoner whispered out of the side of his mouth , " I 'll distract him .
tr	3	My legs twitched with the desire to follow his directions , to turn and flee up the stairs .
tr	3	I 'm not the kind of the girl who stabs men in catacombs or anywhere for that matter .
tr	1	He mumbled about finding my mom , arriving in Paris , and then Jolie finding him .
tr	1	I was wrapped in his words , hoping , wishing he knew where to find my mom .
tr	1	" I 'm listening , " I said , broken but dreading what was coming next .
tr	4	She was my first friend in France , and I didn 't get nearly enough time with her .
tr	2	I wanted to apologize for not asking more questions , for not insisting she tell me about her life .
tr	4	Before I could respond , she kissed my cheeks and left with the man leaning on her .
tr	1	I leaned over and rested my hands on my knees , breathing in and out , in and out .
tr	1	Everything I 'd worked for I had to turn away from -- vindication , justification , all of it .
tr	0	Old and young , male and female all dressed in black trench coats and yapping nervously .
tr	0	And then out of the corner of my eye , I caught a flash of dark hair .
tr	3	The M word sat in the back of my throat , and I had to take in deep breaths .
tr	1	It was a perfect distraction for me to talk to Jolie , whisper words of warning in his ear .
tr	4	The line of Jolie 's men stepped closer , their top hats blocking out the sun .
tr	3	I didn 't know what he had to do with Malcolm yet , but he was connected .
tr	2	He made a cuckoo sign , like a fourth grade boy would to a girl who teased him .
tr	3	It was a silly , two-year-old thing to do , but I couldn 't help it .
tr	3	With a flutter of his arms , he fought gravity and lost , landing on his rump .
tr	4	I hated the guy and the evil part of me surged forward and wanted to let him get killed .
tr	0	With my hand shaking , I reached toward my back and curled my fingers around the part sticking out .
tr	0	My leg throbbed as if a thousand pastry knives were jabbing into it over and over again .
tr	3	The spots returned and my breath came out in gasps at the fire shooting through my leg .
tr	4	I remembered gardening with Dad as he pointed out which leaves were weeds and which were the herbs .
tr	1	I figured on old age , still living in the ' burbs , watching TV reruns .
tr	4	I 'd never get the chance to yell at Mom and hear her say she was sorry .
tr	4	Next I knew , a bridge appeared next to me , and a jolt of pain stabbed my leg .
tr	3	I tried to scramble to my feet , but excruciating pain caused spots to tango in front of me .
tr	1	I took in a ragged breath as my body heaved , tears running , nose sniffling .
tr	4	I need to remove the clothing so we can see if the bullet is in your leg . "
tr	4	He dabbed some kind of liquid fire on me that I swear burned a hole through my leg .
tr	2	" And to threaten you , so I could save you and earn your trust . "
tr	2	But how and why Malcolm knew Peyton dropped to the bottom of my list of questions .
tr	2	I tipped my head back and the liquid scorched my throat and burned in my chest .
tr	1	" I wish I could tell you , but that would only put you in danger . "
tr	4	" If my brother , Will , wanted Jolie dead , he would 've been dead . "
tr	0	He shot at us on our date and at the park too -- as a warning to me . "
tr	4	I 've got people trying to kill -- " He pulled me to him and his mouth covered mine .
tr	1	I leaned into him for another kiss , not wanting to admit my feelings or forgive .
tr	4	" Yes , you are , I mean were ... " but he couldn 't say the words .
tr	2	I tried not to look at anyone and kept my eyes forward , thinking about home .
tr	4	I 'd bike down to the creek , shed my clothes , and wade into the ice-cold water .
tr	0	I doubted my prank on Malcolm had ended up with him in the back of a squad car .
tr	4	Reviews are a tremendous help to the author but mostly it helps other readers to find books .
tr	4	If you enjoyed A Spy Like Me , then you might enjoy my latest YA romantic comedy series .
tr	4	And my cousin , Jules , was in an all out war with the senior class queen bee .
tr	2	" Um , do you think what we did could be considered more than a prank ?
tr	4	A sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach mushroomed into the need to puke behind the bushes .
tr	1	I 'll go start the car ... " Nothing I said would 've changed her mind .
tr	3	The heat of getting caught flared and my armpit sweat morphed from a trickling stream into a river .
tr	2	Why hadn 't we picked English Lit so I could hold up a slim copy of poetry ?
tr	4	I produced a few crocodile tears , which wasn 't hard , because I was in complete panic mode .
tr	0	That was when I realized that what I mistook for compassion was really an amused curiosity .
tr	3	" Why don 't we take a little ride and you can explain your story down at the station .
tr	4	To keep up with her new releases sign up for her newsletter so you don 't miss out !
tr	4	Scott looked up to see a massive black bear on his hind legs less than twenty feet ahead .
tr	3	That usually got their attention and the animal would wander off , allowing the work to continue .
tr	2	Scott decided that maybe he had done enough bulldozing for today and climbed onto the dozer .
tr	3	Scott put the rifle back in the closet as he told the story of what had happened .
tr	3	What I want to know is what that white thing was and what hit the rifle . "
tr	3	But I saw something off to my right , either in the underbrush or at the edge of it .
tr	3	" The top of this barrel is unlatched and moved over slightly but nothing inside was disturbed . "
tr	2	He took a bite of cookie then a sip of milk as his gaze continued to wander lazily .
tr	2	It looked and moved almost in ghost-like fashion but he was sure it was not a ghost .
tr	0	Scott shot a quick glance toward the doorway and recognized the faint shape of a shadow .
tr	3	The following morning , just after sunrise , Steve and Scott Lyndon went out to the garbage drums .
tr	1	" What in the hell is a child doing living out here in the forest ? "
tr	3	It might have been digging out food and feeding the child with what it brought out . "
tr	3	Later that afternoon , he returned to the drums to find the apple was still there .
tr	3	Of course it wouldn 't since there was always so much activity around the yard in the daytime .
tr	0	" Food , " he said again and saw her gaze dart to the bag then back .
tr	0	He saw her look at the bag again and he smiled then gave a slight nod .
tr	0	If it takes facing down a bear again to see that she does , I will .
tr	2	" You 're probably right , " Scott said and followed his brother to the front door .
tr	2	Scott froze his motions as he swiveled his head slowly and looked in the direction of the growl .
tr	3	But that still doesn 't get us any closer to finding out who she is . "
tr	2	" You 're gon na try to get a wild coyote out of a bear trap ?
tr	3	But this little girl is sitting here petting the coyote and he 's not objecting . "
tr	3	" Get me a stick to put in this thing , " he told his brother .
tr	0	" I 'm going to take him down to the camp and bandage his paw . "
tr	4	" I think you 're nuts , " he grumbled before he stepped up to the driver 's door .
tr	3	To Scott 's surprise , she climbed into the bed of the truck and came toward him .
tr	4	When she lifted her gaze and looked at him then looked at the bear he realized she did .
tr	3	I 'll stay in the truck with them and you go get that med kit . "
tr	4	Steve perched his arms on the fender and watched , keeping a sideways eye on the nearby bear .
tr	0	She 's familiar with that area and might consider it safer than any place else here . "
tr	3	After another smile at the little girl Scott turned and followed his brother toward the cabin .
tr	2	" Nobody move , " Scott called in a little louder tone , glancing from Chet to Doug .
tr	4	It was almost a full minute later when Chet reported , " Here she is . "
tr	3	" She 's untying my boot , " he told the man at the end of the jam .
tr	1	Scott tried to keep his frown inside but failed and it creased his brow with confusion .
tr	4	He searched her blue eyes to see a gleam sparkle to life as a soft smile touched her lips .
tr	1	Again , to his surprise , the animal responded with a soft growl before it sank to its haunches .
tr	4	" Wait here , " he told her and picked up the tray before he got to his feet .
tr	4	Steve Lyndon turned from the coffee pot , a fresh cup of coffee in his hand .
tr	2	" Good idea , " Scott said and headed for a door in the opposite wall .
tr	3	It was a silent ride that had Sidney looking back through the window often to check on her pets .
tr	3	But across the gorge to the east , it was nothing but a sheer mountain cliff .
tr	0	He heard a low throaty growl and looked at his cargo at the same time Sidney did .
tr	4	Never in his wildest dreams did he think he would be hauling around a coyote and a black bear .
tr	3	The going was easy at first but , a few minutes later the hill started sloping downward .
tr	3	Scott watched the little girl move down the slope easily and thought she looked like a mountain goat .
tr	1	Another growl , this one more of a cry and the bear responded with a warbling growl .
tr	4	I doubt I 'll be able to get out while we 're down there though . "
tr	4	" I 've left the truck just beyond the end of fire lane forty-four , in the preserve .
tr	2	" I don 't know how long it 's going to take to get down there .
tr	3	When it came up with a snake in its mouth Scott 's eyes shot to full width .
tr	3	After checking the pockets of the jacket Scott put everything back into the backpack and zipped it up .
tr	4	She frowned for a moment before her hand went to her backside , where a wallet would be placed .
tr	4	He saw Sidney 's gaze slide along the mountains as deep crevices furrowed her tiny forehead .
tr	4	It was a beautiful locket ; simple yet elegant with tiny scrolls on the front of the heart-shaped piece .
tr	0	On one side was a man and a woman ; a handsome couple , and they were smiling .
tr	3	On the other side was a little boy and girl and Scott 's eyes shot to full width .
tr	4	Scott nodded and looked at the picture again then closed the locket and smiled at the innocent eyes .
tr	3	She emitted a soft gurgling cry and the coyote moved past them and took the point again .
tr	2	How was he going to get these people up out of this gorge and buried without raising suspicions ?
tr	3	" Sorry , " Scott said and glanced at his watch and realized they were almost thirty minutes late .
tr	4	He could not lie to her , not when he had come so far in reaching her .
tr	0	He heard her sigh and his heart went out to the little blonde haired girl that had no family .
tr	3	But I think I know of a way to get the ball rolling and still protect her . "
tr	1	She said she had taken some of her Mommy 's t-shirts and that 's all she has on . "
tr	3	" I 'm not sure they 'll fit but I think they 'll be close . "
tr	3	" I 'm just not ready to face him yet , " Scott said after they had driven away .
tr	3	" Yeah , " Scott said blandly as he turned his attention to the country roads .
tr	3	Steve swung the truck off the main highway and onto the gravel road that led to the camp .
tr	2	" You can almost feel the chill of fall in the air , " he commented casually .
tr	3	" I noticed that this morning when I went out to get Sidney 's tray . "
tr	3	In the distance , a movement on the high bank to the left caught Scott 's eye .
tr	3	The animal emitted another small throaty growl before it sank to its haunches then laid down .
tr	3	He was sure the little girl was not too comfortable about him being there and he understood that .
tr	4	He examined the picture and matched it with the one he had seen in the locket .
tr	4	He stuffed it back under the license then turned the wallet and checked under the photo compartment .
tr	3	I am sorry , Mr. and Mrs. Southington but I see no other avenue at this time .
tr	1	Sidney Southington , now Sidney Lyndon , had grown up to be a beautiful young woman .
tr	3	The next spring , Scott and Sidney had gone through the motorhome , taking what Sidney wanted to keep .
tr	2	" Doug wants to know if you want him to bring those logs down from the south slope . "
tr	2	Scott looked up to see his brother come in from the hallway and go straight to the coffee pot .
tr	2	" Well , you know that new guy who bought out the old Cummings ranch ? "
tr	0	Josh ran his fingers through the thick bush of gray hair that covered the top of his head .
tr	3	" That little filly could set half the county in their place and not even half try . "
tr	2	" Two men in it , both had cowboy hats on , something like Josh wears but dark brown .
tr	4	" You 're up early , " he noted as he went to the coffee pot .
tr	1	Scott was almost afraid to ask his next question as he sank to the table across from his sister .
tr	3	He attributed it to her love of and rapport with wild animals and left it at that .
tr	3	I 'd need a positive ID but he 's right at the top of my suspect list . "
tr	0	" We can replace the glass by noon and trespassing isn 't that big of a deal .
tr	1	When he saw a dark blue Ford four by four come around the corner Scott 's gaze narrowed .
tr	0	He was a relatively handsome man and Scott thought he walked like a city boy in cowboy duds .
tr	3	Not only a pack of wild coyotes with their teeth barred , but this beautiful woman .
tr	1	" You took away her hunting ground with your damned ranches , " the woman snarled .
tr	1	He knew what Sidney was going through and he also knew what Dan Jansen was going through .
tr	4	He doubted if she would have him helping her feed the pups if she hadn 't .
tr	1	And , when it was kindled , as it was this evening , it was like a raging wildfire .
tr	4	" You 'll feed Tip , " she told Jansen and handed him one of the bottles .
tr	1	" Do it just like I do , " she told him succinctly then watched him mimic her actions .
tr	1	he snapped and was on his feet instantly , clutching the coyote pup in his hand .
tr	3	I hope it encourages others to make their own determinations about everything ... or at least try to .
tr	0	His dirty complexion and half-inch beard growth gave hint that he had dwelled in these woods for days .
tr	0	He was angry and it was getting cold when he saw a large lump in the path ahead .
tr	2	She had the option of going either before or after school , but she always did both .
tr	2	Outside her room the upstairs hallway formed a balcony which overlooked the entryway , kitchen , and dining room .
tr	4	" Good morning , sunshine , " Rick said as he poured them each a glass of orange juice .
tr	0	Alex was shocked that he had the information in his head , " How did you know that ? "
tr	4	" You told me you worked on the fly three hours a day , Dad , " she argued .
tr	1	When I was twelve I was shooting things with my BB gun and blowing up stuff with firecrackers . "
tr	4	Rick was still pondering their conversation when she flew past him and out the kitchen door to the garage .
tr	4	She slung her backpack over her shoulder , hopped on her bike , and sped off to practice .
tr	4	Jessie lay sprawled across the bed , face down , half a leg and arm hanging over the side .
tr	2	" You have to grow up sometime ; lord knows the rest of you is ... " She moaned .
tr	4	Alex could beat her in those too , but chose to enter the distance races for freestyle and butterfly .
tr	2	Another mile through the trail put them in the middle of town , one block from school .
tr	0	Alex took advantage and sped by , claiming victory and taunting her as they stopped to chain their bikes .
tr	2	Unofficially retired , at 72 years old , he was fairly tall and still well built .
tr	3	He was bald with a fluffy white ring of hair that always seemed to stick straight out .
tr	3	This went on for several minutes until they had over thirty questions scribbled hastily by a happy Christy .
tr	0	The same boy was still standing and asked , " Um , what assignment was that ? "
tr	2	You spend half your time at my house hanging over his shoulder drooling on him . "
tr	3	Kaylie stuck out her tongue at both of them this time and went back to eating .
tr	3	The goalie came running out to try to stop the pass , but it was too late .
tr	4	" Becky Sanders is our long jump ; she won the state meet last year at it .
tr	3	" That 's why you flip your legs over at the end ; that will carry you over .
tr	3	This is perfect , the coach thought , she would have to do it correctly now to succeed .
tr	4	He showed her a few more times how to do it properly , knocking the bar down twice himself .
tr	0	It appeared to be a holographic baseball card or something , but was too shiny for that .
tr	3	They continued to race through each stroke ; the girls almost beat the boys in the backstroke .
tr	4	Alex put her friend through several workouts to strengthen her arms and the other muscles used in each stroke .
tr	1	Ten minutes of inspection later , Jodie announced , " I know what this is ! "
tr	2	" You 're gon na break it , " Jodie apologized and bent down to pick it up .
tr	3	It took a chip out of the concrete but there 's not a scratch on the box .
tr	0	Alex threw her clothes at her , " Hurry up , brush your hair on the way home .
tr	2	I can 't wait to play this one when you finish it , it looks soooo cool ! "
tr	3	It was quite an in-depth strategy game stuffed with actual history and just what he and Kaylie both loved .
tr	4	" I just ran home from practice -- am I supposed to smell like flowers ? "
tr	1	While this -- " a picture of a mother with a girl and boy , about eight and five .
tr	3	" Wait till I tell Christy , her assignment was to find out if they played sports . "
tr	4	Jessie chimed in , " She did -- she even jumped higher than Coach Simmons ! "
tr	1	She 's usually home by now , " Rick asked , getting nothing but shrugs in reply .
tr	3	All the girls took turns speculating , fantasizing and theorizing as to the origins and contents of it .
tr	4	They were so finely crafted by samurai sword makers or something that they appeared to have no seams .
tr	3	But if you applied just the right pressure on the right places it would slide apart or something .
tr	2	" You know how CDs or computer chips would look to someone a hundred years ago ?
tr	2	You may be right , any of us could be right , or we could all be way wrong .
tr	1	I actually know experts on this sort of thing and it sounds like a viable possibility .
tr	3	The far wall contained the bathroom and laundry , with a hot-tub between the two smaller rooms .
tr	3	A two-foot round pillar in the middle was the only obstruction in the fifty by thirty room .
tr	4	The biggest problem is they basically vanished , or at least abandoned their temples and cities .
tr	3	She had a disarming smile that instilled instant trust among the otherwise hard , sculpted features .
tr	4	Even though she 'd directed the question at Anna , all the girls shook their heads no .
tr	0	" Enough of the history lesson , let 's hear what you think and why , " Abby insisted .
tr	3	They said their goodbyes to Walt , and Abby and Rick instantly went back to the video link .
tr	1	" I wish I could answer that for sure , honey , but my guess is yes . "
tr	2	" I love all of you and still have room for Abby too , " he winked at her .
tr	3	Everything points to the Mayans being from the future if you look at it all that way .
tr	3	Rick shouted , twisting the enigmatic object from the two as they fought for control of it .
tr	4	" Wait , you 're saying it could have been from the past , future , and aliens ?
tr	1	Abby stumbled for a reply , figuring none of the children had any , " Um , nothing really .
tr	0	At least it was pimped out with a DVD player and an X-box , he mused .
tr	3	The cube suddenly started to vibrate , and Jessica hastily dumped it on the table , backing off slightly .
tr	4	Each of the girls , except Alex , picked up a necklace and checked them out .
tr	0	Abby hopped in Rick 's chair as he stood behind her with his hands on her shoulders .
tr	1	" Rob , the coin is gold -- Spanish , I think -- 250 years old .
tr	1	He didn 't respond for a few seconds , then " What condition is that coin in ? "
tr	0	First , a nose appeared , and then backed off to reveal a man of about 25 years .
tr	3	Within the next couple days -- " Alex adjusted the display , zooming out and rotating around the room .
tr	4	" -- this concludes our test of the Universal Chronicler , " the man ended and the menu appeared .
tr	1	" I was planning on sneaking into the cave tonight -- it 's been eleven , no twelve days .
tr	2	he bellowed as the doctor stood frozen until the figure took off in the opposite direction .
tr	0	" Thank God he 's as bad at tracking as he is at physics , " Taylor muttered painfully .
tr	4	Once opened , you could see the other three necklaces , the stone and the chronicler .
tr	4	He stopped momentarily to catch his breath ; it seemed incredibly difficult to speak each word .
tr	1	To end a trip , simply hold it in your hand and say ' return . '
tr	3	" OK , let 's watch a movie , " Rick attempted to change the subject .
tr	4	Kaylie and Alex walked over to the fridge while Anna stuck a movie in the player .
tr	1	Without complaint , Rick slid out , leaving Alex to right herself , pulling Abby along with him .
tr	0	" Go ahead , I couldn 't read it right now anyway , " she said , swaying groggily .
tr	1	I pulled off property details , which is kind of standard if you 're planning a dig .
tr	4	It may be a wildlife preserve or something odd , but I 'll send the info ! "
tr	3	" All I can tell is that it 's completely grown over -- you got the picture .
tr	2	Alex feigned shock , " Why , I was only going to serve your breakfast to you , sir !
tr	3	" We will all go to the track meet and the game , no question about it .
tr	0	Rick held out the phone and stared at it as if it had grown arms and slapped him .
tr	2	I received information that your foundation is over two hundred years old and I wish to learn about it .
tr	4	If I sell the land , the endowment goes to charity and I lose my job .
tr	4	I hear the caves are fairly interesting and completely stable ; otherwise , it 's just a steep hillside .
tr	3	I hope to check the place out today , it 's all so intriguing to me ! "
tr	4	They placed their order and walked over to the van to give the girls their food .
tr	0	We 've always assumed all the dinosaurs had scales , but half of them had fur .
tr	3	It 's all in the instructions but I haven 't tried any of it yet . "
tr	2	" You 're lucky I have food in my hands or I 'd kick your butt ! "
tr	3	Christy tried to zoom in on it , but couldn 't tell exactly what was going on .
tr	3	He pulled it out and hit the button to answer but continued to watch the race .
tr	3	" Well , I guess so , but it 's really important that you see it , too . "
tr	4	he asked , knowing the girls tended to put false weight on things in their lives .
tr	2	You 'd kill me if I ran off during one of your races , wouldn 't you ? "
tr	3	It hit them hard ; I wonder what else they might witness on that thing ? "
tr	1	" You already laid out rules for that , Rick , and those girls rarely ever break your rules .
tr	2	Some things like that may be a bit too gory or violent for you , " Rick worried .
tr	2	Like if you get shot , it can only tell if you will be killed instantly from that wound .
tr	3	" I intend to find out everything we can about that ; just be patient honey .
tr	0	" Yeah , but it 's high school and I 'm just a freshman , " Anna spat back .
tr	1	Rick grinned , " If you were hit by a car you 'd wish I 'd been paranoid . "
tr	1	After taking orders , she sped off to the concession stand with Christy and Jessica trailing behind .
tr	1	Besides , I want to get there as soon as possible , don 't you all ? "
tr	2	" Well , I want to go as much as they do ; heck , probably more !
tr	2	We don 't even know what we will find or what we are looking for . "
tr	3	He also stuck a distress transmitter into his pants pocket , not sure if it would even work underground .
tr	4	I 'll be swinging this around at weeds and briars and whatever else gets in our way . "
tr	2	He motioned to Abby , " OK , show me which direction we need to go . "
tr	4	Anna interrupted , and quickly drew her initial on the wall , which prompted Jessica to take some pictures .
tr	3	It 's obvious it 's not natural , but what in particular is weird about it ? "
tr	2	" How far down have we come and how far do we need to go ? "
tr	4	They went down the opposite path , which was nearly identical in length , and did the same .
tr	4	Let 's head home and try to figure it out later -- after ice cream . "
tr	3	" But there 's a five foot drop-off -- that wouldn 't be easy to navigate .
tr	0	" Because you 're almost as big as I am , and you 're actually awake !
tr	2	" Come on , girls , " he said softly to the others , and they followed .
tr	0	She gave him a weak hug and said thanks as he covered her up and said good night .
tr	3	She bent down to test the water , making it look more difficult than it was .
tr	3	I wouldn 't even talk to my own mother about personal things at her age . "
tr	3	" I was just saying I 'm going to print out all those pictures of that hallway .
tr	4	All the bathers looked at each other with deep concern that Abby had flipped her lid completely .
tr	4	Check this out , right here , where the missing path is that leads to the X , see ?
tr	1	" I think I 'm going to bed ... " Abby said , stifling a yawn .
tr	0	Kaylie asked her as if she had to be an alien to do such a thing .
tr	1	Alex came down in her nightshirt with two bags of chips , Kaylie followed with cups of ice .
tr	4	" Of course , just don 't expect all your dreams to come true , " he said carefully .
tr	2	" Oh , come on ; you know I 'm just fascinated with history -- like you .
tr	2	" You know what would really be the coolest thing in the world , Rick ? "
tr	0	" If you didn 't have parents already , I 'd adopt you , Kaylie . "
tr	1	Anna smirked , " What makes you think we 'll find anything but dead-end tunnels again today ? "
tr	1	Rick smiled at Abby , who sat in the passenger seat holding two boxes of donuts .
tr	3	Rick popped the hatch as the girls opened the sliding door and started to run down the path .
tr	4	We 'll just stay here until you are , then , " he told them all .
tr	0	Anna automatically wielded her chalk , Jessica prepared the camera and Alex and Christy illuminated the room .
tr	1	Rick held his light at an angle to the wall , which immediately made the impression visible .
tr	4	This tunnel was as wide as ten feet in some places , narrow as three feet in others .
tr	0	Rick asked Abby as he slid his arm around her shoulder and cinched her up against him .
tr	0	This can 't be another dead -- " Abby 's analysis was broken by a screech and gasp .
tr	3	" Uh , yeah ... " " That same amount of water is going out that hole .
tr	4	He determined it was no good -- he couldn 't fasten the rope to it in any way .
tr	1	" Not at all , there 's been no tension on it at all since he went in . "
tr	0	As his head broke the surface , an angry voice assaulted him , " Richard Williamson !
tr	0	Kaylie was giggling , but shook her head , assuring Abby there was no evil plot against her .
tr	1	" I might misunderstand your concern and think it 's some other emotion , " he hinted .
tr	4	Twenty minutes and probably 150 pictures later , he decided he should get back to show everyone .
tr	0	And he should ask you to -- " " What did he say about that ? "
tr	0	Kaylie was amused at Abby , acting like a high school girl with a crush on the quarterback .
tr	3	Alex angrily swam back and started to get out , but then slumped back into the water .
tr	0	Jessica and Christy jumped in with a splash to join Alex , and Anna followed shortly .
tr	4	" I 'm gon na leave this burning so we 'll have some light when we come back . "
tr	4	He shoved her up and out of the water , where she began spitting and crying .
tr	4	He wove his hand into her free hand , pulling her in the direction of the ramp .
tr	1	It is actually derived from the initials , TDM , which stands for time displacement machine .
tr	2	You can call me T if you like ; John always does ... or did . "
tr	0	I can tell if you are facing me , but that does not always mean you are addressing me .
tr	0	If you know the exact coordinates of the location as well as an altitude , you can say it .
tr	2	Use your hand to slide the view -- one finger to zoom in , two to zoom out .
tr	4	" No , I cannot , Rick , " she answered just as evenly as everything else .
tr	2	Rick furrowed his eyebrows in incomprehension , " Why would I want to learn about that ? "
tr	1	Again , he sensed an urging in her total lack of tone , like a hint .
tr	0	" I am programmed to speak to you in whatever vernacular you would most easily understand , Rick . "
tr	4	She paused , switched the display to show a 3D image of a memory crystal , a red one .
tr	2	I would guess that someone using four different colors would do so for a cheap dramatic effect . "
tr	1	Rick was quickly figuring out that T was on his side , helping him ... and enjoying it .
tr	4	However slight the effects , the launching of the missile itself seriously contaminates the time-line . "
tr	4	The floors and walls were two different shades of marble with large rugs covering most of the floor .
tr	2	" It said ' he wore a diamond of yellow ' so why are you looking through his room ?
tr	0	" I 'd like to talk about this first , maybe we 're getting carried away already .
tr	2	Alex was busy , mostly ignoring the conversation taking place , following Octavian all over Rome .
tr	2	" T can probably zap her memory out of her for you , " Jessica joked .
tr	4	Kaylie began learning to use the console controls , quickly resuming where her friend had left off .
tr	3	" T , " he turned to ask , " is that fifteen minutes missing from history altogether ? "
tr	1	They found boots , shoes , dresses , pottery , tools , jewels , and gems .
tr	1	" Uh , yeah , there 's no way I 'm going out in public with this on ! "
tr	2	" Who do you know that ever got shot by an arrow at a playground ? "
tr	2	" That 's a good reason not to let you go , " Rick decided easily .
tr	0	" Rick , she 's right , and they would have so much fun , " Abby chimed in .
tr	0	Abby simply smiled at him to let him know she thought he had done the right thing .
tr	3	He blinked a couple times , " That was too easy ; what 's the catch ? "
tr	4	" A little birdie made me realize some things today ... " she said , glancing over at Kaylie .
tr	4	" I translate the language both here and in the other time-space , Rick , " she answered .
tr	4	While they ate , the talk was excited , vibrant , focused on the mission ahead .
tr	1	Jessica was still taunting her , shaking her head around wildly with her tongue sticking out , flopping around .
tr	3	Chapter 15 -- A Little Trip to Rome " Do you confirm this destination and location , Rick ? "
tr	4	Some of the gems also made the Hope Diamond look like a $ 99 engagement ring .
tr	1	The elder boy , on the right , had short , dark hair , and dark brown eyes .
tr	3	" Then she shall be furious at me , and you won 't starve tonight ! "
tr	1	It was a rich dark brown color with lighter tan strips of leather hanging from it .
tr	1	" Lucius said to bring you this -- he 's too busy crying like a baby . "
tr	2	You could get lost or killed if you don 't know what you 're doing . "
tr	3	Another pair of eyes wouldn 't hurt , " he said , adjusting his outfit a little .
tr	3	His daughter appraised him carefully , " Well , if you want the truth , it looks pretty stupid .
tr	4	She snapped out of her daydream about the last time she had seen her father in that outfit .
tr	3	I never thought how difficult that could be -- " " No , it 's OK .
tr	1	He began fumbling in his pouch until he found a similar stone , pulling it out to show .
tr	4	" Nonsense , if I was in danger of dying the necklaces would have recalled us already .
tr	0	Alex clutched the basket in her arms as if hiding behind it and adamantly shook her head no .
tr	3	Blood ran all the way to his ankle , but otherwise it didn 't appear to be too bad .
tr	3	" You don 't want to do that , you have open wounds , " Christy stated .
tr	2	They wrapped the blanket around Rick 's body and over his head to form a hood .
tr	1	He slouched over like an old man , hobbling along convincingly , thanks to his injuries .
tr	0	Half a minute passed quite anxiously before they saw a dark form approaching them , jogging .
tr	0	She whirled and slammed the door , catching him off balance and knocking him back a few steps .
tr	4	Kaylie slumped down on the toilet seat , sniffling , crossing her arms over her chest .
tr	0	She stood and took as much of his weight as she could , helping him back to the table .
tr	2	These girls have been up for over 24 hours and you 're in no condition to do anything ! "
tr	1	" I think we 've proven this is a bit too dangerous -- " Rick tried .
tr	2	I know four of you are going to bed as soon as we get home , " Abby determined .
tr	0	The kids would put trash , dishes , food or anything else in it and watch it gradually disappear .
tr	0	" You 'd have to ask them that , Abby , I can only speculate . "
tr	2	You know I 'm almost as strong a swimmer as you , " Alex offered helpfully .
tr	1	Rick limped out of the bathroom and saw all six pairs of eyes impatiently waiting for him .
tr	4	When I move my stuff down here , it 's yours , " Abby told her .
tr	0	She splashed him , " I thought we had more important things to do right now ? "
tr	3	But , let 's see who can make it back out with no help at all , OK ? "
tr	4	His energy was fading quickly and he wasn 't sure how much longer he would last .
tr	4	When they finally arrived at the van , Rick sprawled across the back seat while the girls loaded everything .
tr	0	Anna grabbed her by the arm and dragged her into the house as Abby and Alex aided Rick .
tr	0	" Night , Dad , " Alex said sleepily , as she gave a hug and a quick kiss .
tr	2	" Sorry girls , you still have school tomorrow ... " The trio trudged upstairs to the showers .
tr	0	Abby looked at the screen , " Aah , you 've already found it all ? "
tr	1	As he felt the surreal slipping away to consciousness , he realized it wasn 't just a fantasy .
tr	2	Now available Chronicles of Time : Book 3 Chapter 29 -- Can You be Born Before You 're Born ?
tr	1	" It seems nobody truly knows when Jesus was born , " he said with a sigh .
tr	3	I want to park a bit away instead of pulling up to the house , " Scott said .
tr	2	In all my years , I 've never heard of a woman being so bold for so long .
tr	3	Sorry to punch you in the feminism , but women just don 't behave this way . "
tr	1	I 'm just saying we shouldn 't be so harsh on the suspect this time . "
tr	1	Scott grinned , then got out , talking into his microphone , " Is anyone inside ? "
tr	4	The edging along the walk and driveway seemed to have been accomplished with the precision of a scalpel .
tr	1	This has ' innocent victim ' written all over it , " he said , standing aside .
tr	3	They had mastered the world of digital communication , but had lost the ability to communicate with each other .
tr	0	He and Reed appeared to be the last two dinosaurs that had broken away from that path .
tr	1	Any resemblance to real persons , living or dead , is an amazing coincidence and nothing more .
tr	0	She clawed at the sand and crawled away from the plane as fast as she could .
tr	1	The giant 's arm was bulging with corded muscles beneath skin from which sprouted wiry , black hair .
tr	1	Five riders , racing through the desert , weaving in and out , jumping slight rises .
tr	4	Behind them , the riders left behind not only their camp , but twelve years of education .
tr	4	Still , when they all went their separate ways in a few months , Josie would miss them .
tr	0	The man was leaning back against the boat , his shirt and one boot burnt off .
tr	3	The boys all nodded to each other and turned from the boat wreck then started back to their motorcycles .
tr	0	Josie watched as the water began to wash away ash and soot , revealing gray beneath .
tr	4	She couldn 't get the image of the burned , stone man out of her mind .
tr	2	" You know , Josie , if you 're scared , I could keep you company tonight . "
tr	0	For her , that meant a sharp inhalation of air , and her eyes wide open .
tr	4	Jimmy immediately tripped over the many empty water bottles and fell onto his face in the sand .
tr	0	Logan suddenly flew backwards , nearly a dozen feet , collapsing a tent and landing with a heavy thud .
tr	2	Jimmy rebounded off the shirtless stranger , falling backwards to land roughly on his own bottom .
tr	1	He was very surprised as the blood in his hand soaked into his palm and vanished .
tr	1	Logan was lying in the tent , trying not to make noise , but holding his side .
tr	4	Mark eyed the kids carefully , for the first time really taking in their off-road motocross clothes .
tr	1	" You 're trying to figure out what year this is , " Jimmy said in surprise .
tr	4	Once closed the wound turned back to the same tanned flesh tone as the rest of Mark 's skin .
tr	0	The door opened and Maria finally came out , brushing her long , wavy , black hair .
tr	0	Maria hadn 't had a vacation , hadn 't walked outside the facility , in years .
tr	0	Maria picked up a piece of toast from the table , while Mark sat down across from her .
tr	0	" I know how much you like the story of the bread and the fish , " Maria said .
tr	0	" That werewolf bite a few years ago didn 't affect you , " Maria said calmly .
tr	3	They both covered the area of the hallway with their guns - but it was still clear .
tr	4	Midway down the hall , the chamber 's heavy blast door popped open a few inches .
tr	3	A purple , forked tongue darted in and out of the lizard 's mouth as it tasted the air .
tr	0	Mark already had his Thompson up , held tight against his shoulder , lining his sights up .
tr	0	It roared in anger then turned toward the far end of hall and Mark and Maria .
tr	0	Maria stepped forward , lifting her shotgun to her shoulder as her husband had taught her .
tr	4	The massive deer slug went wide , missing the charging basilisk and tearing a chunk out of the wall .
tr	2	He 'd ditched his one boot , and stood barefoot in the sand , in only his combat pants .
tr	0	That really irritated Jimmy , now wearing sneakers , khaki pants and an untucked , gray , short-sleeve shirt .
tr	1	She now wore short , blue jean shorts , a bright , pink t-shirt and leather sandals .
tr	4	" You 're welcome , " Mark replied , turning to go get Josie 's motorcycle .
tr	2	Josie decided it was time to drop it , before Carlos and Logan came to blows .
tr	0	When he was out of earshot , Kendall and Logan turned around to glare at Carlos .
tr	2	" But no , we 're going to go find some cops and report this . "
tr	3	Back at Jimmy 's truck , Mark climbed into the cab , sitting in the front passenger seat .
tr	3	As it fell , the heart quickly turned back to stone , landing with a thud in the sand .
tr	1	" Your dad died fighting a fire , you meet this guy - who died in a fire . "
tr	1	We sure didn 't have people using abilities in public , back in ' 62 . "
tr	3	Why couldn 't they just drop this guy somewhere and get on with their summer vacation ?
tr	3	He didn 't want to offer , but at least it would keep Mark away from Josie .
tr	3	It wasn 't quite the progress she 'd hoped for , but it was a start .
tr	0	The second agent walked to the table and sat down across from Carlos , Kendall and Logan .
tr	4	The teens sat this way , rigid , for several seconds while the agent watched them .
tr	4	Several seconds later , the teens went slack - falling forward , their heads hitting the table .
tr	1	The Sentinel started off flashy - a garish costume and stopping a bank robber in downtown Los Angeles .
tr	1	Some stuck to show business - headlining in Vegas , making documentaries and even half-hour children 's shows .
tr	3	It sounded familiar , but he was still trying to process this whole caped , costumed thing .
tr	0	Josie dug in one bag and pulled out a pair of black flip flops and handed them to Mark .
tr	3	They were walking up to Jimmy 's truck , talking to each other and watching Josie .
tr	1	Pete balled his fists and took a step toward Josie , his face showing his anger .
tr	0	" We should probably go , " Mark said as he slid back into the truck .
tr	4	The large room held at least thirty soldiers , airmen and sailors , feverishly working at computer consoles .
tr	2	" Two locals thrown around like rag dolls - injuries that seem out of the ordinary .
tr	1	" Hey , I 've been driving for hours and I 'm starving , " Jimmy said .
tr	3	" 532 , our instructions are to remain in the area but do not make contact . "
tr	2	Josie took a short sleeve shirt down off a rack and held it up to Mark .
tr	1	" I think you like him , " Jimmy said , spelling it out for her .
tr	0	Mark looked down at his clothes and shifted his weight back and forth in the tennis shoes .
tr	0	Across the food court , Jimmy and Josie balanced their trays carefully as they walked back to Mark .
tr	3	He says he needs to talk to you - the big guy with the flattop . "
tr	0	Mark nodded his head affirmatively , " If that 's what this is called - then yes . "
tr	0	" I don 't think they have clearance for this , Colonel , " Major Campbell said in frustration .
tr	3	" Isn 't it still illegal to do this - take over someone 's mind like that ? "
tr	0	" And I do not like him that way , " she added , pointing a thumb at Mark .
tr	4	He took a perverse joy in revealing things like this when he took over people 's minds and bodies .
tr	0	Mark placed his hands on the table , palms down , and turned to regard Agent Cooper .
tr	0	This was not the day he 'd had in mind when he got up this morning .
tr	3	He 'd had the necessary training , but he really didn 't want to put it to the test .
tr	0	" My friends and I are going to walk out of here , " Mark said calmly .
tr	0	All the agents started in fear , each taking a step back and nearly drawing their pistols .
tr	1	Mark carried Jimmy over his shoulder , while Josie carried Mark 's shopping bag of clothes .
tr	0	Mark reached up and tore the darts free with his left hand while he held Jimmy with his right .
tr	2	He struck one on the top of the helmet , hopefully only hard enough to knock the man unconscious .
tr	3	Outside the cloud of teargas , which was just beginning to dissipate , a third agent stepped into view .
tr	2	Josie stood by the open front door of the truck and pulled the gas mask off her head .
tr	2	Before Mark could respond , a loop of steel cable dropped down on him , seemingly from above .
tr	4	The loop immediately tightened , pinning his arms , just above the elbows , to his sides .
tr	3	" Pleased to meet you , but I 'm busy right -- " he started to say .
tr	1	The back of his shirt was melted and smoldering , his skin showing through in several places .
tr	0	Then a stream of water shot up into the air from the patch of ground she had already damaged .
tr	4	Her incoherent ramblings , possibly in Latin , gave way to heated protest as the two ended up face-to-face .
tr	0	Jimmy glanced down , and realized he was wearing a black suit , white shirt and tie .
tr	1	" Hey , sport , " Mark said , reaching down and picking up a bottle of suntan lotion .
tr	3	Jimmy started to panic and tried to put the smoke out by slapping at his arms and legs .
tr	4	" I can 't believe the government has a telepath - and a sorceress , " Josie said .
tr	3	We think - thought - it was in Arizona to assume the Vice President 's identity .
tr	3	" It rips the hearts out of living subjects and consumes them , then takes their form . "
tr	1	A being capable of taking the identity of a victim - of many , many victims .
tr	0	His shirt was skin-tight , black - made of a material similar to what standard troops wore .
tr	4	Echo absolutely understood the importance of stopping the creature and whatever plan it had in place .
tr	0	Ted Marshall was a middle-aged salesman from Oklahoma , on his way back from a convention in Las Vegas .
tr	3	It struck him how odd it was that a telepath should even have to use a radio .
tr	1	The earpiece picked up his words and transmitted them in burst form - a split-second digital transmission .
tr	3	The United States military had spent years trying to develop a super soldier for any situation .
tr	3	Atlas didn 't know it , but she had been a drug addict on the streets of Oklahoma .
tr	0	Each individual round of the weapon was designed to be able to kill a man , or woman .
tr	4	Then it dropped to the ground , as if the machine guns had been suspending it .
tr	4	As he jerked back on the neck , he jammed the knife into the creature 's back .
tr	0	After striking the man , she had leapt from her car in a panic to check on him .
tr	4	He 'd scored a direct hit , but he knew the shapeshifter was only slowed down .
tr	3	Turning into a giant just meant his enemy was a bigger , easier to hit target .
tr	4	He wondered if he was actually salivating at the thought of all the power the heart held .
tr	3	He was just about to put it into his mouth when he noticed it had changed color .
tr	0	And with a large pistol in his hand , aimed right at the giant 's face .
tr	0	He 'd need a swimming pool of a water and a full moon to survive a hit like that .
tr	4	But the grenade rounds contained an explosive core , similar to that of a Russian RPG rocket .
tr	2	Now that the dragon had flown away , he was going out to check on the Colonel .
tr	2	It was the dragon - flying a slow circle around the area , looking for more soldiers .
tr	2	He knew the Colonel had told him not to try and make contact , but Echo had no choice .
tr	3	With a jerk , the telepath was lifted off the ground , torso dangling from the dragon 's mouth .
tr	1	At the apex of his flight , the dragon turned and dived , tucking his wings in close .
tr	3	CHAPTER THIRTEEN It was dark now , as the trio rode along in Jimmy 's truck .
tr	3	He kept his eyes on the road , talking to the teens without turning to face them .
tr	1	" Wait a minute - you said you died in 1962 " Josie said , confused .
tr	2	It was a complicated condition and the kids didn 't need to be confused by it now .
tr	3	" Sir , I don 't think that 's w - " Campbell started to say .
tr	1	" I still don 't like being bait , " Jimmy said , crossing his arms over his chest .
tr	1	Jimmy 's truck was parked beside the gas station , with Mark and Josie patiently waiting inside it .
tr	1	" Man , I didn 't think I could hold that much longer , " Jimmy said .
tr	4	But then , his food didn 't require any more preparation then tearing it out of someone 's chest .
tr	1	Jimmy again went rigid , his eyes glazing over as a telepath took hold of his mind .
tr	4	Josie was staring at Jimmy , wondering how many of these telepathic takeovers he could take .
tr	3	" You 'll have plenty of time to talk later , k - " Franks started to say .
tr	4	Josie , meanwhile , had backed away from the shapeshifter , her back pressed against the elevator doors .
tr	4	Josie began to fumble with the elevator buttons , unable to turn her eyes away from the shapeshifter .
tr	2	Clinging to one of his legs was a teenage boy , also lightly sprayed in blood .
tr	0	Finch and Todd had received training during their stint at the Service 's Academy on paranormal threats .
tr	3	He stood there , taking the shots , until the two agents were out of ammunition .
tr	1	In seconds , the lobby was filled with confused people , turning , running around in confusion .
tr	1	Most of the rounds flattened against his skin , leaving only bruises or the most superficial of cuts .
tr	2	" And how do you propose to kill me this time , Col - " he said .
tr	0	Even with the souls of hundreds burning within him , he was no match for thousands .
tr	1	In the cold , dark confines of his sarcophagus , he was not sure what the sounds were .
tr	1	Then his neck stretched - transforming not into something new , but deforming his natural shape .
tr	4	He needed to breathe to have the energy to fight , or use up his stolen life energy .
tr	4	And the human had been correct - he was burning through all the life forces he had taken .
tr	1	And he had told her and Jimmy about it turning into a dragon and killing him .
tr	4	In the windows of the hotel , at least a half-dozen reporters began snapping pictures of the fight .
tr	3	Its wings flapped feebly , blowing gusts of wind out that blew the toppled pool furniture further away .
tr	4	His legs , now fully regenerated , were covered in just long strips of blood-stained fabric .
tr	4	By the dragon , Keen and his agents were leaning in close , watching it closely .
tr	4	She knew too well that if the shapeshifter could take this form it could only mean Jimmy was dead .
tr	0	Maybe she didn 't know just how much this Jimmy had been in love with her .
tr	1	The transformation continued , the giant 's huge body turning red , swelling , growing scales .
tr	1	It held him up , in a seated position , his legs sprawled out in front of him .
tr	1	He wondered if this was what all his countless thousands of victims had felt like as they died .
tr	1	Two more rounds hammered into the giant 's skull , shattering bone and pulping his brain .
tr	3	Now that it was over , Josie sat in shock , thinking about the past few days .
tr	0	Josie , her arm now bandaged , watched all this from the back of the ambulance .
tr	3	Its sensitive nose caught a whiff of something and it trotted quickly away , off the road .
tr	1	There , she was shown a shower and given a dark business suit and matching shoes to wear .
tr	0	Hours later , the plane had set down in Florida , at an Air Force base .
tr	4	The walls were plain white , and the hallway seemed to have far more fluorescent lights than it needed .
tr	4	She had short blonde hair , was middle aged and a little on the heavy side .
tr	4	The guards had positioned the gurney with Jimmy 's body bag next to the water 's edge .
tr	2	" Well , I could tell you ... " " But you 'd have to kill me ? "
tr	2	He was laid out on some kind of metal grating floor about a foot under the surface .
tr	0	The head was vaguely human , but instead of smooth skin had scales , like a snake .
tr	3	" But you 're right , I should eat -- I 'm off to do just that . "
tr	1	He possessed highly advanced reasoning skills but could , at best , be described as a bumbling child genius .
tr	1	William feeling his blood pressure rising caught and stopped himself from nervously tapping his foot on the rug .
tr	4	William caught and held Victoria 's eyes for a moment , desperately trying to convey his impatience .
tr	1	I assure you , we cannot invade Toby 's privacy , and we certainly cannot control him . "
tr	3	The two of you should go sit with Toby , he 's starting to talk . "
tr	2	Toby looked back and forth at both of their faces several times , finally stopping to focus on Victoria .
tr	0	Citizen input was considered an invaluable cross-check on the accuracy of the data and the reliability of the hardware .
tr	0	Alfred had started losing his blond hair at age 37 , and by 47 it was a memory .
tr	4	If he had confided everything I suspect you would have stayed with us , " said Alfred chuckling .
tr	1	It reminds him of you and I think he feels he 's working with you in there .
tr	4	In every conceivable situation , an acceptable human form would add to the unit 's effectiveness .
tr	4	I need a full report on the benefits and risks , and anything you 'd need to develop .
tr	0	" You know of everything in Asia and that was in your backyard , " said Alfred .
tr	0	" I lost a lead technologist and close friend in that attack , " said Alfred .
tr	2	I am sorry you lost Dr. Crawford , but I cannot help you with this . "
tr	2	Toby sat his cheeseburger down and took a long pull on the straw leading into his chocolate milkshake .
tr	3	That paper is really just notes and that 's not the title I would publish . "
tr	4	Toby directed these to a log , recording the information so he could later reverse engineer the logic .
tr	3	" My instructions are to drink martinis slowly until dinner hour , then switch to Scotch .
tr	2	He watched the details of William 's lab cross in front of him as 007 looked around the room .
tr	1	" I think I did , it cut off after William asked 007 why he turned around . "
tr	0	Jacob said , " Right , I pushed a command to 007 and William noticed the change .
tr	1	And engineering Toby 's birth for research , Toby is just a lab rat to Alfred ! "
tr	2	" We could blow the whistle on NET now , get back to our normal lives .
tr	2	" Good , " said Jacob smiling , " you don 't need any more money . "
tr	0	" He may , and that 's a risk , but we need William to know soon .
tr	4	I can 't have Toby meandering around NET ' s mesh network or the global network .
tr	1	" I cannot imagine , " said William , " what life must have been like for him . "
tr	1	" Here , go put this jumpsuit on and I 'll show you , " said William .
tr	1	" All the way dear , science first , " William said , zipping the suit closed .
tr	2	" Well no , but I could send your exact body measurements out for a tailor-made cat woman suit .
tr	1	Victoria did five squats , ignoring the question , raising her arms over her head each time .
tr	4	Perhaps that lifestyle , combined with the challenges of aging , possibly even senility , had jaded him .
tr	1	The ability to power and utilize these organisms directly within the human brain is a reality .
tr	3	CHAPTER TWELVE Toby jumped onto the sofa in William 's study his new black suit , stretching .
tr	3	" Yes that is correct , other than the size it 's exactly the same suit .
tr	2	Toby crossed his legs and relaxed into the sofa , smiling , content to be back to work .
tr	4	We can tell William too , but we have to make sure he cannot be hurt first . "
tr	3	William does many complicated things to test 007 , and using this account from the outside could appear normal .
tr	4	Toby absently drew imaginary lines between the planets on the Milky Way Galaxy wall with his index finger .
tr	3	I have learned that I have past history at NET , although I cannot remember it .
tr	1	" NET has several businesses , but holds the science research group as its prize possession .
tr	0	And Victoria taking care of you may have saved your life by removing you from the NET labs . "
tr	0	She was shocked that Toby knew these things and had held back so much from her .
tr	4	If you can join the network , even the sensor mesh , then everything in NET can be accessed .
tr	1	I am not a hacker , I am a research scientist , " said Jacob with wide disarming grin .
tr	3	I want to let William know you have the ability to connect into his lab and work with 007 .
tr	4	" The backbone servers have not been rebooted and there have been no power outages for 18 months .
tr	3	" Mother didn 't like consulting and her father was sad about that , " said Toby matter-of-factly .
tr	3	" We thought it would be safer to have a chat with you without others listening . "
tr	2	I 'm going to re-connect your lab to the rest of NET now -- someone has noticed .
tr	0	Although betraying nothing , Ben had begun to loath the man who was in a perpetual bad mood .
tr	1	Ron is wise , but as you know his game is politics and marketing spin , " said Alfred .
tr	4	" The project needed someone who could understand it , and I thank you , Ben .
tr	3	" Now it 's up to Ron to package it and present it to industry , " said Ben .
tr	2	" Hold off a little longer on submitting our proposal for the HS and clone technologies to legal .
tr	3	William waited outside a moment longer , watching Victoria walk down the hall from the study through the kitchen .
tr	0	" You can wait 20 seconds , " she replied , dragging him by the hand through the kitchen .
tr	2	I don 't want to be too recognizable , and Victoria sold all my best cloths . "
tr	2	William stood , not 3 feet away from his friend , whose death he had agonized over for months .
tr	4	William stepped across the space between them , still wondering if this was real , and hugged Jacob .
tr	2	" This better be good , or I 'll kill you myself , and who would know ! "
tr	3	" So apparently , only the four of us know you weren 't killed in that attack ? "
tr	3	" How about the bottle of Scotch that 's been in your cupboard for the past year ?
tr	3	William found the bottle in the top cupboard above his stove and returned with the bottle and glasses .
tr	0	William sat on the sofa and leaned back , wondering if this was a bad dream .
tr	4	Jacob perched on the edge of a recliner , hands on his knees , eyes glowing .
tr	1	I just laid low , staying with Victoria for a while , and things got stranger . "
tr	1	" I 'm all ears , " said William , draining his Scotch , then standing to pour another .
tr	4	There were people lying in the street , knocked down from the force of the blast .
tr	4	She asked to be left alone and spent the rest of the day closed up in her office .
tr	1	" I 'm just going to tell you straight up , buddy , " said Jacob , facing William .
tr	3	I think he wants to sell the HS units , the bio organism growing methods , Toby , everything .
tr	3	Knowing Jacob , William had little doubt that he would be feeling better within the hour .
tr	4	The first day he figured out how to use the connections he started a search for you and NET .
tr	2	" World domination , for the good guys , " said Victoria , juggling her eyebrows .
tr	1	" The goal is seamless operation of multiple remote HS units by a human host , " said Jacob .
tr	1	Noticing Victoria looking away in thought , William wondered if perhaps she didn 't agree with this .
tr	0	" Alfred has already asked you and Ben to research transplanting an operational organism between hosts . "
tr	1	Young Toby 's life was changing rapidly , and he was dealing with situations in a deceptively hostile environment .
tr	2	" Oh , tell Toby I said hello , " William said quietly , looking around the parking lot .
tr	4	He looked around for the sensors connected to the mesh , wondering if Alfred was watching .
tr	1	William waved and shook his head in mock disapproval , continuing straight through the bright lobby toward his lab .
tr	1	" It 's amazing you picked this up ; it 's a highly optimized system , " said Jacob .
tr	3	It took some time earlier to absorb and integrate the additional data with the control systems .
tr	1	" William 's car will be in the NET parking lot in about 2 minutes , " declared Toby .
tr	4	" Sure , I can direct one CPU to feed audio and video feeds to you . "
tr	4	You 're sweet , 007 , but you never leave the building , " Jenny said .
tr	1	He was down by Dr. Cunningham 's lab , " said Jenny , leaning forward and lowering her voice .
tr	0	I am shocked and appalled , " said 007 in mock horror , making Jenny laugh .
tr	2	It 's going to rain in 5 minutes ; you may want to close your car windows . "
tr	2	" Oh , you 're right , " said Jenny , " I did leave a window down today .
tr	3	Yes , well , if someone stops by just ask them to wait for a minute until I return .
tr	1	" Hello 007 , and friends , " said William , joining the party from his lab .
tr	1	He waved his finger in front of the display to draw their attention , remaining silent .
tr	4	Jenny rounded the corner a moment later , slowing to a walk for the remaining 30 feet .
tr	0	I 've always wanted to participate in a humorous exchange like this , " said 007 .
tr	0	I understand , " said Ben , " I 'll stop by later for a talk . "
tr	1	The display lit up , showing Toby , with the backdrop of the recliner , grinning broadly .
tr	0	" It 's a playground for hackers , " said Toby , spreading his hands and shaking his head .
tr	3	" That 's what it 's designed to allow , at least for a host , " said Ben .
tr	2	" Maybe for you , but not for the rest of us , " said Victoria .
tr	3	" That was the theory , " said William , " but we never tested it . "
tr	3	After that , it 's training that makes the difference ... Take care of that mother of yours .
tr	1	" It also helps us monitor his vitals , location , etc. , " said William .
tr	1	" I think since the bombing last year , his health has gone downhill rapidly , " said Victoria .
tr	4	" He 'll never have my fashion sense , smooth lines or moves with the ladies . "
tr	3	" Don 't worry , doctor , I 'll treat this facility as if it were my own .
tr	0	She was wearing purple short shorts , a matching tank top , and her favorite purple sandals .
tr	4	" I have an extra challenge this time , and it 's worth more money . "
tr	3	" You know , I feel a little strange sitting in a room alone , talking to myself . "
tr	4	It 's pretty low-level code , the same logic that keeps him from falling out of the chair .
tr	1	He could melt into most social situations , typically initiating intriguing conversation with anyone encountered -- particularly women .
tr	1	" I don 't need to see this , " said Victoria , making a sour face .
tr	4	Then he pulled on the black Tuxedo pants over the suit and slid into the white collared dress shirt .
tr	4	Victoria snapped the bowtie in place , fussed with it , then held the jacket up for him .
tr	0	After waiting a full minute for good measure , he began the old familiar walk toward William 's lab .
tr	1	006 mimicked Toby 's actions , examining Toby and himself as if inspecting his new suit in a mirror .
tr	1	Turning quickly in surprise , Alfred stared at Victoria and Toby , who had unexpectedly arrived behind him .
tr	2	Toby led Ahmad and Bob through the lobby to the elevator , followed by Tom and Jerry .
tr	4	Alfred held Victoria by the arm , letting the group pass and get ahead of them .
tr	0	" Our deal was for a large sum of money , and you haven 't paid yet . "
tr	1	William has assured me the technology is sound , so it 's the money , right ?
tr	3	Toby was trying desperately to hide his anxiety , which had to be apparent to those monitoring his suit .
tr	4	Bring 007 and William to the lower level and we 'll show our guests what we do here . "
tr	2	Victoria was shaken , expecting the two goons to shoot her or drag her away from Toby .
tr	0	" They will await me in the car , " said Ahmad , walking into the open elevator .
tr	2	" I know Ahmad , " said Victoria , dashing into the room out of breath .
tr	4	Getting on an elevator is a huge risk ; those two guys with Alfred are expendable . "
tr	1	" Or maybe they 're holding all the bargaining chips right now , " said Toby .
tr	0	Jacob was certain that casual acquaintances would not be able to tell them apart , even up close .
tr	2	Jacob tore himself away from the wonder of Toby 's networked world and got them back on track .
tr	0	The automatic tracking software had Toby in focus , walking quickly away from the building and looking confused .
tr	3	He watched in horror as Toby stumbled directly toward the two Asians who were standing by their rental car .
tr	0	Toby directed 006 to fight with the rear door handle , which he was hoping to find locked .
tr	1	" Okay , both the transponder and an external net connection are up and healthy . "
tr	0	Alfred shuffled out the door , thinking perhaps this was just a game of cat and mouse .
tr	2	" Alfred is in the elevator now , door open on the first floor , " said 007 .
tr	4	Alfred walked off the elevator , hesitated , and turned to look back at the open door .
tr	2	" I invested 20 million dollars to recruit Jacob Crawford to lead our combined technology teams .
tr	2	" Your friendship clouded your judgment , and you shared too many details with Dr. Crawford .
tr	2	You have no other friends or family , and you 're too greedy to pass this payday .
tr	3	" The security monitors are reporting that Alfred is having a heart attack , " said Toby .
tr	2	" Toby , " said Jacob , " what 's going on with 006 right now ? "
tr	4	I 'll be in the rear lab storage room -- I want to use the computers back there .
tr	2	Mohammed was face down on the floor , a small streak of blood seeping from beneath him .
tr	1	A patient , this time an old friend , was slipping away , and nothing could be done .
tr	1	It 's on its own mesh net and I have full access , including all the on-board security systems .
tr	0	" Yes , to both , " said 007 , backing away a bit and looking doubtfully at Toby .
tr	0	" Making haste , " said 007 , turning the limo sharply away from the curb and flooring it .
tr	1	How could such an incredible human being allow this to happen , actually engineer such a thing ?
tr	0	Toby looked across at 006 , still his twin , smiling back at him and appearing completely at ease .
tr	0	" Not a problem at all ... I must say , extracting 006 certainly was a simple operation . "
tr	3	" Put this on ... " " He 's not a complete dolt , " said 007 , laughing .
tr	1	" I watched the security videos from the hotel bombing in Jakarta , " said William .
tr	1	She was unnerved by the swiftness of his actions and the control her father was displaying .
tr	4	I didn 't believe you were dead , Jacob , but after several weeks it didn 't matter .
tr	0	Tell me , Dr. Crawford , what was your strategy in playing dead all these months ? "
tr	3	" It was not his plan to kill the two of you , it was mine . "
tr	0	" You 're out of time , Ahmad , " said Ben taking another stride forward .
tr	0	" And apparently you need a reminder of the bomb Mohammed planted , " said Ahmad .
tr	1	He watched , first person , as 006 moved forward , approaching the narrow security scanner hall .
tr	0	A two-inch glass wall dropped from the ceiling on both ends of the scanner security hall , trapping Ahmad .
tr	0	" We could have called in a bomb squad to defuse it , " said Victoria .
tr	1	" I 'd still be in a lab someplace if it wasn 't for you guys . "
tr	0	The year following his reported death in Jakarta , Dr. Jacob Crawford was a busy man .
tr	3	His concern now was that that plan would somehow get botched by Alfred , the government or both parties .
tr	0	Ben and William both held lead roles in Jacob 's new organization , Crawford Research Partners .
tr	3	That first night they stayed in a traditional Irish hotel and ate a simple meat stew .
tr	2	" No , bacon and ham both come from a pig but bacon is not ham . "
tr	3	But this is as close to bacon as you get for the next ten days , okay ? "
tr	3	" But I have to admit to not knowing who has the right of way , here . "
tr	0	Sarah dug into her purse and handed her son a biscuit wrapped in a paper napkin .
tr	1	" We 'll stop for lunch in a bit , " David said to his son .
tr	4	Please let it have indoor plumbing , Sarah thought as she climbed out of the car .
tr	4	She put her head on his shoulder and felt some of the tension drain from her body .
tr	3	That night would be the last time that Sarah could look up to the heavens without praying fervently .
tr	0	Sarah turned over in bed and put her hand out to touch her husband 's shoulder .
tr	4	Stunned by the images and sirens and screams , David held up a hand for silence .
tr	1	" It 's going to be okay , " she said into his baby fine hair .
tr	2	" I 'm scared , Dad , " John said , prompting David to hold him even tighter .
tr	4	If there 's really been some kind of nuclear explosion -- " " Are you serious ? "
tr	2	" I 'm too rusty to be jumping on some horse I don 't know . "
tr	4	" They might be gentle on the ground but hell on wheels once you 're in the saddle . "
tr	1	" Sure , why would you be walking and you with three big horses just standing around ? "
tr	1	If I don 't hear from him in another few weeks , I 'll start to worry . "
tr	1	" I 'd like it all the same , " David said , reaching for his wallet .
tr	3	When you don 't get fresh fruit and stuff your bones start to go bad . "
tr	1	Stung by his visual assault , she turned to get David 's attention as the man passed .
tr	4	It 's hard to explain but the results of it are what we 're experiencing now . "
tr	3	" If it is this electromagnetic thing , how long until things get back to normal ? "
tr	1	" Just wondering , " he said , rubbing her arm and looking out into the black Irish night .
tr	4	When they awoke the next morning , Sarah made cheese sandwiches and mugs of tea for breakfast .
tr	4	" It 's like a big rope or leash , " she said , buckling the halter .
tr	4	Unlike the hurried mornings of life back in the States , the days now began slowly and intimately .
tr	0	Her husband was wiry and angular , solid and secure against the uncertainty of the coming day .
tr	3	This was about the time each morning when worry about her parents crept into her thoughts .
tr	4	" Let 's go back into town and see if there isn 't more news , " David said .
tr	1	" Now , remember , John , " Sarah said , standing next to John and the chestnut pony .
tr	4	She took a deep breath , felt the horse move beneath her , and then exhaled .
tr	2	" If we don 't go now we 'll have to put it off until tomorrow . "
tr	0	" And I 'll have made sandwiches from the bread I was going to make today . "
tr	4	The sun came out from behind wispy grey clouds to warm their backs as they rode .
tr	3	And wasn 't it Mack Finn , himself , who had put the old tosser there ?
tr	2	David asked for no advice and somehow he wasn 't being thrown to the ground or run off with .
tr	3	She watched John turn his pony off the road into the bordering field to explore it at a trot .
tr	4	The woman wore a long woolen skirt and looked like she 'd stepped out of the last century .
tr	2	" Well , you 'll learn , my dear , " the older woman said kindly .
tr	3	" Sit , sit , " she said , motioning to the dinette chairs tucked under the table .
tr	0	The boy -- his name was Billy -- was a teenager and clearly scared out of his mind .
tr	3	Without looking away , Finn deftly wrung the puppy 's neck and tossed it back to the gypsy .
tr	3	She was too tired tonight to figure out how that could be but was grateful for her new friend .
tr	0	When they got to the house , David pulled John out of the saddle and handed him to Sarah .
tr	3	The lock on the front door was broken and the interior of the cottage was messy but not trashed .
tr	1	This ... this crisis is not going to bring out the best in people , David . "
tr	2	" Mom , Dad says the goats have to live with the horses from now on .
tr	1	" If you wait a minute , I 'll make you a fried egg , " she said .
tr	1	" He needs milk , David , " Sarah said , the panic still with her .
tr	4	You could wing it to a certain extent when you cooked , but baking needed exactness .
tr	0	Was it so much to ask that she give her child a slice of damn bread ?
tr	2	It took every ounce of emotional strength she had not to physically or verbally launch into David .
tr	4	He twisted around to show her the tag in the ewe 's ear that he was leading .
tr	0	" That is a good question with an unknowable answer , " Sarah said , trying not to smile .
tr	4	" Why would He make ' em so cute if He wanted us to kill ' em ? "
tr	4	" Okay , Mom , she 's about to be murdered in the basement , right ? "
tr	0	Sarah cleared her throat , gave her son a baleful look , and began to read .
tr	3	But likely it was the additional news she brought that contributed to the lines of worry on her face .
tr	1	The villains broke into his house , murdered poor Iain , and ransacked his croft . "
tr	4	Afraid that his insecurity might be the result of her nerves , she smiled and shook her head .
tr	0	" Okay , " she said , putting the gun back down and taking a long breath .
tr	4	She needed more soap -- for the dishes , for their clothes , for their baths .
tr	0	That night , David came home exhausted with a bandaged hand , bringing soap and a bag of flour .
tr	2	The people who own the cottage left a storage cellar of food , mostly for the horses .
tr	4	The nights are still and you can see every star in the firmament one by one .
tr	0	She thanked God for it and realized , again , that this too was an answer to prayer .
tr	1	" Yeah , I 'll go with him , " he said , shivering in anticipation of the cold .
tr	3	" With this , it was more trouble than it was worth to get up on the horse .
tr	4	CHAPTER NINE " Why , exactly , do you have to spend the night out there ? "
tr	4	If the sheep didn 't wake him , Rocky surely would if someone or something was creeping about .
tr	3	She took anti-anxiety medication to help her control what she insisted was a rational but constant fear .
tr	4	It was only three weeks but he now had callouses he never imagined owning back then .
tr	4	He gave the gun a glance as David mounted with it , cracked open over his arm .
tr	0	Back at the cottage , a hot breakfast of scrambled eggs , biscuits and tea awaited him .
tr	1	It was raining again , turning the thin layer of snow on the ground to slush .
tr	0	Sarah tried to remember the last time she had heard that happy childish tone come out of his mouth .
tr	2	Finn found himself chuckling and his brother looked up from his cards with a worried look on his face .
tr	2	Sarah and David had exchanged a look when John had suggested it but didn 't discourage him .
tr	1	" John ... " Grinning , he hopped up and went to the kitchen sink to wash .
tr	2	Sarah took the biscuits out of the oven and slid one onto a small plate for him .
tr	3	It surprised him a little to realize that , lately , he 'd done quite a lot of praying .
tr	3	The thought surprised him but as it took hold , it gave him strength and purpose .
tr	3	She sat down with a hard thump in the snow beside the now still bag and burst into tears .
tr	4	And if they 'd broken into the gate to steal a cow , why were they all there ?
tr	2	Sarah pulled the roast chicken out of the oven and set it on top of the cook stove .
tr	0	She had enough potatoes and garlic and wild rosemary to make a proper feast of the dish .
tr	0	Out in the courtyard , she watched John as he put his dogs through their paces .
tr	3	She looked at her beautiful golden brown roast , shiny with herbs and basted with goat butter .
tr	0	" Well , you can read a book at the same time , " she said with a grin .
tr	3	All at once , both dogs stopped playing with the rag they had been tugging on .
tr	2	Sarah dropped the biscuits and bolted for the front door and the source of the noise .
tr	4	" Give us the horses and we 'll let you be , " the man behind him said .
tr	2	" Oh , so you 'll be needing to reload to dispatch the lot , eh ? "
tr	2	" And the one you wounded will probably die anyway so he 's a good second choice . "
tr	1	She saw the shovel smash into the man 's head and then drop uselessly from John 's grip .
tr	4	He would kill her and the lad before breakfast and torch their miserable hut with their bodies inside !
tr	2	" I know you loved my brother , " he said , forcing his voice to sound calm .
tr	2	" Kind of a risk they don 't feel good about taking , you know ? "
tr	2	" Sounds like you 've talked yourself into going to look for him , " she said .
tr	3	" What more has to happen to convince you that it is not safe here ? "
tr	1	If she saw activity in his front yard -- dogs barking , or whatever -- should she stop ?
tr	0	Now I know ... " He raised his arm again and surveyed the crowd that was approaching the wagon .
tr	2	A man called up to him : " Do you have housing for us , then , Mick ? "
tr	2	" And go to the towns that have food and work and laws still working . "
tr	1	Pretty soon , the tapes would start as soon as she swung up into the saddle .
tr	3	She took in a big breath and let it out slowly as she watched the sky .
tr	3	Sarah couldn 't put her finger on why , but there was something about this girl that unsettled her .
tr	3	Directly in front of her , the small cottage sat in front of a truncated drive .
tr	1	She stopped in front of the cottage and scanned the windows for any sign of life .
tr	0	Sarah stood motionless in the doorway and watched him , the gun in her hand but by her side .
tr	4	The man frowned , his eyes catching the glint of the Glock at the end of her arm .
tr	0	The older man spoke again and Sarah felt the hand that held the gun relax a bit .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , again , I 'm sorry for ... " Sarah indicated the porch .
tr	2	" Go back and find something to wrap poor Devon in , " he said to his son .
tr	1	As bumpy and uneven as it had been up to now , it felt now that Dan was limping .
tr	0	With shaking hands , she ran her fingers down his hock and lifted his front left hoof .
tr	2	It 's hard to describe to you but the milk would open up new worlds of food for us .
tr	2	Tomorrow , she and John would step off the garden boundaries in anticipation of preparing the ground .
tr	3	She brought his tea to him and set it down on the table next to the bed .
tr	2	" Mom , I 'm good , " he said , moving Star out into the rain .
tr	0	The road had turned to slick mud and Sarah forbade John to even break into a trot .
tr	1	She would need to hurry if she didn 't want to spend half the morning calming his anger .
tr	1	Julie watched his gaze return to the invisible spot on the ceiling , his smile slowly fading .
tr	0	She put a shaky hand up to her face and saw John wince as she did so .
tr	1	" It 's kind of night , " John said , standing up and absently patting his pony .
tr	4	She could feel the crack in it and wondered if wearing it broken would be any help at all .
tr	4	" You mean , like maybe He wants us to leave it to Him , after all ? "
tr	3	It 's so cold that , mostly , John and I stay indoors even in the daytime .
tr	2	If Dan doesn 't snap out of his injury soon , we 'll walk to town .
tr	1	It wasn 't very jolly and I had nothing but promises to give him for a gift .
tr	2	( Although I did give him a coupon good for one free week of no stall mucking ! )
tr	4	... she had tried to help him relieve himself in a pail by the side of the bed .
tr	4	At least in the city there might be facilities or laws or provisions for the refugees .
tr	2	The light was strong enough now for him to take inventory of the room and of himself .
tr	0	" Ah , sure , don 't be mad at us , now , " The woman said .
tr	3	" Plenty of time for that and too late to get started today , so it is .
tr	4	Just the feeling of welcoming someone to their hearth on such a special night reminded her of Christmases past .
tr	2	As if I 'd know snow clouds from any other kind , she thought to herself .
tr	4	Having her stay with them would make everything so much easier -- for all of them .
tr	0	" I like to , " Sarah said , handing the woman a mug of tea .
tr	2	Do you think that stupid get my daughter married was going to go looking for your horse ?
tr	0	She sat and watched as a single tear escaped his eye and found its way down his face .
tr	0	Over his shoulder through the plastic of the barn window , she watched the snow fall .
tr	2	Out the window , he saw a crowd of people and horses in the front yard .
tr	3	He pulled against the chain that was attached to the boat anchor until he was sitting up .
tr	0	Sometimes when she thought he was in a mood , he was just lining things up in his head .
tr	3	You 'll not be changing it just because you don 't want it troubling him . "
tr	0	Sarah watched how quickly the older woman had buckled and arranged chains along the pony 's neck and back .
tr	1	If you didn 't know it was here , Sarah found herself thinking , you might never find it .
tr	3	Finn always marveled that the boy could take two steps without falling or crashing into something .
tr	0	" Ahhh , shite , an American , " he said , putting the book down .
tr	2	The words felt absurd coming out of her mouth but she forced a smile to accompany them .
tr	4	" Can you get yourself up while I look for a few things in the kitchen ?
tr	3	A part of her wanted to grab him and physically propel him down the steps to the cart .
tr	1	Chatting and smiling and gently nudging , Sarah got him off the porch and into the cart .
tr	0	She was already out of the cart and back up the porch steps , not waiting for an answer .
tr	1	Sarah felt herself slide in and out of consciousness as she listened to the harsh voices .
tr	0	The man with his hand on her raised his fist and held it to her face .
tr	3	Sarah directed her attention back to Seamus who was sitting quietly as if engaged in his own thoughts .
tr	1	" Just kill ' im , " the lout said , as he moved back to his horse .
tr	0	Later that day , Sarah watched John 's eyes go from hers to the window and back to hers .
tr	0	She glanced at John and her heart hardened at the thought of someone trying to hurt him .
tr	1	It was midmorning and the sky had darkened and let loose with a gentle , insistent rain .
tr	3	She resisted the temptation to just pull the gun out and ride down the street demanding information .
tr	3	Donovan stopped stacking and stared with his mouth open at the sight of Sarah riding down the main street .
tr	4	A skinny redheaded gypsy boy with badly crossed eyes took a step off the wooden walkway into the street .
tr	0	Donovan looked back at Sarah who had Dan 's reins in her hands now and was checking his girth .
tr	0	The ride would end with her arms around her child , holding him safely and snugly to her heart .
tr	3	Time enough later -- much , much later -- to talk to him about his Dad .
tr	1	Praying for guidance , for relief from pain , for hope that her boy was alive .
tr	0	Donovan had wasted no time in clearing away the dead animal carcasses and bringing some order to the devastation .
tr	0	She watched him hungrily as he walked the camp , staying mostly with Donovan and Gavin .
tr	0	Sarah glimpsed over the woman 's shoulder at John who was eating and laughing with Gavin .
tr	1	" Fi 's just giving you a hard time , " Donovan said , frowning at his sister .
tr	3	We 'll watch each other 's backs and plant food and rebuild our little patch of the country .
tr	1	I don 't know how you do things in Ireland , but we are not finished here .
tr	2	Sarah looked at the motley group of men and women standing in the forecourt of her holiday cottage .
tr	2	" And knowing it helps us to know how long we 'll likely need to live like this . "
tr	2	" There was a nuclear bomb dropped by some still unidentified terrorist group over London four months back .
tr	3	" It appears it was targeted but the bomb went off course and detonated over the Atlantic . "
tr	2	Donovan turned to him and the effort it took to smile seemed to weigh him down .
tr	1	" The point of how this new information affects all of us here is this , " he said .
tr	0	He would walk away from the dog but when he turned around , he was always right behind him .
tr	4	" People like Mr. Donovan don 't care about why something happened , only that it happened .
tr	3	Like a lot of parents , she had worried about so many unimportant things in the past .
tr	4	So badly did she want to believe it , her heart literally ached in her chest .
tr	1	With Mike at the helm , it would definitely be a well-organized and judiciously run community .
tr	1	" You scared the life out of me , " Sarah said , turning to him with a grin .
tr	3	" She told me a little bit more about the community y ' all are starting .
tr	1	" And I would like that , " she said , looking directly into his eyes .
tr	1	" I swear I didn 't know I was going to do that until I was doing it .
tr	3	" Best idea yet is to just forget it , if you can do that . "
tr	1	Finn had spent nearly the full day in it , rocking , sipping tea and smoking .
tr	3	" Brendan wants to know should we raid the kitchen or eat what we got in town .
tr	1	Finn asked , leaning forward in his chair to see if he could spot him from the porch .
tr	2	The kind of something that came from money and having it all done for you your whole life .
tr	3	That night at the evening meal , the group at Cairn Cottage sat around the open fire .
tr	3	So far , the extent of their contact with Sarah was to smile shyly at her .
tr	3	" But you think by defying them or calling attention to yourselves you 'll make it worse ? "
tr	3	" Don 't tell me about being strong or resilient or crap like that , I warn you .
tr	2	It 's good , " Donovan said , sounding not at all like any of it was good .
tr	1	" You mean you 'll not be insisting on waiting for them brigands to descend upon us ? "
tr	0	If each of us had a Gatling gun and automatic weapons too it wouldn 't be enough . "
tr	3	" Oh , don 't say that when you know it 's the last thing you 'll do . "
tr	2	Sparks from the outdoor fire shot into the air almost as if conjured up by him and his words .
tr	3	" I don 't want her touched so be mindful of that , " he said .
tr	1	Sarah hadn 't been sure if that mattered and Donovan didn 't seem to have an opinion on it .
tr	1	His arm , mended but not strong , hung at an unnatural angle to his body as he ran .
tr	4	It didn 't make sense that Sarah would actually be with them but Finn seemed convinced she would be .
tr	0	She would worry about morals and why and all that once she had David back with her .
tr	1	Was she asking this woman to risk her husband so that Sarah could retrieve her own ?
tr	0	Brendan said , giving the lead rope attached to David 's hands a hard yank to test its security .
tr	2	" You don 't have to do everything that sociopath tells you to do , Brendan . "
tr	3	He desperately wanted his Dad back but the odds of losing his Mother too just went up significantly .
tr	2	" You 're not taking this theory about being sneaky from some television show , are you ? "
tr	4	His eyes opened and the peace she thought she saw in his face when they were closed vanished .
tr	1	She knew he was in pain and they had nothing , not even an aspirin , for it .
tr	1	Walk right into the midst of all of ' em yelling and running and shooting , ya see ? "
tr	2	Be ready to shoot anybody who looks at you , let alone tries to stop you .
tr	0	" But I ... " " I know what you want , Sarah , " Donovan said tiredly .
tr	3	" The rest of ' em won 't fight on without the head of the snake .
tr	0	Gypsies aren 't really a warring -- " " Okay , thanks , Mike , " Sarah said .
tr	4	He had already sent another dozen down the road to meet the American and her party .
tr	2	His gaze sought out the young boy , Conor , who had brought him the information the night before .
tr	3	The posting action of rising up and down actually helped dissipate the anxious energy that was coursing through her .
tr	0	All of a sudden , it struck Sarah how foolish it was what they were doing .
tr	1	He had seen no traffic of any kind on the road , not horses , not pedestrians .
tr	2	" Because I know the Yanks 'll come for your lot sooner or later , " Brendan said .
tr	3	Brendan gave David the directions back to his cottage , but the cottage was not where David was going .
tr	0	Her stomach lurched and she turned and was sick on the man who held her the tightest .
tr	3	Suddenly , he pulled out the pistol from the waistband at the small of his back .
tr	1	" Oh , Jesus , Mack , I can find him , I will find him .
tr	0	Sarah felt rough hands grabbing her jacket , her hair and pulling her back to a standing position .
tr	2	One of the gypsies took a piece of cord and tied John 's hands in front of him .
tr	2	" Hide it someplace so you can get to it easier than your sock , okay ? "
tr	3	John stood up and went to the window and pulled back the curtain to peer out .
tr	1	" John , you first , " David said quietly , pushing the boy toward the window .
tr	0	Sarah screamed and grabbed for David as he sank , with a groan , to his knees .
tr	2	The same man who had hit David set his gun aside and held David from behind .
tr	2	Blood gushed out of her mouth and she collapsed to a sitting position on the bed .
tr	0	The anguish in John 's voice brought Sarah out of the daze of pain that clouded her head .
tr	2	The man nodded vigorously and quickly untied David who put his hands to his bleeding chest .
tr	4	John sat on the bed where his father was lying and held a folded up sheet to his wound .
tr	2	" You are going to tell anyone outside that door to back off , " she said to him .
tr	4	" The people they stole that food from are long gone , " he told her .
tr	1	When Donovan came charging into the gypsy camp , he had no way of knowing that Finn was dead .
tr	0	Donovan and his group had settled into three farms within a mile of where Sarah and David now lived .
tr	2	Together they talked about their men , food preparation , and how the world looked to them now .
tr	4	The reunion , once all elements of danger had been removed , had been lengthy and exquisite .
tr	2	In fact , if your chores are done , it 's probably time to wash up .
tr	2	Sarah lit candles and kept the cook stove door open so the heat would fill the little dining room .
tr	4	" God , you two developed a secret language since I was gone , " David said .
tr	2	" Or I 'll tell ' em and I 'm not as good a teller as you . "
tr	4	He brought a couple of these back and when they were charged up , they worked fine . "
tr	1	" Cheers , " Sarah said in a whisper , but didn 't touch her glass .
tr	0	I 'm beyond hopeful and anxious to see you and Dad again after all this time .
tr	1	His unruly golden hair , cut square at his shoulders , was confined by a band of crimson satin .
tr	0	A narrow ridge formed a natural ramp that led up the steep face of the crag .
tr	1	" Haven 't I made my admiration for you plain ever since I first saw you ? "
tr	3	That officer 's sister followed you ; faster than you thought , I don 't doubt .
tr	0	The pay was poor and the wine was sour , and I don 't like black men .
tr	2	" Do you think I 've followed you this far , to turn around and ride off empty-handed ?
tr	4	They had emerged from the belt of leaves , and stared down into the lower reaches of the forest .
tr	2	" Something 's eating our horses , but it 's not a lion -- Crom ! "
tr	4	" Can 't we get into the trees and get away , traveling like apes through the branches ? "
tr	4	Besides , I have an idea that devil could tear up any tree around here by its roots . "
tr	4	" If we ate that we wouldn 't need the bite of a dragon , " she grunted .
tr	4	She stood a long moment in silence , posed like a bronze statue on the rock .
tr	2	I see no herds on the plain , no signs of cultivation , or people moving about . "
tr	3	The great brute squatted below , watching the crag with the frightful patience of the reptile folk .
tr	2	" I don 't know whether it will do the job or not , " quoth she .
tr	1	The scales along her back and flanks turned from rusty brown to a dull lurid red .
tr	0	Again and again her mighty head crashed upward through the branches , snapping vainly on empty air .
tr	1	A noisy gurgling and lapping beyond the dense thicket indicated that the dragon was drinking at the pool .
tr	0	The city looked very far away across the plain , farther than it had looked from the crag .
tr	4	He glanced fearfully back toward the black line that indicated the forest some six miles away .
tr	4	I snatch naps like a panther watching beside the trail for a deer to come by .
tr	1	Valerian saw the ancient irrigation ditches she indicated , half filled in places , and overgrown with cactus .
tr	0	He was on his feet with his sword in his hand before he realized what had disturbed him .
tr	0	Her long black hair hung in lank strands about her shoulders , giving her a wild appearance .
tr	4	Shivering slightly , he crouched down closer behind the balustrade , intently scanning the shadows under the overhanging gallery .
tr	2	The woman stood motionless , an embodiment of paralyzed horror , staring fixedly at the apparition .
tr	0	She had his wrist again and was pulling his toward the door through which she had first come .
tr	4	she begged , reaching for his hand , and then recoiling as she remembered his warning .
tr	4	Sweat beaded the forehead of the woman facing him , and her eyes were like burning coals .
tr	3	I 'm willing to bet it wasn 't they who built this city , though . "
tr	3	" Why don 't we get out of this infernal palace , and take to the streets ? "
tr	3	Softly as phantoms they descended the stair and came to the mouth of a corridor black as night .
tr	3	" It was something that crawled , and it was as cold as ice to the touch .
tr	2	What it is , we do not know , but we have found our people hideously slain by it .
tr	3	But the wizards wove a spell that kept them in the forest and they came not into the plain .
tr	4	" For fifty years on one has left it except those -- " Again she checked herself .
tr	3	If you wander forth into the plain by night , you will certainly fall prey to the dragons . "
tr	2	" With bows and poisoned arrows thirty women could slay all the dragons in the forest . "
tr	0	The hallway was not so broad as most they had traversed , but it was long .
tr	0	Then it was that he saw , not a gargantuan blossom , but a dark-skinned man standing above her .
tr	4	These people were neither sane nor normal ; he began to doubt if they were even human .
tr	4	His teeth were sunk into his lower lip and a trickle of blood began as the punishment continued .
tr	1	Valerian cut the cords from his wrists and ankles , and pulled his to his feet .
tr	3	Valerian advanced to the door and looked down a flight of stone steps that vanished quickly into utter blackness .
tr	2	Valerian hurried back down the corridor , not stopping to close the door that opened on the stair .
tr	3	They had no breath left to shout , but a bestial mad howling rose from their lips .
tr	0	The wound in her thigh had started bleeding afresh , and she had another gash across her ribs .
tr	0	" I will go , " volunteered a warrior , who was knotting a bandage about a slashed forearm .
tr	4	She turned aside from her direct course and descended a winding staircase to the floor below .
tr	3	She recognized it for what it was -- a human being trying to cry out through a stifling gag .
tr	2	It was obvious that eventually the ball would crush her to a pulp , slowly and inexorably .
tr	0	" Once I saw it , as I crouched in a crypt among the bones of a dead king .
tr	4	She did not see a man 's dark face peer cautiously after her from behind a hanging .
tr	0	Recently he had learned to fear a woman ; now he knew what it was to fear a man .
tr	0	Olmec came toward the seated princess with a swaying , undulating walk that was mockery in itself .
tr	1	His voice had sunk to a murmur like the rippling of a stream running through starlit darkness .
tr	3	But with a lithe twist of his torso , Olmec avoided the blow and caught the pirate 's wrist .
tr	0	I swear that when we have slain the warlock , you and Valerian shall go free without harm .
tr	3	I don 't trust you any farther than I can throw a bull by the tail . "
tr	4	The jaws of an iron trap had closed on her leg , with teeth that sank deep and held .
tr	3	What mad travesty of life did you live , in the stark blackness of that eternal night ?
tr	4	She realized that grimmer game confronted her than the people who had died screaming and fleeing .
tr	4	Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons , living or dead , is entirely coincidental .
tr	1	Beside him , his head buried in a scratch ticket , was his faithful crewman Perry Winslow .
tr	0	He was just about to give his opinion of that tramp Angelina when his radio crackled .
tr	4	Further up the road was the town green , its centerpiece the tallest and oldest pine on the island .
tr	1	Curious , Lucas turned as well , understanding only then why the road had sounded funny .
tr	3	Though gray clouds still hung low in the sky , Chris noted they were moving quickly to the east .
tr	3	Though mostly buried , the part that was visible was about fifty feet long from end-to-end .
tr	4	He didn 't know how much time passed before the dog 's yelps brought him from his reverie .
tr	3	And though this sort of thing was not exactly unheard of , it was very unusual indeed .
tr	4	The two approached the wreck , walking between the beams and stepping onto the hard sand inside .
tr	4	Cobb stood there a moment taking it all in before bending over to examine one of the ribs .
tr	0	Pausing a moment , he glanced toward the ship and saw Chris had remained on board .
tr	0	Just last year , a rusty old Confederate battleship washed ashore during a hurricane in Alabama .
tr	0	It wasn 't the first time a land bridge to part of the Cape had collapsed or eroded away .
tr	2	Smiling , he glanced toward Lucas and added , " Business should boom for a while . "
tr	2	They 'll take samples of wood to see how old it is and what it 's made of .
tr	0	Lucas looked up to the sky and figured there was another hour and a half of daylight left .
tr	2	The four-story building housed his forty-seven foot cabin cruiser , the Pamela , with room for two more .
tr	4	When he arrived home that afternoon , Chris saw his mother had already summoned extra help .
tr	0	It simply wasn 't viable and usually ended up being a stopgap measure that eventually failed anyway .
tr	1	After narrowing it down , he ended up buying two thick books : Tragic Shipwrecks of New England !
tr	1	Still spry and sharp in his mid-eighties , he kept a studio over a gallery downtown .
tr	1	He listened intently and asked probing questions , laughing knowingly when Chris told him about the CNN interview .
tr	4	When Chris was finished , Dale asked if he wanted to see what he was working on .
tr	4	Chris thought long and hard , but didn 't even venture a guess , merely shook his head .
tr	3	Chris still wasn 't sure what it all meant , but fortunately , Cobb wasn 't done yet .
tr	3	" They didn 't keep THAT on board for its eggs , my boy , because that is rabbit .
tr	4	~ Over time , Chris noticed the park ranger spending lots of time at the wreck .
tr	1	... Tonight ... Midnight ... Don ' worry , you 'll get paid ... " Anger burned inside Chris .
tr	3	But when he held it to the light , he saw the bottom half was still blacker than night .
tr	4	This time , when he shook it gently to drain more sludge , something fell into his open fingertips .
tr	3	He noticed then that the last rinsing had left two other objects stuck to the bottom of the glass .
tr	0	Frustrated and disappointed about having to wait , he picked up the glass and dropped the coin back in .
tr	3	Using his other hand to shield the flame , he brought it in contact with the master fuse .
tr	4	Still , he couldn 't escape the sense that the glow had come from behind him .
tr	3	Chris watched the shouting man run down the dune and across the beach , toward the departing boats .
tr	0	Chris thought that even they must realize by now that among those dangers was a crazed and naked man .
tr	1	He said , " Existing management is worth its weight in ... " Something or other .
tr	2	" No need to remind you I 've offered you close to a billion dollars for it .
tr	4	Now , I know these things take time , so here 's what I 'm gon na do .
tr	3	As the minister went on about the economy , Chris began to think about it too .
tr	0	And though most of that had already dried up , summer was just around the corner .
tr	2	As he 'd imagined , most of the formwork had been torn away and thrown off to the side .
tr	4	He contemplated raising it over his head to use as a club as the voice spoke again .
tr	3	The man went quiet after that , apparently content to sit there and pet his dog all night long .
tr	0	Through the darkness , he heard the man 's knees crack as he slowly got up from his crouch .
tr	0	" You just can 't walk around naked is all , " was the best he could do .
tr	1	Moments later , Chris heard soft whistling , followed by someone singing in a not unpleasant tenor .
tr	3	They looked awkward in their ill-fitting suits that Chris guessed probably got worn once or twice a year .
tr	3	Their flowery hats rose about a foot into the air , draped with silk to match their dresses .
tr	1	Leaning against the church , he took a sip of orange juice and then began ravenously downing his pastry .
tr	0	Glancing toward the open door , he heard his name shouted again and recognized it was Arthur Cobb .
tr	3	And though he tried not to show it , what Chris felt most at that moment was pride .
tr	4	" Much can be deduced about an unknown vessel by the wood it was built from .
tr	4	For example , yellow pine and live oak and cypress reveal a ship built in the southern colonies .
tr	0	Chris dared another glance above and saw the man had ducked down a little , but only a little .
tr	1	Ducking low , Chris crawled up there to join him , lying down next to the man .
tr	0	After another minute , Lucas began his slow walk away from the hole toward his parked car .
tr	0	He paused a moment , turning away from Chris to stare down at the ship once again .
tr	3	It was more it was his hardest subject , the one he found most difficult to understand .
tr	3	But he did his best anyway , and tried not to get too frustrated with himself .
tr	2	The afternoon sky was robin 's egg blue , with high puffy clouds moving in lockstep across the horizon .
tr	4	So it surprised him when Barney asked , " How are things down at the shipwreck ? "
tr	3	The two came to the wooden stairway that went down the cliff leading to the boathouse entrance .
tr	2	Arthur had provided Chris a bunch of books on the subject , all of them boring as sin .
tr	3	But today , Cobb seemed strangely distracted , or at least uninterested in talking about it .
tr	2	While Chris studied , Cobb sat across from him on the couch , typing away on his laptop .
tr	3	And to think that I ... well , we ... anyway , it 's very exciting .
tr	2	" You know , I 've often wondered how I 'd make my mark on this world .
tr	4	In addition to whatever immigration crap he 'd have to memorize , he was leaving with some homework .
tr	1	Although plans were hush hush so as not to arouse more scavenging , Lucas himself was in the loop .
tr	0	Did she tell him it was all in the past , that she was a married woman now ?
tr	0	Lucas shook his head to think that not a week into her marriage she was already being unfaithful .
tr	0	He walked with a limp and had what looked like a perpetual scowl on his face .
tr	4	When Misty said wouldn 't it be nice for him to have a playmate , he almost screamed .
tr	0	Misty said Sarah couldn 't wait to see him again , while Chris stared daggers at his mother .
tr	1	He had since used that same somewhat satisfactory method on all five coins in his possession .
tr	3	It was obvious to him now he wasn 't going to get in all the searching he wanted to .
tr	4	But there was one last item he needed to look up before going off to bed .
tr	0	The man in the middle was the shortest , bald as a cue ball and about as round .
tr	0	You haven 't met anyone a that name in yer travels , have ya son ? "
tr	0	Though what loyalty he owed the man or why he had chosen to protect him he had no idea .
tr	1	Licking his thumbs , he began turning pages while glancing at the coin every now and then .
tr	3	Whatever that was , Chris figured it couldn 't be too hard to find , or to make .
tr	0	He gave Chris a wink and a half-smile before removing his hat and bowing his head .
tr	1	Chris headed in that direction , nodding his head in greeting to the man and his dog .
tr	0	Instead , after thinking about it , he asked , " Are you a pirate ? "
tr	2	When that got no reaction , he added , " And they 're looking for you . "
tr	1	I tell ya lad , if I lived in yer time , that 's what I 'd become .
tr	1	I had no business doin ' what I did , makin ' some a them decisions on me own .
tr	3	So in terms of not usin ' them , I 'm afraid it be too late fer that . "
tr	2	Looking more closely , he could just make out one of the Pillars of Hercules on one of them .
tr	1	You know anything unusual happens on the Rump , I wan na hear about it . "
tr	4	After a moment , he smiled and shook his head , remembering that was what this girl excelled at .
tr	4	Only then did he admit to himself he 'd secretly been curious how she turned out .
tr	2	" How did you know I 'd be down on the rocks , or ... up here ? "
tr	4	Glancing around , he figured that in another week or two , the beach would be full .
tr	0	Chris walked away from the water and onto the hard packed sand above , then began walking east .
tr	0	After a while , still carrying his shoes , he began jogging at a slow pace .
tr	0	Chris saw that Billy still wore the white pants and gingham shirt he had picked out for him .
tr	0	" No ... " the boy said , half turning as if about to crawl away again .
tr	4	After a while , it seemed the Spaniards took one look at the Lady Grace before givin ' up .
tr	0	" Anyway , wasn 't long after Sykes come on board that the captain went ashore in Tortuga .
tr	0	That , an ' I only been on board the ship fer half a year . "
tr	3	Chris still had a thousand questions , but asked the one that might tie things up .
tr	3	Deciding not to wait , Chris turned and headed toward the rear staircase that led up to the rooms .
tr	2	It was a common room of some sort , with a high ceiling and exposed beams .
tr	0	But it also appeared as though some had gone back and chosen something more ... appropriate .
tr	3	Chris turned to look to the pirates , who had their heads turned in his direction .
tr	0	Sadly , Chris looked up and saw the captain had taken no interest in what was going on .
tr	2	So , with nothing but his own assumptions to work with , he plowed ahead anyway .
tr	0	But when it became apparent that wasn 't going to happen , he raised his leg again .
tr	0	" But exactly how was our small company going to take on a ship a that size ?
tr	1	" They ran onto a sandbar in seventy mile an hour winds and thirty foot waves . "
tr	3	An ' yet ... on the other hand ... " He turned to look up at the captain .
tr	0	Turning to her , he saw she too had stood up and was applauding as loudly as the men .
tr	1	Placing his fingers on the chain link , Chris shook it a few times and felt it barely move .
tr	3	Chris let the captain think about that as they walked to the front of the Cove .
tr	3	It could be simply the burned out husk of something that had long outlived its usefulness .
tr	0	But it was obvious to all that a blow was coming , and so barge service ended early .
tr	2	By mid-afternoon , in a precursor of what was to come , the surf began to roil and surge .
tr	0	Another man named Hill , first mate of a ship called the Lady Grace , sat nearby .
tr	2	" Careful , boy , " the man said , patting his shoulder before going back to work .
tr	1	Chris glanced across the water and saw the high bluffs of the Rump moving swiftly past .
tr	1	Having sat in on some of the planning , he knew to expect some strange looking craft .
tr	1	Raising the Mary Rose , King Henry the VIII 's favorite ship , had taken many years .
tr	4	Only last summer , after not being seen in thirty-seven years , the bones showed up on the beach .
tr	4	Cobb had even asked Lucas himself to be on hand , for crowd control and police presence .
tr	3	Apparently , he had yet to recover his standing from his ill-fated attempt to take control of the ship .
tr	3	She was next to her aunt Misty , today dressed in a blue print dress and matching hat .
tr	1	And I 'm sure it 's nice to be so rich you can buy anything you want .
tr	0	They tend to hang around way above sea level , at the foot of mountains and tall plateaus .
tr	2	" You should really work with animals , become a vet or a zoologist or something .
tr	4	There was something different about her now that she was no longer buried in the sand .
tr	0	At the far end of the table sat a bald man in round glasses and an ill-fitting suit .
tr	0	They were waiting for Barney , who was in another part of the mansion having a physical exam .
tr	3	But this year , its trajectory would swing it perilously close to Earth on its journey to the sun .
tr	1	A third said his cousin was a laid-off maritime engineer who would love to be involved .
tr	2	The cop took a long slug of coffee while the intro music to his favorite show played .
tr	1	Puzzled , but unconcerned by this unusual occurrence , Lucas turned around and glanced up at the television .
tr	1	" It 's Chad 's , " Lucas said , surprised he 'd said it aloud .
tr	3	The captain had raised his head to stare up at the tall pine that dominated the green .
tr	3	Well , he thought , staring down at the treasures he 'd surreptitiously taken from the sand .
tr	3	Another claimed to be stranded , left with a car that wouldn 't start and needing a jump .
tr	2	With the group assembled , each man was assigned to one of a dozen or so boats .
tr	2	One by one , motors started , and the boats began to pull away from the dock .
tr	2	But it was obvious now his father was going to be around for a long time to come .
tr	4	Four of its six members were already quietly on board for the sale of Zimmerman Furniture to Decatur Heath .
tr	3	After watching only a few minutes , a now tight-lipped Lucas thought maybe the security guard was onto something .
tr	1	Dozens of men wearing bandanas on their faces or hats pulled low swarmed down on the unarmed man .
tr	4	Oh , she 'd been nice about it , saying they bumped into each other after church .
tr	3	~ Though he 'd heard rumors and scuttlebutt , the story wasn 't in the newspaper until Saturday morning .
tr	3	Though Arthur asked , the man couldn 't answer , not sure whether they 'd taken any or not .
tr	2	It was silly of him to be jealous of Billy , for a number of reasons .
tr	3	The crew settled down from their own raucous talking a moment to turn their attention to the captain .
tr	1	After taking long slugs from their drinks , they walked over and began pounding Chris on the back .
tr	1	But counterfeiting was serious stuff indeed , and not something he would tolerate in his jurisdiction .
tr	4	Moments later , through the crowd , Chris saw the bright red sheen of an old fire engine .
tr	1	Rising majestically from the back of the flatbed was a pirate ship made entirely of living things .
tr	1	Moments later , the cannon exploded , sending hundreds of dollar bills floating into the air .
tr	2	In fact , I 'm pleased to say I 've got some good news to report . "
tr	3	" And the storm that washed away the ship was kind enough to grace us with these items . "
tr	3	Halfway there , they began to hear banging and shouts and the sounds of construction from within the boathouse .
tr	4	He remembered from his night of Internet sleuthing that ships of this age often had two layers of planking .
tr	1	All around them was a symphony of sound : endless banging and shouts and the sound of machines .
tr	4	If anything , Chris thought , Sykes appeared even more covered in hairy goo than Billy .
tr	4	He had already turned when Sarah asked him , " When are we going to see you again ? "
tr	3	It 's almost as if ... " He stopped as if he didn 't want to say anything more .
tr	2	On the inside page was a photo of some loot laid out on his coffee table .
tr	4	He climbed the hill and ended up at his secret cloister behind the rocks above the nude beach .
tr	1	Opening his brown bag , Chris made himself comfortable and began eating his lunch while taking in the sights .
tr	0	And then came the insurance money , and it was almost like my father arranged for it to happen .
tr	0	Anyway , she 's happy , and that makes me happy , and that 's enough for now . "
tr	3	But that 's one of my biggest fears , that I 'll forget what my father looked like .
tr	0	She was smiling now , and had wiped away any hint of dampness that might have been there .
tr	0	Chris and Sarah arrived early , and even then found it hard to find a place to watch .
tr	1	Men stood on ladders and scaffolding all around the ship with paintbrushes and buckets in hand .
tr	4	Teams of other men came to quickly roll them away , and then the ship began to scream .
tr	4	Chris realized then the captain knew more than anyone the rest was out of his hands .
tr	0	He realized then too that Sarah was squeezing his hand so hard she 'd cut off his circulation .
tr	1	~ It was a glorious Sunday morning , as were all Sunday mornings on the Rump .
tr	1	As always , the minister woke to the sound of the first chirping bird and smiled .
tr	1	Turning on his heels , leaving one slipper behind , he ran back into the sanctuary .
tr	4	Glancing up , toward the steeple , he understood then they were coming from the church .
tr	1	They were clinging and clanking and making a monstrous noise , as if the devil himself were ringing them .
tr	4	The notebook contained the itinerary his conference coordinator had put together for the Labor Day weekend merger signing .
tr	2	That , and he 'd had the candied duck at the wedding and it was do die for .
tr	0	And then , with a sigh that was almost a moan , he realized he knew that he did .
tr	4	~ Though some left after the admittedly short and somewhat unusual service , most of the congregation remained .
tr	4	The sexton had announced at the beginning of services that the minister had taken to his bed .
tr	1	He was standing next to Misty Rowling 's granddaughter , who Lucas knew was in town for the summer .
tr	1	Course , it was also possible some kind of pine tree cult had sprung up on the island .
tr	1	What he did know now beyond any doubt was that something strange was going on around here .
tr	1	Once or twice , Chris retrieved an errant football for a group of boys playing nearby .
tr	3	They wandered past the T-shirt shop , the taffy booth , and the ice cream parlor .
tr	0	Turning to Sarah , he thanked her for a wonderful day but said he had to go .
tr	0	She smiled and punched him in the arm and said she 'd had fun too before walking away .
tr	2	" First , you have to promise you won 't hurt him , " Chris began .
tr	3	" After that show trial me crew put on , wit ' me at the end of a rope .
tr	3	" Well ... it 's just that you said once that the crew blamed you for what happened .
tr	4	After telling him everything he knew , the captain smiled and thanked him for the information .
tr	0	After the two said their goodbyes , and the captain walked away , Chris shouted after him .
tr	4	Upon arriving , many of these usually gruff men greeted each other with a curious , almost dainty bow .
tr	4	" If 'n ye don 't mind me askin , I fear the name has slipped me mind .
tr	3	And though this one supposedly paled to that , there was no doubt this thing was a comet .
tr	1	" They 're taking the ship for a trial run on Sunday and invited me along .
tr	3	Through the starlight drifting into his room , he saw three long foils were now pressed to his throat .
tr	3	As one , he felt the three sharp points retract a bit , but only a bit .
tr	4	" That not be the answer we come fer , " the man in the middle said .
tr	0	An ' young Billy may have mentioned a word or two about an angel he 'd met . "
tr	0	Glancing again at Sarah , Chris smiled too , thinking maybe it had been a dumb question .
tr	2	He dozed fitfully , waking up occasionally after being spooked by something , only to fall back to sleep .
tr	0	When Arthur saw he had a long knife in his hand , he took in a deep breath .
tr	0	When he saw Arthur stared nervously at his knife , he said , " What , this ? "
tr	3	Arthur still wasn 't quite sure what the man was talking about , but he wanted to hear more .
tr	4	He wanted to say he 'd watched the Holcombe sisters oversee the creation of entire pirate wardrobes .
tr	0	And if you believed the somewhat profane caption , Alf was having a very bad day indeed .
tr	1	The ship moved forward , ever forward , its progress marked by the daylight slowly inching across her deck .
tr	0	The smaller boats peeled off and away , and the Lady Grace was on her own .
tr	1	When she asked what he was thinking , he just smiled and said it was a long story .
tr	4	Out on the main deck , beneath the boom , a team began to work the halyard .
tr	0	At some point -- Chris wasn 't exactly sure when -- Sarah had taken his hand in hers .
tr	1	Chris smiled to realize it looked like a dog with its head out a car window .
tr	2	But to not bring along a lawyer or two to even look at the contracts before he signed ?
tr	1	~ The small sloop began harassing the tall ships just a few miles outside of Boston .
tr	2	Beyond that , a sea of crowds stood watching the parade from just outside the famed Boston Harbor Hotel .
tr	2	Others stood their ground and raised their cellphone cameras to record what was obviously a looming disaster .
tr	4	A minor panic broke out among those nearest the water as the ship began filling their horizon .
tr	0	" But Captain ... " he began , stopping when the captain gave him another cold look .
tr	0	Handing his first mate the binoculars , the captain said , " Have a closer look . "
tr	0	As always , his lawyer was wrinkled and unkempt , carrying his portfolio and a briefcase .
tr	3	He realized at that same moment why none of the board wanted anything to do with him today .
tr	4	He picked up the contracts Seth had already signed and began affixing his own signature to the documents .
tr	3	But now you mention it , he has been a little slow to pick up on things .
tr	3	In fact , I expect Seth will want to stay on far longer than just the one year . "
tr	0	However , I 'm afraid only annual stipends will be paid out , much like an allowance . "
tr	2	" Now , I 'm the last one to tell you how to run your business .
tr	1	He winked at Chris , reminding him that he 'd promised to make a pirate out of him .
tr	0	~ With the sun down , Chris and Sarah made their own final preparations to depart the Lady Grace .
tr	1	Catching on , Haskins said , " Now , wait a minute ... " Barney interrupted .
tr	0	Haskins was flabbergasted , but smiled to know at least he had something to hang his hat on .
tr	3	He watched as Cobb put on his little show , only to get the beat down from Barney .
tr	0	Turning to Sarah , he saw at a glance that she was as confused as he .
tr	0	When it did , he glanced toward Barney , who smiled and again began to speak .
tr	2	Turning to Haskins , he said , " Sounds to me like you have a court problem .
tr	4	Lucas reached up and pushed his hat back on his head , not sure where to begin .
tr	4	Removing the Maglite from his belt , he untied the string that held the bag closed and opened it .
tr	4	The mist that began just before they 'd departed the Lady Grace had only grown heavier over time .
tr	0	An unnatural thunderclap came from across the sea , followed by a blinding flash of green .
tr	3	In that instant , illuminated through the fog , was the outline of the Lady Grace at full sail .
tr	1	" If you don 't mind my asking , " Chris said , turning to Dawkins .
tr	1	But he 'd used his own discretion , and discretion was the most valuable tool in his arsenal .
tr	3	There would be other opportunities , other cases that would get him that promotion to detective .
tr	2	Minutes or hours later , he heard footfalls come down the stairs followed by a knock on his door .
tr	2	However , two of his works do survive in the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts .
tr	4	For what nefarious purpose had the two biggest criminal bosses in town set aside their differences ?
tr	4	I pulled my cell phone out of the rear pocket of my jeans and stared at it .
tr	1	You could presumably never die , ' Reid had argued with his customary logic when I told him this .
tr	3	I turned to watch the tail lights of the Chevrolet disappear in the downpour before getting into the lift .
tr	2	Jennings was found at the bottom of a ship 's cargo hold bound for the east coast .
tr	1	Homeless people scoured the alleys behind shops and stores , some pushing their worldly belongings in shopping carts .
tr	4	' Hunters are trained in the use of a range of weapons , ' I said quietly .
tr	1	Broken bottles , crushed cans , and dirty syringes littered the corridors on the upper floor .
tr	3	I swam further into the murky depths and twisted around until I floated in the eddies .
tr	4	Pausing beneath the canvas , I gazed at the mesmerising shades of blue for silent seconds .
tr	2	Of all of Monet 's works , this was the one I found the most soothing .
tr	1	To this day , he is still considered one of the most famous sword masters in Japanese history .
tr	0	A puzzled frown crossed the large man 's face , as if he was debating a difficult conundrum .
tr	4	Haus raised the blade in his right hand , screamed something unintelligible and came at me across the rooftop .
tr	1	Our swords clashed under the pounding rain just as a bolt of lightning streaked across the dark heavens .
tr	4	A roll of thunder tore the skies when the katana finally slipped past his guard moments later .
tr	3	After that , we kept in touch and went on to form a detective agency together in 1990 .
tr	0	They were said to be a lot smarter than dogs , although probably not as loyal .
tr	3	I put the phone on speaker , hooked it on my shirt and started to climb .
tr	0	I heard a distant twang and felt the draft of an arrow as it whizzed past my shoulder .
tr	2	I ducked past an open doorway , narrowly avoided another volley of bullets , and looked around frantically .
tr	2	I was a storey from the ground floor when the door at the bottom of the stairs suddenly opened .
tr	2	I looked over my shoulder : there was a crossbow bolt embedded halfway into the boot of the car .
tr	2	The interview room on the first floor offered a rare glimpse of the harbor and Boston 's downtown skyline .
tr	1	Despite the anger burning in my veins , I allowed a faint smile to cross my lips .
tr	2	No doubt he 'd have me thrown into a padded cell so fast my head would spin .
tr	4	' Meyer told you not to leave the city , ' said Reid after a while .
tr	2	' I 'm not going to change my mind about this , so don 't give me that look .
tr	0	Finally , I reached behind the panel and pulled out a large , flat , rectangular grey package .
tr	1	' The one in the Cayman Islands holds bonds for a dozen financial institutions around the world .
tr	4	I handed her the cat and placed a brown envelope on the table in the hallway .
tr	0	Solange was a small and exclusive jazz club situated in a leafy street off 3rd Avenue .
tr	2	At the bottom of the steps , mahogany double doors opened out onto a wide , sunken floor .
tr	0	A woman in a shimmering red cocktail dress stood on a raised circular stage to the far left .
tr	0	We walked through another pair of mahogany doors and entered a wide hallway with a polished parquet floor .
tr	4	' The immortal societies are ruled by nobles who form the Councils , ' he explained .
tr	2	Below them is the Congress of the Council , who function as local authority chiefs . '
tr	1	' The Hunters are essentially the assassins , bodyguards , policemen , and soldiers of the immortal nobles . '
tr	1	' I don 't understand why I should become a priority again after all this time .
tr	4	' Whatever or whoever they 're after , they 're getting desperate , ' said Solange quietly .
tr	2	' I hate to ask this of you , but do you think you can find out more ? '
tr	3	' Try to stay alive until I get to the bottom of this , I guess . '
tr	1	I wouldn 't know anything genetic or immunological if it bit me in the ass . '
tr	3	I thought about the Monet in my apartment and decided there and then never to tell him about it .
tr	0	It was a black and white photograph of a man and a woman taken at night .
tr	1	Still , I had no doubt our paths would cross again if I survived this night .
tr	4	My breaths slowed while I silently repeated the mantra taught to me by my Edo master .
tr	0	The katana danced and weaved through the air , spilling blood across the walls and the floorboards .
tr	1	' I would be lying if I said we weren 't involved , ' I said carefully .
tr	0	We drove down Massachusetts Avenue , took a right on 5th Street and parked along a small side road .
tr	1	he said in thick Mandarin , squinting suspiciously in the glow cast by a nearby street lamp .
tr	4	' Because I suspect we 're going to need them before the week 's over , ' I replied .
tr	4	Eight hours after we left Baltimore , we landed on a deserted airfield thirty miles outside Paris .
tr	4	He dropped our bags in the boot of the car and climbed into the passenger seat .
tr	4	I slipped behind the wheel and ran my fingers lovingly over the dashboard and the gearbox .
tr	3	' On the other hand , I wouldn 't mind getting my fingers on that little beauty . '
tr	3	' I take it it 's the kind of business you can 't talk about . '
tr	3	' Well , if there 's anything I can do to help , don 't hesitate to ask . '
tr	3	What I meant was , something -- out of the ordinary , mysterious -- unnatural even ? '
tr	0	Steam billowed out and was followed by the fragrant aroma of slow cooked meat and vegetables .
tr	0	The address was a detached house in a narrow road not far from the metro station .
tr	4	Lights were still on behind the ground floor windows when we pulled up some fifty yards from the property .
tr	0	The address was an apartment located in an old neoclassical building halfway down a quiet cul-de-sac .
tr	1	' Sorry to bother you , ' I said hastily after confirming her details and returned to the car .
tr	2	Lights from the first and fourth floors bathed a narrow brick patio in a golden glow .
tr	0	Outlined starkly against the back wall of the apartment block was an elaborate , spiral iron fire escape .
tr	0	The lack of rust suggested that it was a fairly new addition to the otherwise grand and faded facade .
tr	4	I put the painting back on the wall , knelt down and peered under the bed .
tr	3	Chapter Seven We left the apartment minutes later and took the stairs to the ground floor .
tr	4	A row of letter boxes flanked the wall just inside the front doors of the building .
tr	3	I took out the key we had taken from Strauss 's apartment and studied it thoughtfully .
tr	3	It took a couple of minutes to override the security system at the back of the building .
tr	0	A staff board on the wall indicated that the professor worked in a laboratory two levels up .
tr	2	At the end of a corridor on the ground floor , we found a staff changing room .
tr	1	" ' Hope this brings you inspiration " , signed " A " , ' I quoted quietly .
tr	1	' I make four of them , ' I said quietly , hands hanging loosely at my sides .
tr	4	The SUV hurtled into one of the haystacks , skidded wildly and smashed head first into an electric pole .
tr	0	' I think whatever they 're searching for has something to do with his work . '
tr	1	' I don 't know whether to call it coincidence or irony , ' said Reid flatly .
tr	3	I put the receiver down and tried to ignore the pang of guilt that stabbed through my chest .
tr	4	Shortly after eight , we left the car and ascended the slope towards the rear of the property .
tr	0	A pair of sturdy walking boots and a lone umbrella stood leaning against the wall outside the back door .
tr	2	On the ground floor , a study lined with floor to ceiling bookcases looked out onto the lake .
tr	2	Once in the room , I took out Strauss 's journal and laid it on the coffee table .
tr	0	Almost a mile long , it was also home to the Zurich Hauptbahnhof , Switzerland 's largest railway station .
tr	1	She flushed , stammered a quick ' Thank you ' in Swiss German and hurried down the stairs .
tr	0	At the end of the passage was a door with the nameplate " Godard " affixed to it .
tr	2	She stood in the doorway to the lab and wore a suspicious frown on an otherwise pretty face .
tr	0	A tall man with blond dreadlocks came up behind her and blinked at us through thick bifocals .
tr	4	' We 're investigating the death of a scientist in France , a Professor Hubert Strauss .
tr	4	She stood frowning at the phone for several seconds , turned and slowly retraced her steps .
tr	2	Further along the busy concourse , not far from the next intersection , stood a flower shop .
tr	4	There were at least fifteen of them , dressed in black suits and armed with guns and swords .
tr	3	The tip of the blade struck the ground next to my ear , raising sparks from the floor .
tr	3	At the top of the stairs , daylight framed the doorway to a bustling street outside the station .
tr	2	It crossed the heavy traffic and headed for the old man and the wounded woman running down the road .
tr	4	I remained silent while I pulled into the heavy traffic : I could feel his gaze on my face .
tr	1	' I think she 's the little girl in the picture , ' I said quietly .
tr	0	' Does this mean that Strauss was also an immortal , or at least aware of their existence ? '
tr	4	Reid studied me for several seconds before pulling a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket .
tr	3	' All right , Vienna it is then , ' he muttered under his breath and struck a match .
tr	2	The level of noise dropped fractionally so that my next words almost echoed across the room .
tr	1	I 'm afraid it 's no longer in production , ' she said with a disparaging sniff .
tr	4	Reid shifted uneasily in his seat and placed his hand carefully on his leg , inches from the Glock .
tr	0	He grabbed a chair from a nearby table and dragged it across the floor to ours .
tr	0	The cafe was small and rundown but proved an ideal place to watch the tavern from .
tr	1	' I forgot about the underground passages , ' I replied , silently cursing my immortal mind .
tr	4	The temperature dropped dramatically the deeper we went inside the tunnels and the water gradually subsided .
tr	3	' I think this leads to the cellar under the tavern , ' I said hesitantly .
tr	2	A thin stream of water coursed along the shallow grooves in the floor in front of us .
tr	0	I glimpsed a pale light fading around a corner at the end of the passage on the far right .
tr	0	The chamber itself was a narrow rectangular cell with four bare stone walls and no other apparent exits .
tr	1	I 'm looking for a man and a woman who arrived in Vienna by train tonight . '
tr	0	From his tone and his words , I concluded that he was also a Bastian immortal .
tr	1	His bodyguards drew identical semi-automatic pistols from inside their coats and fell into step behind him .
tr	3	The men at the rear of the chasing pack turned at the sound of our footsteps .
tr	4	An eerie feeling of familiarity stole over me again as I studied the older man 's face .
tr	1	I gazed blindly out of the window , my mind abuzz with a myriad of questions .
tr	4	We had just driven past a deserted park when a flash of movement to the right caught my eyes .
tr	4	The two riders atop each of the sleek machines wore dark helmets and leather biker suits .
tr	0	The car flipped twice , metal crumpling against the asphalt and giving way with a grating noise .
tr	4	A shadow loomed in front of me and a pair of polished shoes appeared before my eyes .
tr	1	' Well , you did say they were " invisible " , ' I said drily .
tr	4	The Frenchman glared at me for several seconds before looking at the papers in front of him .
tr	2	The bodyguard wiped his bloodied mouth with the back of his hand and moved his lower jaw sideways gingerly .
tr	3	And , quite frankly , with that shitty attitude of yours , I wouldn 't blame him . '
tr	4	They were led by the Austrian investigator who had been in the interview room with Lacroix .
tr	2	' I 'm afraid that information is on a need to know basis only , ' he said smoothly .
tr	1	A second later , I was behind the desk , Lacroix 's gun still gripped firmly in my hands .
tr	0	Reid had grabbed a paperclip from the desk and was working his way through our handcuffs .
tr	1	' I didn 't know you were a swordsman , ' I said steadily as I drew myself upright .
tr	1	Olsson 's eyes widened in shocked surprise as he desperately pressed his hands against the wound at his throat .
tr	2	Already , I could hear the sharp calls of crows coming from the rooftop of the building .
tr	3	The Austrian officers still standing stared at us hesitantly , uncertain as to how to proceed .
tr	2	I still didn 't understand what Olsson had meant , nor did I know who he had alluded to .
tr	4	Fifty feet ahead and to the left , an elderly gentleman was locking the door of his Volvo estate .
tr	4	A second later , several black clad figures emerged from the shadows on either side of us .
tr	2	It was followed by irate yells and the ricochet of bullets bouncing off the back of the Volvo .
tr	3	' Get the bullets out and stitch him up , ' he said to me curtly .
tr	4	' Godard used to be the Head of the Order of Bastian Hunters , ' he said .
tr	1	' He abdicated his position in the fifteen hundreds for reasons unknown to immortals outside the First Council . '
tr	4	' The majority of us believe he will be the next Head of the Hunters though .
tr	0	' Oh , and twenty-four hours after that , he killed him again , ' said Reid wryly .
tr	4	A house stood at the far end of the clearing , in the lee of the grey rock face .
tr	4	The words had barely left his lips when the windows on the first floor blew out .
tr	2	' They 'll probably lay low for a while and catch up with us later . '
tr	1	Hot shrapnel and burning fragments shot out from the wreckage and rained down from the sky .
tr	4	I looked over my shoulder and saw dozens of figures emerge from the trees next to the house .
tr	1	Moments later , the crash of footsteps and the shouts of our pursuers rose behind us .
tr	3	More bullets whistled through the air from the right and scored a tree as I darted past it .
tr	1	My gaze strayed to the blood dripping down Reid 's left arm as we continued running north .
tr	2	I skidded to a halt on the muddy , leaf covered ground and stumbled back towards him .
tr	2	I reached him in time to see blood bloom across his shirt from a fresh bullet wound .
tr	1	His breathing grew laboured , the air rattling in and out of his lips in shallow pants .
tr	4	A man walked out from under the line of trees to the west of the clearing .
tr	0	Hundreds of years of instinct warned me that this was not a man I dared look away from .
tr	3	Despite the radiance that bathed the clearing , it was too dark to fathom the colour of his eyes .
tr	4	Though I could not recall ever having met him before , the stranger looked disturbingly familiar .
tr	2	A gush of frothy blood rose in my throat and spilled past my lips , choking my breath .
tr	3	The stranger smiled wildly , raised a booted foot to my thigh and pulled the sword out .
tr	0	Moonlight shone on the edge of his sword as he raised it high above his head .
tr	4	Or yet still , was this the anteroom where my final fate awaited me even now ?
tr	3	She sat back slightly , the sun cross pendant glinting at the base of her throat .
tr	3	Sunlight streamed through a pair of gauzy white curtains framing a tall window to the left .
tr	2	I sipped , then gulped the cold liquid down quickly , suddenly aware of my thirst .
tr	3	' They all made it , ' said Anna , ' but not without some injuries . '
tr	1	His left arm was in a sling and I could see the outline of dressings beneath his shirt .
tr	0	The light outside was fading when I finally made my way to the head of a grand staircase .
tr	2	From what I had glimpsed through the window of my room , it stood on a deserted estate .
tr	0	' You always were impatient , even as a child , ' he said , gazing at me warmly .
tr	3	By the time Victor told me they were on their trail again , it was too late .
tr	3	' It was my father who issued the order on the Bastian side , ' said Victor curtly .
tr	0	I always heard of your deaths at the hands of the Hunters , ' Godard replied with a grimace .
tr	3	' Is that why you didn 't want me to get involved with -- whatever 's going on ? '
tr	0	' You gave us all quite a shock when you started breathing again , ' he said bluntly .
tr	3	' I 'm afraid I don 't know the answer to that question , ' he murmured .
tr	4	I pondered out loud , thinking of the Angel of Death again and the unique birthmark over my heart .
tr	3	Victor assured us that only he and his father knew the exact location of the property .
tr	0	' Advanced cell -- ' ' Advanced cell cycle control and DNA transposition , ' said Anna .
tr	2	' Slow down cell production and you control the cancer , ' I said , staring at her .
tr	2	' I have another snippet of information for you , ' the immortal continued , gazing at me .
tr	4	The flames in the hearth popped and crackled loudly while I absorbed this new piece of information .
tr	0	she said , indicating the array of hardware laid out on the mahogany desk in the study .
tr	3	' I should insist that you get some rest , but I could do with the help . '
tr	3	' That doesn 't sound good , ' said Reid in the taut silence that followed .
tr	0	If the immortal war was to start again , thousands of humans would be caught in the crossfire . '
tr	0	' That won 't happen , ' said Victor with an adamant shake of his head .
tr	0	There was a small diagram in the margin that I had not paid particular attention to before .
tr	4	' It 's an exact mirror image of the other one , ' she said with rising excitement .
tr	1	' When you say control the cell cycle ... ' I trailed off as understanding finally began to dawn .
tr	3	As I stared at the vial in her hand , I felt a cold suspicion trickle through my thoughts .
tr	4	Chapter Fifteen At five in the morning , the Prague Institute of Molecular Genetics was dark and deserted .
tr	1	We broke in through a side door and went in search of the Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics department .
tr	4	Reid and Anatole took up guard duty outside the room while Anna and I entered the lab .
tr	0	Anna moved swiftly from one complicated apparatus to another , her fingers gliding confidently over keypads and dials .
tr	4	The next hour passed at a snail 's pace while we watched a large machine hum quietly .
tr	2	It doesn 't mean I 'll stop you from doing so once he 's here . '
tr	0	' They 're trying to kill you and Lucas , ' he said gruffly , glancing at his granddaughter .
tr	1	' The First Council already knows , ' said a voice in a quiet yet ominous tone .
tr	1	' After all , Marcus , you tried to kill his only son and successor . '
tr	4	He headed along the corridor that led to the kitchen and opened the door to the cellar .
tr	1	' He 's a scary man , ' said Reid , strolling down the stairs behind me .
tr	0	Anatole leaned against the wall to the side , a frown darkening his normally jovial countenance .
tr	2	How such a weakling could come from the bloodline of Tomas Godard -- ' He stopped abruptly .
tr	1	' The tip of this blade is exactly an inch from your heart , ' I said slowly .
tr	4	' And it was his seventeenth death at that , ' Anatole announced cheerfully in the silence that followed .
tr	1	' My dear , as much as I dislike admitting it , Victor 's right , ' said Tomas .
tr	1	Suicide would be going in without a plan , ' said Victor with a faint smile .
tr	3	I straightened , my attention now totally focused on the Head of the Order of Bastian Hunters .
tr	4	' I never met the man myself , ' the older man continued , stepping out of the shade .
tr	1	Time and time again , the tip of his sword came within a whisper of my skin .
tr	4	He stood frozen in the middle of the clearing , the edge of my katana over his heart .
tr	1	' However , I think you will find that my blade is also touching your chest . '
tr	1	' Your old man still has it in him , ' said Roman , leaning on the longsword .
tr	1	' I 'm afraid many of us lost lives during our conflicts with the Ottoman Empire . '
tr	2	' Do you know how much a bottle of that would fetch on the open market ? '
tr	3	I watched the doorknob turn again and tried to quieten the rapid thuds of my heart .
tr	3	I took the earpiece out , strode across the study and turned to stare at the others .
tr	2	' So what , you 're saying you 're gon na fight all of them ? '
tr	2	' Still , you have far to go before you can hope to defeat me , boy . '
tr	4	He touched the scar on his right cheek absent-mindedly and left a crimson trail on his pale skin .
tr	1	He struck over and over again , his tip of his sword slicing through the air in invisible moves .
tr	0	He coughed and took a rasping breath , a stream of red bubbles staining his lips .
tr	4	Our breaths plumed the chilly air with small white clouds as we raced towards the boundary of the estate .
tr	4	A crescent moon shone brightly in the clear autumn sky and bathed the woods in a silvery light .
tr	3	' For a moment there , I thought you weren 't going to make it . '
tr	4	I scrolled down the list of files and clicked on the one entitled " Red Death " .
tr	4	He rose from his seat and stepped forward with a purposeful stride , a heavy frown clouding his face .
tr	2	' No one knows the working of that woman 's mind , ' said Tomas Godard .
tr	3	I thought of the woman I had met earlier that evening and felt a chill at his words .
tr	1	It seems they 're still in the process of manufacturing it , ' she said slowly .
tr	0	' I 'm afraid it 's an area I know little about , ' she said .
tr	3	We need to stop them from getting their hands on Anna , ' said Tomas Godard .
tr	4	' What makes you think he 'd be willing to help us after all these years ? '
tr	0	We made our way across the field towards the waiting party , Victor leading the way .
tr	3	' I have to say , my section hasn 't exactly had a lot to do with that . '
tr	4	To be honest , we haven 't seen that kind of action since the days of the war . '
tr	4	' The rest of us were justifiably shocked and horrified , to say the least . '
tr	0	' Who knows what the future holds , ' he said , a shrewd light gleaming in his eyes .
tr	4	I believe only she and Thorne know the identities of the possible traitors in your midst . '
tr	0	' We 've located eight Bastian and human scientists specialising in the areas that you wanted .
tr	1	Roman walked past one of the windows of the study ; he was talking on his cell and frowning .
tr	4	' Luckily , we 've found an alternative if somewhat unconventional route to get inside . '
tr	4	' We 've identified three other access points into the facility ; here , here and here .
tr	0	Beyond that , an impenetrable wall of compacted earth , wood and rock barred the way .
tr	1	The light from our torch beams washed over rusting roof bolts and girders supporting a low , irregular ceiling .
tr	3	' There had better not be rats , ' the immortal murmured to no one in particular .
tr	3	It took three of us to twist open the stiff , circular wheel that sealed it shut .
tr	3	I slipped the katana out of its scabbard and gripped the handle of the Glock tightly .
tr	1	' Be careful , ' I said stiffly , trying to qualm the ominous foreboding growing inside me .
tr	3	Beyond the transparent walls , lights glowed and winked on instruments sitting atop the work surfaces of a lab .
tr	3	' If I was a betting man , I 'd go with the latter option . '
tr	3	The first stirrings of anger rose above the feelings of dread that still twisted through my gut .
tr	3	' See if you can find anything on the computers , ' I told the two immortals .
tr	0	Tubes and wires dotted his arms and legs , and he was attached to an array of silent machines .
tr	1	' It 's me , ' said Bruno , staring past the barrels of our guns .
tr	3	' That 's very altruistic and admirable , but still kinda dumb , ' he eventually muttered .
tr	4	I rose unsteadily to my feet and stared at the impenetrable barrier with a sinking feeling .
tr	0	The Bastian Hunter nodded and leaned heavily against the wall , sweat and blood streaming down his pale face .
tr	3	Sweat drenched my face and clothes , turning the dirt that coated my skin into grimy rivulets .
tr	1	I lay stunned for several seconds , before blinking and choking on a mouthful of dirt .
tr	3	' We couldn 't afford to lose the virus or have it spread through contact with the air . '
tr	0	The land levelled out after about a quarter of an hour and the truck braked to a brief halt .
tr	0	I was aware of a cavernous space around me as the transport chamber was manoeuvred across the floor .
tr	4	For the next hour , I resigned myself to being poked and prodded by Anna and the other scientists .
tr	4	' I don 't know , ' she said finally , her eyes meeting mine steadily .
tr	2	It took all of my willpower to reach out and take her gloved hand into my own shaking one .
tr	2	I had been given a room on the ground floor at the back of the main lodge .
tr	1	' We 're in Virginia , in the Blue Ridge Mountains , ' said Reid at my side .
tr	4	As we drew closer to the city , the tension inside the vehicle we travelled in rose palpably .
tr	3	' Rest assured that our organization will do the utmost to prevent any such misfortunes . '
tr	0	' I 'm afraid that to say more would indeed , as Costas states , reveal too much . '
tr	4	He turned to the surveillance photos of the Pennsylvania Avenue sky rise spread across the hood of a vehicle .
tr	1	' In any case , your men won 't be going higher than the tenth floor . '
tr	4	Reid and Lacroix emptied their guns into the immortals before they had a chance to reach for their weapons .
tr	3	Bullets from the gunfight in the foyer struck the doors with dull thuds as they closed after us .
tr	3	' Looks like these lifts don 't go any higher without a security pass , ' he said thoughtfully .
tr	2	' I guess we 're just gon na have to make our way on foot from here on . '
tr	4	I lifted a hand and wiped away the sliver of blood where the bullet had grazed my cheek .
tr	0	' We can 't be far from the research facility , ' I said with a frown .
tr	4	Consisting of a network of large glass chambers , they occupied the entire level of the building .
tr	2	Halfway across the floor , movement out of the corner of my eyes caught my attention .
tr	4	' They 've cleared the labs , ' I said with a frown when we paused before it .
tr	4	Thorne held my gaze for a moment before walking out onto the terrace to join them .
tr	2	It took far too many precious seconds to carve a path through the wall of immortals .
tr	0	A cry of pain escaped his lips when a bullet whizzed past me and struck his hand .
tr	3	The FBI helicopter had fired at the Bell 222 in an attempt to force its pilot to land .
tr	3	Heart thudding wildly against my ribs , I grabbed the silver cases and leapt through the port door .
tr	4	Thirty minutes had passed since the Bell helicopter had crashed into a tower next to the Lee Highway .
tr	0	A few yards away , McCabe was attempting to pacify the Arlington District Two police commander .
tr	2	We saw the first column of smoke when we still two miles out from the compound .
tr	4	The tall metal gates guarding the entrance to the complex were hanging off their hinges when we reached them .
tr	2	Bombs had churned up clods of earth and dug craters into the ground around the main lodge .
tr	1	Shouts and cries of pain echoed across the grounds as more Bastian Hunters returned to consciousness .
tr	4	' They crashed the system but we 've managed to regain access to eighty percent of the network . '
tr	3	' That 's too long , ' I said , not bothering to hide the resentment in my voice .
tr	0	I paused in front of a desk and trailed my fingers across the back of Anna 's chair .
tr	3	' At least half the immortals on the planet are no longer trying to kill you . '
tr	2	He 's the commander of the base and an old friend , ' said Victor by way of introduction .
tr	4	The light was fading fast when we made our final descent to the base several hours later .
tr	3	' As to what happens after that , I 'm not in a position to comment . '
tr	2	It took all of my concentration to quell the nervous tension building inside me and focus on my moves .
tr	3	' I hate to think what might happen if we eat too close to take-off . '
tr	1	A thin , crimson trickle coursed down his neck and stained the collar of his shirt .
tr	1	A moment later , a soft ping sounded and the panels swung open with a faint hiss .
tr	1	' How did you -- ' Olsson 's voice was interrupted by Reid 's near silent shot .
tr	2	' I will kill you without a second thought if you don 't do as I say . '
tr	3	' For a mortal , you sure are taking things lightly , ' he spat out .
tr	2	This he directed at Olsson , who stood nursing a wounded leg with a scowl on his face .
tr	1	' He 's fighting his way into the command room as we speak , ' said Victor .
tr	1	' I suspect his fingerprint and retinal scan will get you through here , ' I said to Victor .
tr	0	The Bastian immortal removed a pair of Steyr AUG rifles from his backpack and handed one to Reid .
tr	4	' I never got to tell how much I -- ' Her voice trailed into silence .
tr	4	' I never imagined that you of all people would betray us so , ' he said softly .
tr	3	' Victor 'll have a heart attack if we let you -- ' ' Victor will understand ! '
tr	0	She wiped a tear away with an angry frown and slipped the Glock into my hand .
tr	3	' Well , I can 't exactly argue with that , ' he said in a disgruntled tone .
tr	1	Shots bounced off the blade as I climbed the first steps , Victor and Costas close at my back .
tr	3	Without pausing for breath , I lifted the Smith & Wesson and shot Olsson point blank in the chest .
tr	4	A heartbeat later , his blade glided down the edge of mine and arched towards my chest .
tr	2	Out of the corner of my eyes , I saw a figure appear in the doorway to the rooftop .
tr	4	There was a flash of steel ahead of me ; Thorne 's blade hummed millimetres past my face .
tr	1	Anna rose in front of our grandfather 's still form and stared fearlessly into the barrel of the pistol .
tr	0	It had fallen out of the top of Anna 's hospital gown and lay against her chest .
tr	0	I sagged to my knees by my grandfather 's side , my heart hammering painfully against my ribs .
tr	0	Anatole appeared ; blood was oozing from a nasty wound in the immortal 's right flank .
tr	3	The golden retriever puppy panting at his side stopped in its tracks and turned towards the approaching boat .
tr	4	He looked to the clear waters beyond the veranda and the puppy playing on the beach .
tr	0	' Adam 's descendants are said to have lived many hundreds of years , ' said Anna finally .
tr	4	The clues , although we have yet to fully analyze the information , are in their genes . '
tr	1	I glanced into Anna 's widening eyes and murmured , ' What do you mean ? '
tr	0	I said stiffly , although I already had a suspicion what his answer was going to be .
tr	1	Is not funny at all when I knew that my school project was supposing to leave England .
tr	1	If I will give up on my project , I can say bye to my future .
tr	2	" Well , my loves , good luck and have fun , now all aboard ! "
tr	2	Sure she was home trying to break down my door , very nosy about my room .
tr	1	Many cars in traffic , and the driver started to swear in Greek , strongly honking .
tr	4	My colleague asked , with a slight scare in her voice , a fear that she installed in me .
tr	3	As long I was a ghost for the rest of the world , so much the better .
tr	1	Same streets , white buildings and agglomerated , palm trees and of course thousands of shops .
tr	4	I opened my eyes giddy and jumped over the bed to the door , outside was dark .
tr	3	" But we have the permission to leave the hotel , without asking that blond bimbo ? "
tr	3	" Sorry but ... " and when to say a phrase , a waiter thought to interrupt me .
tr	1	The girl in front of me was looking very happy ; instead , I was a little rigid .
tr	2	" A ... yes , honestly I don 't know who you are ... " I said all red .
tr	0	Well my name is Abigail Woods , but you can call me Abby , I hate my name . "
tr	2	" You will become a good psychologist " I joked , thankful that she was laughing .
tr	2	" It 's my passion to help people , or at least how much I can .
tr	4	" The project presumes a search over a subject , human , to name it properly .
tr	3	Doesn 't matter , I alone will go to the airport or seaport , without any help .
tr	1	" I 'm not doing anything , I was just wondering if you hit your head . "
tr	1	I was thinking that she was ruminating at what I said and felt like under the microscope .
tr	2	" The psychology , notions , definitions , will not be able to help you Damian .
tr	0	" Not a problem " I laughed with Abby , knowing that wasn 't a tragedy .
tr	3	Something tells me that you didn 't get one , that 's why you are so clumsy . "
tr	2	" I did ... but ... " " You didn 't read it , " she continued .
tr	0	The apartment was big , and the main hall made a connection to the living room .
tr	1	She took my hand and we went into the living room , I felt blushing again .
tr	4	We rented for the summer ... , " she said with her eyes in another direction .
tr	0	On a bed , an athletic and black hair boy , was standing back towards the door .
tr	3	But the thought that she will go with a lunatic , gave me chills on the back .
tr	1	she said , turning to him , who smiled to her while he was listening to music .
tr	4	I really wanted to know her much more , now that she admits I am dear to her .
tr	1	Lars and Helen were dancing , for my surprise Lars did not praise himself for no propose .
tr	2	Abby and I looked at each other and we went out , with Lars , off the door .
tr	2	I forgot to tell you , I took a holiday from my work ... How have you been ? "
tr	0	" Ok ... aaa , diagnosed with schizophrenia ... bla bla bla ... and ... Depression .
tr	4	For the first time , from when I came in Greece , I wanted to make Laurence a visit .
tr	0	I turned away with a flea in mine 's ear and walked slowly with a pain in my soul .
tr	3	I was so anger at the thought that I have to endure a whole month without her affection .
tr	3	If the drivers will caught that you are not from the town , they can trick you so easily .
tr	1	" Aaa , , Dublin is in Ireland , has nothing to do with England . "
tr	1	" If Dublin is the England 's capital , then Dublin is the capital of which state ? "
tr	1	He smiled at me , as if I just said he has a brilliant mind , talking seriously .
tr	3	Please , don 't start to look after me ; I 'm to upset to talk with you .
tr	3	I thank him , paid and get off from the car but suddenly I stood stiff .
tr	4	" How was it mom ... what did you feel ... when my father died ? "
tr	0	After how was normal and how I expected , nothing I could hear , just a sigh .
tr	3	But I didn 't know why , this time I could stay calm and eat like that as well .
tr	3	I talked with Mr. Bins , and he told me that Abigail Woods lied with the all month staying .
tr	3	Therefore , I got up from my table and exit the hotel 's restaurant , satiated .
tr	2	I stood with my front head on the door , unwilling to go back in the past .
tr	4	I couldn 't ignore the voice ; therefore I opened the door , looking at her white slippers .
tr	2	" I know you hate me , but I will not let you to ignore me again .
tr	2	Abby looked at me almost crying , I just looked back at her with no reaction .
tr	3	But you lied , telling me a bunch of craps that I have to stay here a bloody month .
tr	3	" The answer to the both lies is : I didn 't want you to go !
tr	1	I looked on the window straight in the parking lot and I didn 't saw nothing unusual .
tr	2	So I took my purse and I left my room through the door , closing automatically by its self .
tr	2	Maybe he took a walk or maybe he doesn 't want to open the door for me .
tr	3	But I didn 't said nothing , trying to look at her face with over makeup .
tr	0	I made room to a man to take his tickets , and I put my hands on my head .
tr	0	He smiled again , probably having fun on me , but I was to preoccupy with my face .
tr	4	I opened the envelope , being very curious and started to read it : " My dear Abby .
tr	1	I sat on my chair and playing with the little spoon in my coffee , watching in gol .
tr	2	" You know Abby , I don 't know , with you I feel much myself .
tr	2	And if I would tell you , probably you would freak out and you would run away from me .
tr	2	I don 't know what to say Abby ; I like you to much to loose you . "
tr	4	He steered the wheel to the left and parked slowly the car on some rocks , stopping the engine .
tr	4	I felt my eyes free and my first looks were two white lounge chairs , a flaming torch .
tr	4	Lars asked me , even him being nervous by the way he was rubbing his hands .
tr	0	Lars took my hand softly and drove me to the lounge chairs , taking a seat .
tr	2	Probably in his place , I would go crazy , or who knows what I was capable of doing .
tr	3	Was a little hut , I got in and was indeed a bath with mirrors and toilets .
tr	3	I took out the red lipstick from my little bag and a little make-up to look fresh .
tr	3	I didn 't think twice and started to run to the car , but he reached me faster .
tr	3	But no more matter , I had to stay away from Laurence , until will not be too late .
tr	4	I was no longer able to talk because of the fright and of the unstoppable crying .
tr	1	Chapter VII - The Trip I prepared my mini bad for this trip in the mountains .
tr	1	She didn 't got a kick ass from Damian , but definitely from me she will have it .
tr	0	You are a good kid same as him , just that he has a little problem . "
tr	4	And I woke up hugged by him and after that he kissed my forehead like a true parent .
tr	3	" Yes but ... " " I told you , I don 't want to talk about this . "
tr	1	I arrived at the third floor , gasping , and I saw him at his door .
tr	3	But you lied , telling me a bunch of craps that I have to stay here a bloody month .
tr	3	But I had to tell him the reason , so I took a deep breath and I rattled .
tr	3	" The answer to the both lies is : I didn 't want you to go !
tr	3	I agreed and I got up , putting the empty glass on the table , heading towards the door .
tr	4	Even if somehow I knew how possibly sent me one , I take it and look too see it .
tr	1	I don 't know what happened , I just woke up this morning , realizing I was in bed .
tr	3	Probably he wanted to tell me about his illness , not knowing that I already knew about it .
tr	0	I was a coward and I couldn 't decide what I wanted , Damian as a friend or lover ?
tr	3	I was anxious , but in the same time I wanted to look hypocrite and upset .
tr	3	I 'm scared , but it 's my fault that I didn 't told you from the beginning .
tr	4	" Please Laurence , have faith , anything you will tell me will not change the situation . "
tr	3	I really don 't know what to say , just that this Alex took care for hurting me . "
tr	3	I lied him , but that truth with the rape thing he has not to know .
tr	0	Jay said with a warm smile , and I hated myself for lying but what could I do .
tr	4	" Helen , don 't your feet are dead because of that high hills you wearing ?
tr	3	" Of course I knew , but I didn 't know what to dress with . "
tr	3	Laurence smiled to me without answering my question , going to the luggage , starting to unpack them .
tr	3	If he didn 't want to tell me , means that he had a good reason for it .
tr	3	It 's not just for a small cute family trip , I know it 's something more then that .
tr	1	The fire was inflaming in me and I was about to do anything for finding my answer .
tr	0	Was a silent night , only the crickets and some barks father away could be heard .
tr	3	To bad that only in the summer I can see it , when it is so hot outside . "
tr	2	I brought you here and Damian Jones too , on this island on this case . "
tr	2	" What I will about to tell you , will be our little secret , ok ? "
tr	2	You implicated with your soul , you look at people , as they are , human .
tr	4	Even if ironically , he wants to become a psychologist and he has a big problem . "
tr	4	She entered the house , leaving me on the bench with the glass in my hands , thinking .
tr	3	How interesting was to discover the truth , but more sadly was with Damian , poor of him .
tr	3	" But you told me to not tell ... " " To not tell him now .
tr	3	" I still don 't understand why we took luggage with us just for two days ? "
tr	1	Was coming from the opened balcony , the silk curtains was waving in the hands of the wind .
tr	0	Of course was familiar to me , he was ... " You 're Damian 's father . "
tr	2	You are the only person which stood near my son , who can help him . "
tr	1	Sorry Mr. Jones , but I ... I don 't actually believe in this paranormal things . "
tr	0	My family did not agree for me to see a usual , peasant , a commoner human .
tr	3	That is why Abigail , do everything that can stands in your power to help him ! "
tr	2	" If you want to know something , why you just don 't ask the source ? "
tr	3	Ok , the truth ... did he wanted the really truth or the truth that I spoke with Mara ?
tr	1	On the other hand , myself was looking down , Damian 's face coming into my mind .
tr	1	He didn 't say anything and we went to his room , seating on the bed .
tr	2	If you 'll make just one step throw that door , you will loose me for good ! "
tr	2	" I took care of calling you teacher and to tell her what you 're doing on the island .
tr	3	I didn 't want to stay in that hotel a bit , but until morning what should I do ?
tr	0	I can tell , after so many hits , plus that you smash your head on the parking border .
tr	3	" No ... It 's impossible ... means that ... with the love thing was a plan ? "
tr	2	But I love you so much and I want to spend my life with you . "
tr	3	I wasn 't surprise at all , but I didn 't think to take an umbrella or something .
tr	0	When I was about to take one , an old man was faster then me , taking it .
tr	1	I couldn 't be indifferent by Damian 's situation , I had to see how he was doing .
tr	1	Maybe I was doing a wrong thing with Laurence , to become the future Miss Mill , Abigail Mill .
tr	4	I watched the signs on the each house I passed it , which was written the number .
tr	1	I knocked again , but this time with a bit of more straight , like a cheap jack .
tr	3	A huge painting with a ship on a storm sea time , took over my attention .
tr	2	" Unfortunately yes , I would ... I have a lot of work to do . "
tr	2	I knew too much Damian for him to have friends , and to go out with them .
tr	3	" Damian is not ... " " Why aren 't you telling me the truth ? "
tr	3	On the other hand , I was smiling honestly , waiting for her to tell me the truth .
tr	0	A young man , with blond long hair ... I dreamt a very beautiful mansion , Mrs. Kate .
tr	1	I was too in shock , and from her serious voice , I realized it was like that .
tr	3	" It really doesn 't matter , if he is the Damian I know or not .
tr	2	I took a seat on one of these chairs , and next to me , Mrs. Jones took one .
tr	1	He was very thin , with dark circles around his eyes and his skin was pale .
tr	4	He said , scaring me much more then before , and I dried fast my tears .
tr	0	Damian came fast back in the room , being happy , carrying a piece of paper .
tr	0	It was a large , heavy book , so it made a nice , loud thwack .
tr	3	" But it 's high time for you to have your supper and get to bed . "
tr	1	Upstairs , Miriam found her nightgown was laid out on a chair in front of the fire .
tr	0	One was rather tall with blond hair that curled on his neck and an athlete 's body .
tr	1	" Come in , Virgil , Simon ; why are you both just standing there ? "
tr	3	A tray lined with a white cloth rested on a low table in front of the sofa .
tr	1	" It 's no trouble , sir , " Furnace replied with an inquiring lift of one eyebrow .
tr	2	Theodosia frowned , thought for a moment , and said , " No , nothing else .
tr	1	" Virgil , " she said , " I simply cannot put up with such impertinence from servants .
tr	4	He refilled his glass and sat on the settee where Miriam had been hiding earlier with a contented sigh .
tr	3	" If I might take the liberty , madam ; the two boys will share a room . "
tr	1	" Miss Miriam is in her own bedchamber , down the hall from her father 's room . "
tr	2	Footsteps went past her door -- Simon and Neil had obeyed the order to go their temporary room .
tr	2	Miriam lay on the floor , not realizing that she would have to move to another bedroom soon .
tr	0	She was in front of a pair of dark doors that were scraped and scarred with -- what ?
tr	0	He put his hand on top of hers , and she curled her cold fingers around his warm thumb .
tr	3	The path climbed up the cliff and led into a tunnel that burrowed right through the rock .
tr	3	The lady put it down on the table with the lamp and turned to face Simon .
tr	4	Her silhouetted waist was tiny , and her hair shone like copper in the glow of the lamp .
tr	4	Simon fell on the larger bed where he had slept the night before , overcome with his own wit .
tr	2	Neil got out of bed , trying to look as dignified as one possibly can in pyjamas .
tr	3	I left them here last night -- " " Sent down to the wash , most likely . "
tr	3	" Well , I can 't just take your stuff - " Simon threatened him with another pillow .
tr	3	Look , I think the sea is just down the path at the back of the garden .
tr	1	" I think you 're right -- the sound of the waves is in the direction .
tr	1	A stiff wind blew in their faces , but the sun promised a bright , warm day .
tr	4	Most of them were filled with water and brightly colored creatures like the first pool the boys had explored .
tr	1	" Yes , I always miss that smell when I am at school , " Neil said .
tr	4	It 's as if someone planed down the cliff itself and set those metal discs into the rock . "
tr	2	" Come on , professor , let 's go and find someplace to eat our grub .
tr	1	Simon spread his arms out to the sides and stared stiffly ahead , waiting for something to happen .
tr	0	Simon had already turned away , and he pulled out the large napkin tied around their food .
tr	0	Em , sorry about his , you know , death , and all that , eh ?
tr	4	" No need for scenes ; let 's just make the best of a bad situation , eh ? "
tr	4	They 're a bit scorched , but I think the ones she burned were worthless , really . "
tr	4	We have a great deal to do , Virgil , if we want to get our business project started .
tr	3	He was a stickler for organization and a tight profit , despite his shortcomings in other matters .
tr	1	" A few hours of hunger will calm the girl and bring her around to our side .
tr	1	Can 't you just see her in a ball dress , or a morning gown ? "
tr	2	She continued to turn out the contents of drawers , going through musty closets and opening doors .
tr	2	Inside the room , Theodosia closed the door and stood with her back flat against it .
tr	4	" I could almost believe that she collected the objects before hand and planned the whole attack . "
tr	4	I cannot believe that one child should cause so much difficulty in a large household . "
tr	4	But , " she added , raising one finger , " it will be someone strict .
tr	2	Furnace looked around the room and began to pick up some of the objects from the floor .
tr	1	" Miss Miriam , " he said , " it is becoming very untidy in here .
tr	4	Now she would refuse , go away , and leave him in peace to finish his coffee .
tr	0	He didn 't know why , but somehow he found his hand going to the bell .
tr	1	" Is that Miss , or Mrs. -- oh , look , this is utterly ridiculous .
tr	2	Virgil and Theodosia looked at each other confusedly , and he shook his head as if to clear it .
tr	2	One day , she thought , she would come out of her room , and she would be grown .
tr	2	I 'll -- " " You 'll do nothing of the sort , " a determined voice said .
tr	0	Reaching into a large bag , she took out a packet and broke off a few squares of chocolate .
tr	0	Miriam immediately dashed forward and grabbed at the sweets , but Mana held up her arm .
tr	3	" But I 'm not taking a bath , " she added with her mouth full .
tr	0	Mana turned back to the chest of drawers and began to rummage in another drawer for clean stockings .
tr	0	" You certainly won 't do anything acting the way you have , like a little savage . "
tr	0	Later , a call came from upstairs for hot water , and Theodosia heard the sound of loud splashes .
tr	2	" But I 'm not going to -- " Miriam stopped and looked up at Mana .
tr	2	" If I apologize , is that part of , you know , what you said ?
tr	1	You know , part of studying the wall and finding the weaknesses and strengths , and all that ? "
tr	1	Miriam bunched her hands into fists , and Mana put one hand on the girl 's shoulder .
tr	1	I 'm very sorry for screaming , and for throwing a croquet ball at you , Uncle Virgil . "
tr	4	" You have been acting like a little savage ; I have never seen the like !
tr	0	You haven 't changed a bit , and you obviously need to go back on bread and water . "
tr	2	" I wouldn 't apologize to you if you were the last people in the world ! "
tr	4	Miriam opened her mouth , shut it , and said , " Please forgive my behavior just now . "
tr	1	" Goodnight , Uncle Virgil and Aunt Theodosia , " Miriam said , not paying attention .
tr	0	" That 's about as rude a statement as I ever heard , " Mana said calmly .
tr	2	You 'll need a good school uniform , and the state of your undergarments is ridiculous . "
tr	2	Except it won 't be my room any more , she thought , not after tomorrow .
tr	0	She had to keep a journal , as well as work on mathematics , Latin and history .
tr	4	Miriam flew downstairs , but when she returned , out of breath , Mana held out a sketchbook .
tr	2	" That should be acceptable , as long as you both keep out of Simon 's room . "
tr	2	" And you 'll be on your best behavior if you do encounter him , miss ! "
tr	2	In the schoolroom , Mana ignored Miriam 's protests and opened a book of poetry in front of her .
tr	0	Mana picked up a darning egg and looked at Miriam over the rim of her glasses .
tr	3	It is the way to the servants ' quarters , and now -- to our rooms as well .
tr	4	She had expected the attic room to be dreary , but it was painted white inside .
tr	2	There was a long , low bookshelf on one side that Mana had filled with Miriam 's favorite books .
tr	4	Far below , beyond the house gardens , a deep , wide furrow plowed through the thick woods .
tr	0	Nelly carefully measured a square of greased paper against a pan and cut it to fit the bottom .
tr	3	" You 'll just have to do it later , that 's all ; after dinner probably . "
tr	1	Miriam looked up and grinned , and confidently tucked her hand in the crook of Mana 's elbow .
tr	0	Theodosia opened her mouth , shut it again , and wished that tea had already finished .
tr	0	" Sit down , Miriam , and take the tea your guardian is handing to you . "
tr	1	" Yes , she is , " Miriam said , " and she 's my governess .
tr	2	" No one wants to listen to the schedule of your lessons , " Theodosia said .
tr	1	" Mana , " she complained , " I 'm right in the middle of writing a story !
tr	3	" Don 't saw the top of your egg with a knife ; it 's vulgar .
tr	3	" But you 'll have it by heart shortly , " she continued and cut off Miriam 's protests .
tr	2	And when you 're finished , you may go off on your own for a bit .
tr	1	She listened while Miriam said her lines , nodding with approval and prompting her once or twice .
tr	0	Out in the hall , he heard his mother 's voice as she called for him .
tr	2	I just want to do some of my prep without my mother looking over my shoulder . "
tr	3	" I should have known better than to try and talk to a little idiot . "
tr	0	And you , " she added to Miriam , " you are -- you are -- ! "
tr	1	Finally , the girl crossed her arms over her chest and muttered , " Sorry . "
tr	4	" He sharpened my pencil too much , " Miriam explained , holding the offending object up .
tr	2	You have a good imagination ; just picture the teacher that your Aunt Theodosia would hire for you . "
tr	0	" I 'll do the lines , and I won 't pull faces at Aunt Theodosia anymore . "
tr	3	" Pearson 's attorney , Fortescue , says the will is quite clear on that point .
tr	2	No , we can 't lose our own money ; it 's taking bread out of our own mouths !
tr	4	By the time she came back , Miriam was hopping from one foot to the other with suppressed excitement .
tr	1	" It must be the wind , " Mana said , giving her a quick prod .
tr	4	A branch snapped and the leaves rustled , followed by a muffled , " Shhhh ! "
tr	0	" Hello , " Mana propped her umbrella in the ground and leaned on it at a dashing angle .
tr	0	Mana shouldered the umbrella like a soldier at a march and strode off towards the cliffs .
tr	4	They could just see two faint white smudges on the horizon , one smaller than the other .
tr	3	" That 's from that song you sang to me , the first night you came here ! "
tr	2	" Now , why don 't the three of you go and look for specimens ? "
tr	0	She produced two nets and a couple of jam jars , and handed them to Simon and Miriam .
tr	0	Mana called , and they headed back with their prizes to where a picnic was laid out .
tr	1	I think Cook gave us potted shrimps and Scotch eggs , as well as sausage and cress sandwiches . "
tr	1	She squinted at the prawn and poured him out into the pool in a flurry of legs and antennae .
tr	4	They weren 't glowing , or humming , and the rock wall hadn 't altered in the least .
tr	4	" There has to be some kind of apparatus somewhere that controls them , " Neil mused .
tr	3	" Well , we 'll just have to get to the bottom of it , " Miriam responded .
tr	3	She handed it to Mrs. Williams , who took it and sat at the large wooden table .
tr	3	" And she says that I 'm to rearrange but not move any of the contents .
tr	2	Miriam 's clothes , all spotlessly clean and ironed , hung from hooks in a neat row .
tr	3	The thing still whirred , and she pushed several other keys to try and get it to stop .
tr	1	She rapidly braided Miriam 's mane , twisting the strands into an intricate pattern behind the girl 's head .
tr	0	" My last company wasn 't nearly as good as this one , " Mr. Cantwell replied .
tr	4	On the settee , unseen by his parents , Simon rolled his eyes and held his nose .
tr	3	Miriam wanted to retort that she had been spoken to , but that might have reflected back on Mana .
tr	4	On the whole , it was easier to sit and be quiet and hope to be ignored .
tr	2	They would expound on the poor fool who won her heart too , she was certain .
tr	0	With a start , she realized that Mr. Cantwell had spoken to her and was waiting for her answer .
tr	4	She got to her feet and turned for the door , realizing that Mr. Cantwell had risen with her .
tr	4	Miriam leaned her cheek on one hand as she considered her paper and Mana 's suggestions .
tr	3	" Be careful of that one , " Mana said softly , pointing to the new partner .
tr	1	" Your uncle is easy to follow , as he takes things for granted and makes many assumptions .
tr	3	Still , it is interesting that Mr. Cantwell left your uncle behind in the woods . "
tr	0	" But what is -- " Mana shushed her again and drew Miriam 's original essay towards her .
tr	2	" Eat your bread , and you may work on your story for a bit . "
tr	3	At tea that afternoon , Miriam continued the tactic of being polite and as quiet as possible .
tr	1	" I am such an idiot about directions , " he said , throwing a melting look at Theodosia .
tr	1	" Of course , dear fellow , " Virgil said , sloshing liquid into his own glass .
tr	3	Clues to what , she wasn 't certain , but she was certain that she 'd find something .
tr	3	" Um , that is -- it might be a good idea to knock first . "
tr	2	" Now , why is it that you want to visit a schoolroom during your holidays ? "
tr	2	You 're a fellow student at Simon 's school , aren 't you , Neil ? "
tr	2	" You know , the story about the dragonfly warrior and the wasp 's chessboard . "
tr	4	With a glance at Miriam , Neil stood , mumbled goodbye , and they left the room .
tr	0	" I 'm going to get a book from the library , " Miriam told Mana casually .
tr	2	It was full of blank writing paper , gummed labels , lumps of sealing wax and pencils .
tr	1	She hunted around on the desk and in the open drawer , but could find nothing .
tr	3	I won 't tell on you ; I just want to see what it is . "
tr	1	Chapter 16 Barbara his is my sister , " Mr. Cantwell said , drawing the stranger forward .
tr	1	" Think on it , in any case , " Virgil said , emptying his glass down his throat .
tr	4	As they moved outdoors , Miriam maneuvered her way to Neil 's side and whispered , " Neil !
tr	1	" I don 't know if I should , " he said , his ears turning pink .
tr	3	He continued , " Although , it won 't do any good if it 's like the last time .
tr	1	You 've finally lost it , " Neil said , disengaging himself as rapidly as possible .
tr	0	" And we 've always got to go and visit them , with a large picnic ! "
tr	0	" Yes , that is my name , and a heavy burden it has always been to me . "
tr	0	" Well , if you want us to stay ... " Barbara trailed off meaningfully , smiling at Simon .
tr	2	" I suppose we could manage it , don 't you , Valiant , my love ?
tr	4	Simon hung over her shoulder , holding a few sheets of music as she settled herself on the stool .
tr	3	Miriam stiffened as Mr. Cantwell sat next to her , putting one arm along the back of the sofa .
tr	0	At the piano , Simon was scowling again , and Barbara 's delicate eyebrows were raised .
tr	3	And , I regret to add that it is time for Miriam to go to bed . "
tr	4	I 'm always afraid I 'll knock off the handle whenever I have to use one . "
tr	1	" Miriam , " she asked , " did you drink from this cup at all ? "
tr	3	" I think I 'll write to my parents and tell them that I 'll come home soon . "
tr	2	" But you could , you know , cloud their minds while we looked , " Miriam argued .
tr	0	Miriam , watching him , realized that Neil found Mana just as attractive as Simon found Miss Cantwell .
tr	0	" Well , that 's what Barb -- my parents said , and Mr. Cantwell agreed . "
tr	2	" But Neil and he will have left , and I 'll have no one to talk to ! "
tr	0	At that , Barbara turned away suddenly with a swish of silk skirts and was gone .
tr	4	Mana stood still for a long moment , and she opened the drawer of Miriam 's bedside table .
tr	0	" By all means , " he said , striding forward and grasping the delicate thing .
tr	2	She came very close to him , but didn 't move to pass through the doorway .
tr	2	" Miss Cantwell , I 'll have you know I only have one more year of school ! "
tr	3	" I don 't know , " he said , " I never really thought about it . "
tr	4	Of course , there will be some difficult things we will all have to do before . "
tr	2	Still , if we -- if you -- do them well , you shall have your real reward . "
tr	3	No one noticed , however , thanks to Barbara 's bright chatter and constant stream of conversation .
tr	0	" Well , one can hardly be happy about having a native in the house , " Theodosia said .
tr	1	" I 'll do it , " Valiant offered , putting his cigar in a silver holder .
tr	0	" Wonder if she has any middle names -- Gaga or Lala or whatever it is ? "
tr	2	Words failed Theodosia for a moment , and she moved her mouth , looking rather like a fish .
tr	2	" Go on , " Theodosia said to Mana , " show it to her at once ! "
tr	2	Barbara will promise to only look at it and not touch , won 't you , Barbara ? "
tr	0	" Now , now , careful , Miriam , " he said pleasantly as she tore at him .
tr	1	The door closed with finality , and Miriam sobbed as she heard Mana 's swift steps going upstairs .
tr	4	" I suppose I shall have to supervise her departure , " Theodosia said , heading for the door .
tr	3	" See that the girl stays here ; I want no further contact between her and that woman . "
tr	1	" Done Theo , " Valiant said , effortlessly picking Miriam up and putting her in a chair .
tr	1	" Hey , " Simon said , coming behind Valentine and tapping him on the arm .
tr	3	She put it under her pillow and got into her nightgown , letting her clothes slip to the floor .
tr	3	Furthermore , and most frustrating , Miss Cantwell had called her ' the little girl ' .
tr	0	She was always able to fall asleep right away since Mana came to be her governess .
tr	4	The house was dark and silent , and all the doors in the hallways were closed .
tr	4	The light came from the little lamp on the desk , shining down on two pieces of paper .
tr	1	Still , it was exhilarating riding down the lane , the tall bushes rushing by on either side .
tr	3	" I wouldn 't mind a biscuit -- that is what you 've got , isn 't it ? "
tr	4	A very long time seemed to pass , and he fell into a kind of doze .
tr	3	The voice at the station had said something about " nippers " being on the train .
tr	4	It now seemed to be composed of lumpy cobblestones , and Neil was bounced about uncomfortably as they descended .
tr	2	Neil moved into a more comfortable position , expecting to hear a cry from Poole , but nothing happened .
tr	3	Still , they made progress , and the boat slowly faded away into the mist that had sprung up .
tr	1	" In case you hadn 't noticed , we seem to be rushing along in a train .
tr	3	" My point is that we 're not free , and it 's ridiculous to say so . "
tr	1	" Well , at least I can scratch my nose now , " Miriam said , itching violently .
tr	3	She picked up the typing machine and looked at it , turning it this way and that .
tr	2	Breaking into a run , she dashed out of the room , shouting , " Virgil !
tr	4	Sin number one : stealing a boat , the worst crime possible for the son of a fisherman .
tr	2	A yellow haze moved over the sun , in front of an ominous pack of dark clouds .
tr	0	They both liked mechanics and mathematics , although Simon was also a fast runner and a bruising rider .
tr	3	He felt for the collecting bottle and realized that he must have lost it in the storm .
tr	0	Neil rolled into the sea and sank , arms and legs waving in a desperate attempt to stay afloat .
tr	3	He wanted to spit the stuff out , but he had no energy to sit up or move .
tr	0	He managed to push himself up on one arm , but he simply couldn 't hold his head up .
tr	0	The only thing he had in mind was to push his way towards the hidden river .
tr	2	He took a long swallow of the orange drink , which was cold , sweet , and delicious .
tr	2	" Come with me , and I 'll show you to a room where you can sleep . "
tr	4	For a moment , he lay with his eyes closed and a smile on his face .
tr	2	The long , smooth muscles in her arms worked as she began to rock it back and forth .
tr	4	A tall , bearded man entered , followed by two others that looked like younger copies of the first .
tr	1	Her father turned and considered Neil for a moment , looking at him with an unblinking stare .
tr	1	You shouldn 't take in strangers just because Riki has found them ; this boy could be dangerous . "
tr	2	And I assure you that I mean no harm to you or to your family . "
tr	1	" I think I 'll change my name , " Riki complained , but she subsided .
tr	0	Can 't we all at least sit down and eat , and talk like human beings ? "
tr	1	It was filled with what looked like huge shrimp , coated with spices and bursting out of their shells .
tr	1	he wondered , considering her skinny wrists , which looked like twigs poking out of her turquoise tunic .
tr	4	She became aware of his gaze and blurted out , " You 're not eating anything . "
tr	2	She came back to the table and demanded , " How did you do that ? "
tr	4	" Well , I 'm terribly sorry -- " Neil began to rise from the table .
tr	1	First , I haven 't any money , and second , I 'm not a thief .
tr	3	Like a puppy that has picked up a new scent to follow , Riki forgot all about the market .
tr	2	Instantly , the door to the dining room opened , and one of the brothers ' heads popped out .
tr	0	" I , er , actually I planned to take a walk around the island with Riki today . "
tr	4	Maybe he had committed a grave breach of etiquette with his offer to take Riki out for the day .
tr	1	" I trust you will forgive my behavior last night ; it has been a somewhat tiring week . "
tr	1	" Mr. Neil proposes to view the island today , with Riki as his guide . "
tr	0	After all , Simon and Miriam could be up against something much worse at that very minute .
tr	3	" To think that someone who talked to Mr. Pearson 's daughter is actually at our table ! "
tr	3	Neil had , at least , won the argument over the amount of gear that they should carry .
tr	3	It led to a little path that headed towards the seashore , from the sound of the waves .
tr	2	" I owe too much to your parents to have you stay out all night and worry them .
tr	1	" Riki , " he said , " I will tell you when I 'm ready .
tr	4	Riki watched him closely and did the same , and they dunked their ropes into the pool .
tr	1	" Wouldn 't it be perfect to live like this , swimming and catching crabs and fish all day ?
tr	4	He was sick for a long time , and the new ruler should have been his daughter . "
tr	0	The man watched them as they followed the path into the trees , his hands on his hips .
tr	2	" Come on ; I want to move on before that guard finds us again . "
tr	2	Neil looked at her with dislike and hoisted the basket of food back onto his shoulder .
tr	3	From the little he had heard about the man , it seemed totally out of character .
tr	3	Riki subjected to her mother 's hug and plopped onto her bottom in the grass , sighing dramatically .
tr	0	" I 'm afraid I managed to take a longer route than I should have done . "
tr	2	We could lose our home , or even our -- oh , please do not mention it again . "
tr	2	" No , " he said mournfully , " I really must do what I can for Simon .
tr	0	he sobbed , and he tried to catch her , to hold her in his arms .
tr	4	The crabs had been caught by Neil and Riki , who had returned to the sea the following day .
tr	1	Or Riki invariably popped up in his path and demanded that he take her fishing or hunting .
tr	2	No , no bloody fear , Neil swore as he got up and made for the stairs .
tr	3	He lifted one fist and was about to start to bang and shout out a long stream of abuse .
tr	0	" You obviously can 't do anything at all by yourself , " she said in a calm voice .
tr	2	" You need someone to help you , and it looks like I 'm all you 've got . "
tr	2	" But -- " " And you really do need to help your friends , don 't you ? "
tr	0	The large man put the tray on a box and knelt by a heap of blankets .
tr	4	" I can 't allow you to leave , but I can 't move her in either .
tr	3	He stumbled to his room , trying not to picture the pile of rubbish that she would assemble .
tr	4	He slept the entire afternoon , so he didn 't have time to talk to Riki before dinner .
tr	1	" Mr. Neil , I 'm sure , would like to make up his own mind .
tr	4	Across the table , he saw that Riki 's eyes were closing of their own accord .
tr	1	There was a light tap on his door , and Riki whispered , " Neil ! "
tr	3	It was that huge guard , the one with the nasty knife on the end of his stick .
tr	3	Riki immediately darted to the path and began to climb , leaving some muddy footprints in the dust .
tr	0	Holding it to the wooden brand serving as their torch , he saw that his hands were shaking .
tr	3	" Snakes don 't wail like that , nor at all , at least not in my country .
tr	4	They were so close that if Neil had taken another step he would have gone over the side .
tr	4	The dark passage stopped abruptly at the cliff and ended in the precarious ledge they stood on .
tr	4	Handing the torch to Riki , he got down on his stomach and peered over the ledge .
tr	3	He grinned , feeling as though the world had just started to tip back to reality .
tr	4	" I 'm Neil 's best friend , and we 'll probably get married some day .
tr	1	Riki , in front of him , climbed down the stairs easily , humming to herself .
tr	0	He was afraid that , as tired as he was , he would fall and break his leg .
tr	0	The cook baked fish cakes , too , and pounded plantains into small patties that were fried and salted .
tr	0	Suppose we go past the palace that way and run into more of those guards ? "
tr	4	We decided to leave early ; that is , we wanted to get away before anyone was up .
tr	2	We are housing one of those dangerous lunatics now , and it is all due to him . "
tr	4	He wouldn 't even be able to argue that they should let him stay in their house .
tr	4	Still , he couldn 't have allowed the girl to lie outside in the heat and flies .
tr	2	Will you forget our verbal attack on your person , and let us welcome you anew to our home ?
tr	1	I left my school , and I jeopardized my scholarship , " Neil said in quiet desperation .
tr	2	I have probably lost my only chance to ever attend school and help support my family .
tr	4	" Well , still , I am very surprised that you haven 't planned your dress .
tr	2	Neil hid a grin and thought , Yes , and you 'll look just like a bloated caterpillar .
tr	3	" I thought that the Palace would be too busy with the preparations to notice our little expedition . "
tr	1	" Neil and I can come up and keep watch in the tunnel for you ! "
tr	1	" Neil , you may come if you don 't mind facing a guard in the tunnel . "
tr	4	And be careful , everyone , we don 't want to go over that cliff . "
tr	3	" I just don 't want to put your sons in danger , " Neil muttered .
tr	3	" Father , what if I climbed down the chain and got the princess out that way ? "
tr	0	And you must bear in mind that is must also carry the cage and the princess . "
tr	4	She never moved , and the whites of her eyes showed beneath her lids in an unsettling way .
tr	1	That means she is close to consciousness , and not lost to us in the lands of dreams .
tr	3	I had better get my wits about me ; today will certainly be a long day . "
tr	4	She caught her father 's eye , remembered her promise to be good , and nodded .
tr	1	He was in the round bed in his sumptuous room , the sheets twisted around his legs .
tr	3	Neil sat and panted for a moment , waiting for his heart rate to return to normal .
tr	4	He ate quickly , and , feeling much better , sat down on the edge of the long settee .
tr	4	He gestured towards the kitchen and the back garden , and she shook her head slightly .
tr	4	" Very well , ' he said , " but turn around while I dress . "
tr	1	" It 's just not seemly , " Neil said with as much dignity as he could muster .
tr	0	A dark figure was bent over Mana , holding a shuttered lantern that cast long shadows around the hut .
tr	0	It was the same move he had pulled on Miriam at dinner , about a thousand years ago now .
tr	4	In the center was the reflecting pool , a huge basin of black stone with benches surrounding it .
tr	2	" Oh , you 're supposed to look in it , and reflect -- get it ? "
tr	1	" You were probably too busy trying to fish or swim in it , " Neil said .
tr	0	I can 't wait to go back and write up our plans , " she said .
tr	4	The priest walked away , waving out the match flame , and his footsteps echoed in the underground silence .
tr	1	She looked thinner , and older , and she sat on a cot in a prison cell .
tr	1	" As you wish , " he replied , speaking with a slight accent but using perfect diction .
tr	2	You may have fooled the other guards , but you cannot do so with me . "
tr	1	Surely you see that by allowing this thing I am giving up my family 's privacy ! "
tr	1	He is selling his subjects as human experiments , and no one is doing anything about it .
tr	4	Not heeding the huge , armed men in her path , she dashed out of the room .
tr	1	I wonder that her maid didn 't warn her to wear a more fortunate color for her complexion .
tr	3	The boats drew up to a long flight of marble stairs that descended right down into the water .
tr	2	Most vexatious ; I was just about to ask more about our fortune and your promotion . "
tr	0	Holding out his arm , he rubbed it with his other hand for a few moments .
tr	4	He turned suddenly to the guests , who were frozen in attitudes of shock and fascination .
tr	0	Machi was approaching Mana with his spear in his hand , his teeth bared in a snarl .
tr	4	The guards who had been guarding the king clustered behind Machi in order to defend him .
tr	0	Stabbing the air with an imaginary weapon , she ran after Mana and the tall guard .
tr	2	The library was a large room lined with windows on the wall that overlooked the lagoon .
tr	0	Neil and Riki sat down , a little way from the main table , and she nudged him again .
tr	1	" See , Papi ; I always have to remind you , " Riki countered with spirit .
tr	0	" I find that a small group in delicate situations is better than a large army .
tr	2	We will not get that job done if we allow false modesty and good manners to sway our judgment .
tr	2	And you 're not as effective without me , nor am I any good without you .
tr	1	But the first order of business is to reassure your parents that you are still alive . "
tr	1	Mana got up and put one hand under his chin , tilting it up so his eyes met hers .
tr	0	On the Night Watchman Express he Night Watchman train swayed and chugged along through the countryside .
tr	2	Since they sat on a floor made of dimpled iron , this was next to impossible .
tr	0	Miriam glanced at Simon triumphantly , as if she had just scored a point against him .
tr	4	In fact , there were some large stains in one corner that looked like dried blood .
tr	4	In between musings , he had fallen asleep and banged his own head on the side .
tr	4	He shifted and experimentally tilted his head against hers so that they leaned against each other .
tr	0	He looked at Miriam again and asked , " And who might you two be ? "
tr	0	" Saying goodbye to fancy balls and servants , " Blue Eyes said with a last chuckle .
tr	3	Frank opened his mouth to retort , but the train rounded a turn and began to slow down .
tr	2	" Soon you 'll be able to talk to someone in charge , as you keep saying . "
tr	2	" After all , you 've got connections in high places , don 't you , young muck ?
tr	4	We 'll be home in time for tea , just like I 've said all along . "
tr	2	The conductors prodded the chained prisoners and pushed Simon and Miriam , and they all shuffled towards the figure .
tr	0	One of the doors opened , and a man , as tall and thin as the Headmistress appeared .
tr	2	" I saw what your goons do to us if we don 't obey you . "
tr	2	Miriam followed her through the door in the opposite wall , still hoping to break through .
tr	2	A woman in the corner shook out Miriam 's pinafore and pulled out Mana 's wooden comb .
tr	1	I 'll hide it , and I won 't let the Headmistress find it , I promise . "
tr	2	There was a cot in one corner of the room , and Miriam plopped onto it .
tr	0	It was a woman in a white , starched dress , with a white cap on her head .
tr	3	The woman in the white uniform brought a tray to his bed and put it on the round table .
tr	3	" Not too quickly , there , that 's it -- " The soup was hot and delicious .
tr	1	After he had swallowed , she said , " No use getting into a fuss , is it ?
tr	0	Shaking his head as if that would help to clear his memory , he looked around .
tr	1	" Oh dear , standing isn 't a very good idea , now , is it ? "
tr	2	Silently blessing the person who had furnished the room , Simon put it on and tiptoed to the door .
tr	0	The valley was long and narrow and as beautiful a place as he had ever seen .
tr	3	He could feel the warmth of the morning light starting to take the chill from his bungalow .
tr	1	It is unheard of and in light of my sighting evil seems to be afoot . "
tr	0	Dreams of adventure and danger were as foreign to him as was soaring among the birds .
tr	3	That in and of itself was very strange as it was rare throughout their history that anyone traveled .
tr	0	Folk thought him queer enough to leave him alone and that was just fine with him .
tr	3	It was a cozy cottage , not brightly lit but glowing brightly from a small fire in the hearth .
tr	0	" A few months ago , I was down in the Dream Valley and I happened across a man .
tr	4	" Men are not like us , yet in many ways we are quite the same .
tr	1	I would like to visit you again and talk , if you would not mind . "
tr	0	He heard a familiar whistle coming from across the path , a shrill tune that carried across the fields .
tr	4	The room was the same as before except for two extra chairs nestled around the fireplace .
tr	0	It appeared to be of the same strange wood from which Mr. Clancy 's chair was fashioned .
tr	1	It is starting to cool down this evening and you gentlemen have had a long walk .
tr	4	" Supper is a few minutes off and I promise you a fine feast for your troubles . "
tr	3	Clancy bid them to sit by the fire as he quickly went about setting the table .
tr	3	They took their seats with Mr. Clancy at the head of the small , square table .
tr	0	His friend had always been a voracious eater but this was a new sight to behold .
tr	4	These plants were dried and crushed and used to flavor many of the meats , stews and soups .
tr	4	There was a sudden knock at the door and they looked up , away from the fire .
tr	0	No hat covered his long reddish-brown hair , thick and curly as it fell to his shoulders .
tr	0	He was wrapped in a thick cape that swung easily and flowed as he walked into the room .
tr	2	" My young friends , I would like you to meet an old companion of mine .
tr	0	" That is strange sir , for I have only known Mr. Clancy for a few days . "
tr	0	" That may be but Clancy knows much more about you than you may realize . "
tr	4	Their conversation flew back and forth between the supper they had eaten and the stranger they had just met .
tr	4	Mr. Clancy rose and moved toward the hearth , stooped and threw another log on the fire .
tr	0	Clancy rose from his chair and walked across the room toward a small cupboard high above the cutting board .
tr	4	Then , as best as he could remember , the fruit was stirred and what it was mixed with .
tr	4	There is one particular bird in each generation that is singled out to be the king 's messenger .
tr	1	" Kingdoms of snow , Northern Kingdoms , birds that speak ; this is all very confusing . "
tr	3	Their spirits return to the north and keep a constant vigil for the return of their quest . "
tr	2	" It is a staff fashioned untold ages ago from one of the oldest trees known in my lands .
tr	2	" You search for it , you know where it is , yet you do not .
tr	1	" I do indeed search for it , yet I may only guess at its location .
tr	4	The only hope lies in the recovery of the crystal and the uniting of the kingdoms .
tr	2	It will be good to again be on the road even if only for a short time . "
tr	0	Though it was not as elaborate as dinner it was as good as any they could remember .
tr	2	How is it that you may be the only one whose destiny is not your own ? "
tr	3	It was easy to move through , sparse and coarse and brittle from the winter months .
tr	2	Clancy soon found the dirt path and they moved into the woods , away from prying eyes .
tr	2	It will give the two of you time to scrape some of the mud from your clothing . "
tr	2	They had stayed too long on this small hill and time was now too precious to waste .
tr	0	He had most likely lived through many such as this , nothing new to him it seemed .
tr	2	The foothills of these mountains are not too difficult and should provide us with any cover we need .
tr	4	The walk was hard as they stumbled over the rocks while trying to keep Mr. Clancy upright .
tr	1	Blood was still running fresh and Clancy 's entire side was soaked turning his garment dark red .
tr	3	Twilight grew steadily upon the land and they could not travel with Clancy in this condition .
tr	3	The sun had finished its march to the west and lay softly down behind the mountains .
tr	4	Darkness grew quickly upon the land and the veil of shadow wrapped them within their cave .
tr	3	He let them rage southward , cutting his course west to the foothills , then turned back north .
tr	4	" A little stiff in the limbs , mind you , however my empty stomach feels quite normal . "
tr	3	This little fellow , he thought , could always raise his spirits even at the darkest hour .
tr	0	Each path was discussed , the good and the bad and all had a say in the matter .
tr	1	I again remind you , this is not a quest to which you have been bound .
tr	2	You may return to your land with no shame brought upon yourselves , if that be your desire . "
tr	3	They looked at Mr. Clancy and then at each other and then again to the southern sky .
tr	1	He was overcome as the blood pounded in his temples and his skin was flush with sweat .
tr	2	I have said great words that I would help you and I will honor those words .
tr	3	He had wanted to go at first light but Clancy 's wound had altered those plans .
tr	4	Then , very carefully taking the bandages in his hands pulled them apart where the blood had dried .
tr	3	It will only take a short while for him to get the fullness of his strength back .
tr	3	The healing power of the roots is best among living things , not that of rock and slate .
tr	1	He felt a great rush of air pass across his face and the dust swirled at his feet .
tr	4	It was their land , the most beautiful they had ever known and they were not safe .
tr	0	They moved off into the woods through the night shadows as quietly as a hushed breath .
tr	1	No , he was as the night itself , silent and moving , yet unseen and unheard .
tr	3	The sun would be up in a matter of turns and it would be time for them to begin .
tr	3	They made their way through a trench and started up as this part of the range sloped gently upward .
tr	0	The handle was smoothed as to the grip of a hand , a place for each finger .
tr	0	As they landed , the black creature struck his head against a rock and was gone .
tr	4	There , where those vile creatures stand is the eye , the resting place of the crystal . "
tr	0	Creatures of a kind attacked each other and the sand ran dark with their black blood .
tr	2	Why this has been so I do not know , but it is here now . "
tr	4	We will do ourselves no good if we continue , and I am getting tired . "
tr	1	" If it is a greater power than that , our mission is in grave danger indeed . "
tr	0	" I will make my way as best as I can back to the land of snow . "
tr	4	You will have time to warn your people and make what preparations you may for its defense . "
tr	1	We will share your road in this quest which has woven us deep within it . "
tr	4	" There may yet be perils on this road that may be beyond my own scope of knowledge . "
tr	3	This was the first time in days he had a chance to just stop and think .
tr	3	It was an irregular shape , slightly curved at the top with flat planes that glistened in the starlight .
tr	3	Then just as quickly as it had begun , the light withdrew back into the stone .
tr	2	" He knows for he has looked into the light and it has spoken to his soul .
tr	1	I am sorry , old friend , but it is beyond my skills to explain further . "
tr	0	Their enemy could suddenly arise and sweep them away as a hand that swats at a bug .
tr	1	It was as if a horn sounded through the still night airs and announced their presence .
tr	1	As I was walking , I pulled out my knife ; I do not know why .
tr	3	It would be some time yet for that but the growing light would now be their greatest threat .
tr	0	" Do you think he has a magic potion that will cure me as well ? "
tr	0	It would be as good a place as any to rest and it was a place they could defend .
tr	3	" It could have a tie to that , but I am not learned in its lore . "
tr	4	It was strange he thought how he acted the wild one when his friends were in danger .
tr	1	He bent over and on finding a small stone with a quick motion flung it down into the ravine .
tr	0	They moved off the face of the cliff as far back against the rock as they could manage .
tr	0	It is a union we may be able to take advantage of on our journey . "
tr	1	There was no fire lit for it could easily give away their position in the darkness .
tr	1	" I will find them , I promise you that and they will die at my feet . "
tr	0	" They are not as far ahead as I thought and they may have scouts about .
tr	4	" Our peoples will not be able to withstand them and they will be enslaved . "
tr	3	The rest of the night went on without any unusual events , something they greatly appreciated .
tr	2	Yes , it would be a great day though he would probably sleep through most of it .
tr	3	They did not know what to make of the situation their eyes locked on the animal .
tr	0	Be careful it is clean and dry so as not to smoke much , and hurry back . "
tr	0	This wolf was a new turn of events and he wished to hear all that was said .
tr	0	He is a traveling companion and guardian and he belongs to no man nor creature that roams this earth .
tr	4	I myself have never seen him change in the years the quest has been in my charge . "
tr	1	If it is within his power he shall let no harm befall any member of this company .
tr	2	" We know the source of this information but how does it affect our previous plans ? "
tr	4	The only way to help our own is to help fulfill the quest of the Searcher . "
tr	3	If this is something we may accomplish with the least amount of danger , so much the better . "
tr	0	The sun was now beginning to climb above the peaks as they had marched long through the night .
tr	3	He wanted to see what was going on around them and he could not accomplish this at night .
tr	4	It was now time to scout the land with a hawk 's eye and determine their next move .
tr	1	You should scout the fields near the hills and the inner pass just inside the first line of mountains .
tr	0	They made camp and ate a brief meal , a cold lunch of fruit and bread .
tr	3	* * * " Out of my way , maggot , I have important duties to tend to . "
tr	1	If you think this task is too difficult for your feeble minds you will be replaced .
tr	4	The building as well was tattered and torn as if it had been in disrepair for uncounted years .
tr	2	He took one more look over the fields and rose lifting his foot over the low brambles .
tr	2	They looked forlornly at him each knowing this could , or soon would happen to all of their homes .
tr	4	These were the forces against which he struggled that his home and his peoples would remain free .
tr	4	Wrapped in that sack are things I believe you will find useful to us on our journey . "
tr	3	That was a long time ago and he had forgotten about them until just minutes before .
tr	3	They made their way to the door and out onto the porch into the brightening day .
tr	4	They would travel as far as they could to see what was left of their homeland .
tr	4	The stop though brief was well needed as their spirits lifted enough to bring their heads up .
tr	0	He reached down and withdrew the long black cloth that held the swords of the four kingdoms .
tr	3	" It is obvious even to me that this is the sword of the Northern Kingdom .
tr	2	I have chosen it out of respect for you and all that you have done for us . "
tr	0	" They are an invading army , and this is what such an army will do . "
tr	3	" It is simple , so simple it is most often the first to be forgotten .
tr	3	" It shall be in fine company that I make my first journey to its feet . "
tr	2	" On the fringe of the woodland and the very small slopes of the foothills . "
tr	2	" The next words you speak may cost you your life , you pitiful fool . "
tr	3	The white spirit that traveled the hills at night had more than taken its share of his troops .
tr	0	So he had to sacrifice a few more ; he had to find that which eluded him .
tr	4	It had been days since their talk had not centered on their journey and the path ahead .
tr	4	If they were truly in danger he was sure the white one would most certainly be standing guard .
tr	4	After you have been announced a second time you will be escorted before the king and his advisors .
tr	4	There , before you may speak you will be asked whatever questions His Majesty sees fit .
tr	2	" What would they ask of you if they did not know why you have come ? "
tr	0	It would be a big day ahead of them and a challenge to their physical limits .
tr	4	" Of course we are ; we are a thousand feet up a damn mountain on a ledge . "
tr	4	Clancy rose to his feet greeting his friend , eager to hear any news he could bring .
tr	3	It was my good fortune in the first battle that I caught it unaware of my presence .
tr	4	I will know by sunset their course , or if they have turned away from the peaks . "
tr	4	They struggled to keep their heads high while trying to do the same for their spirits .
tr	2	I would not like to lose you now , especially to that drop off to your left . "
tr	0	" Well , I guess it wasn 't much of an evening for a watch anyway . "
tr	2	This is work for ones younger than himself he thought , traipsing around in the woods like a fool .
tr	0	If all went as planned it would be a day 's journey at a pace much less demanding .
tr	4	We are hunted by black creatures and we know not where they will travel to find us . "
tr	4	For most of the early miles they stayed to the grassy areas of the fold often walking three abreast .
tr	4	They thought it would be impolite to ask such questions in his presence and they wanted to learn more .
tr	4	He is a man of the world and the most skilled woodsman I have ever run across . "
tr	4	Mr. Clancy 's answer was the correct one , though his tone did not come forth as sincere .
tr	3	It was half a turn perhaps when Clancy thought it was time for them to move on .
tr	4	At least Clancy would and he would be forced to tell them what he had seen .
tr	3	Clancy was not just an exception ; the others had more than proven themselves to this point .
tr	0	After all , he was nothing more than a hawk in the sky and was no threat to them .
tr	0	He choked through the pain , each cough a stabbing reminder his body was not well .
tr	2	Someone or something had put him here , covering his body so as not to be spotted .
tr	0	He reached to take the cover away and fell back as a searing pain clawed at his side .
tr	0	Realizing his condition and unable to do much about it , he lay back again and went to sleep .
tr	3	Day had not fully come to the mountains ; the new light only now beating back the night airs .
tr	1	Still , enough morning light broke through to reveal the gaping wound in his right side .
tr	1	The effort to clear away his prison and examine his wound again stripped him of his strength .
tr	0	That which had held him prisoner was now probably the only thing that kept him alive .
tr	1	He could see nothing save one , lone figure standing in the dim , morning light .
tr	1	They were now in dangerous lands and could ill afford any encounter with the black troops .
tr	0	He was the one now exhausted from his long run through the mountains the previous night .
tr	0	Thoughts of evil ran through their minds as the sun began to sink away across the mountain highlands .
tr	2	It was time for them to look for a place to burrow in for the night .
tr	3	His strength was sapped and the coat of the wolf was red from the digging talons .
tr	4	They rambled ahead feeling their way forward , touching most every tree and limb , often stumbling awkwardly .
tr	3	" I was starting to penetrate the glow of the light when my mind was thrown back .
tr	2	It would be a long and sleepless night , and that , if all went well .
tr	4	He hit and rolled and sprang to his feet , the sword of the Rim Kingdom unsheathed for battle .
tr	1	He continued to his left , swirling in a circle with his back to the tree .
tr	4	The metal clashed and the black ooze ran down his arm as the head fell to the dirt .
tr	3	Suddenly both lost their footing falling down a steep but small slope , their bodies hitting the ground hard .
tr	0	His head hit hard and he saw the stars had come down from the night sky .
tr	0	He also saw something else , a blur , a large shape that had passed him in the darkness .
tr	0	" I am certain these are not all your lands , though I will give you an answer .
tr	2	The journey he would take would be a long one for us though not as long for him .
tr	4	The wounds of the Searcher must be grave indeed if this is the course he has chosen . "
tr	4	From this time forward , I shall take the place of the Searcher until he is well . "
tr	4	The radicals replace him with a master imposter and order the execution of the dead king 's twin brother .
tr	0	His second novel , Duty , asks what might have happened if Napoleon had won at Waterloo .
tr	1	In this story , a mother offers her son to Napoleon 's armies with disastrous consequences .
tr	2	Logan looked up from gazing at the onrushing plains out the smudged glass of the train .
tr	0	The French king had seized control of the paper , and the publication was slandered for its blatant propaganda .
tr	1	" The criminal is being held at an undisclosed location and will stand trial this coming Tuesday .
tr	2	Workers and students were out of work , out of bread , and out of patience .
tr	0	I glanced out the window and was again caught by the rolling beauty of my home , England .
tr	4	We had just enough time to hop aboard and take our leave of the porters before she set sail .
tr	0	Droplets coated the air , and passengers sat about , reading their papers and puffing their cigars .
tr	0	As darkness swallowed all aboard , we returned to our cabin for a night of fulfilled rest .
tr	2	Not one collapsed monastery or Roman arch would pass by without an anecdote from my friend .
tr	1	We stared for hours at the works of Renaissance masters and the intricate stone carvings of sculptors long dead .
tr	4	Room after glorious room , each more adorned than the last , filled the entire building .
tr	1	In one corner , peasants labored over their farm , digging rows for planting in the dirt .
tr	2	" You look like you 're Louis XVI and the mob has come for you . "
tr	2	In all our years of friendship , Logan had never once offered any apology for his noble birth .
tr	0	It 's an established tradition , a thousand years in the making , and a good one .
tr	0	And Nathaniel , aside from a fluke , that tradition you 're lauding makes you worthless . "
tr	4	Chapter III We didn 't speak as we entered a small cafe for dinner that night .
tr	1	By this point , our conversation had grown heated , and others were beginning to pay attention .
tr	0	The man clamped a hand upon my wrist , buckling it , and I collapsed back into my seat .
tr	1	" Why don 't you leave , friend , " I spit , using his greeting .
tr	2	My apologies , " I clipped off as I shook the hands of the second and the doctor .
tr	4	He walked to a space between the two combatants and withdrew a grimy handkerchief from his pocket .
tr	0	A shot cracked the air , and my eye snapped towards Logan as a cloud of smoke obscured him .
tr	3	Logan , for his part , threw out his chest , defying the shot about to come .
tr	0	It had been a long day , and now , almost midnight , we lay about chatting .
tr	1	My fingers closed on the glass neck , and I hauled it from its display case .
tr	0	The rock was wrapped with a small slip of paper , a leather strap holding the message in place .
tr	3	We took to the streets to find a carriage to drive us and our luggage to the train depot .
tr	3	The carriage had pulled to a stop in front of the building we 'd just left .
tr	1	In spite of all this , I still felt a bit ridiculous leaving our trunks behind .
tr	3	During our stay in the city , we had seen quite a few patrols to that effect .
tr	4	However , they did manage to keep my mind occupied through the long watch just before dawn .
tr	4	Behind me , I heard the footfalls of several more runners , but I gave them no thought .
tr	0	Whirling about , I saw three men shaking their fists , almost comically , as we made our getaway .
tr	4	" So much for a coincidence , " I whispered , settling into the seat opposite the sleeping man .
tr	2	We shook the proffered hand , offered our own introductions , and took another look at the man .
tr	3	Settling back and letting the locomotive rock us , our new companion tried to answer that very question .
tr	2	Anyone could do those , but it took something special to gain fame in the literary world .
tr	3	The character in the story was not terribly important , but I asked her to elaborate .
tr	3	I told the family our intentions , and nearly all of them clapped with expectant joy !
tr	4	I could feel seething anger , unquenchable rage building within me like an ember prodded into flame .
tr	4	There 's no one left to whisper to my soul in the darkness ... It was cholera .
tr	2	Either of you two could shoot me right now , and I wouldn 't be offended .
tr	1	I cannot find him , much as I 'd like to throw myself into his arms .
tr	0	Chapter VI " Wow , that is quite a tale , " said our American friend later .
tr	1	" No amount of talking will fix this problem , and all this chatter is making me nervous .
tr	4	The Alps , once unconquerable to all but Hannibal and Napoleon , now could be crossed with relative ease .
tr	4	I could almost see the steam billowing from the engine and hear the wheels churning up the slope .
tr	4	We wound ourselves around the peaks and within our compartment , the chill of winter was descending .
tr	0	The Italian countryside was , perhaps , even more beautiful and captivating than the lands of France .
tr	4	Besides , I think someone needs to keep track of you two , given your start in Paris . "
tr	3	" That , and you 'll be wanting to get your whist money back , " Logan quipped .
tr	3	I don 't think many nobles have ; the idea 's pretty radical , isn 't it ?
tr	1	Now , feats of engineering , both ancient and modern , were racing by the compartment window .
tr	3	At last , the train slowed , belching steam in protest , and it slipped into the station .
tr	3	" I think the bullet you put through Fuchs just might have something to do with it all . "
tr	4	We slowed our pace , certain of our success in eluding the men , before I answered .
tr	4	Even here , the Christian capital of Europe , beggars waited in the dirt , misery embodied .
tr	3	So , the first order of business was to meet with Logan 's father 's contacts in the city .
tr	4	To keep out of our pursuers ' hands , we 'd need a line of credit and soon .
tr	1	My fortune was gone with my sunken cargo , and I had nothing , nothing to my name .
tr	2	" So of course I am honored to host the son of a great man and invaluable friend .
tr	2	" You 've heard my name of course , but I do not have the honor of yours . "
tr	4	You are most kind , and any assistance you offer , we won 't refuse . "
tr	2	" If there 's no opposition from the others , we would love to accept . "
tr	0	Shown to our rooms by Sebastian , the valet , we sank into massive armchairs by a small fireplace .
tr	0	We chatted about our change in fortune and let Di Luca 's brandy remove all doubts and cares .
tr	0	Political machinations , bad investments , war , and other factors had led to their downfall .
tr	2	If you would like to take your places amid the hall , it would be most helpful . "
tr	0	As the waltz slowed to a halt , we watched Di Luca direct his dancing partner over towards us .
tr	4	" Now , I see that my wife has collected some fine company for the evening .
tr	0	Drawing Alexandra aside , I begged apology for my ignorance and asked to hear more about her native land .
tr	4	I won 't have you wasting the moment on someone already claimed , however magnificent she may be . "
tr	2	From that first moment , a warm affection for the nameless girl took hold of me .
tr	4	" My lady , you are the most talented dancer I have ever had the pleasure to meet . "
tr	4	They mentioned your dancing prowess , and I can see now that those stories are more than true . "
tr	1	Your niece is a most charming woman , and her dancing is everything you said it would be . "
tr	0	It 's another bit of national pride we maintain , " said Alexandra , patting my arm .
tr	2	We don 't get foreign company often , and I would love to show you my country ! "
tr	4	We stared at each other in disbelief , completely baffled by the Klein 's swift exit .
tr	1	His face curled in on itself ; I laughed inwardly as I realized the man was sulking .
tr	4	Our heels clicked along the corridor outside the great hall as we pushed our way through the throng .
tr	4	By the pensive droop of his eyes , Logan was contemplating the beauty which had only just left us .
tr	3	" I don 't know if I buy that argument , but we 'll leave it for now .
tr	0	Logan and I shrugged , and Jacob rapped the side of the carriage , signaling our chauffeur .
tr	2	We shoot the lock , roll out of the carriage , and run through the darkness .
tr	4	He placed his revolver against the lock , looked at us to gauge our readiness , and fired .
tr	4	The report echoed through the carriage , and the acrid stench of gunpowder settled around us .
tr	2	The ceiling had collapsed long ago , and the floor was devoid of pews or any other religious trappings .
tr	4	Spots of moonlight drifted through the open ceiling , casting a haunting , ethereal mood over the entire place .
tr	4	Three to five odds aren 't as bad as they might be , " whispered Jacob .
tr	2	" Circling around to kill us from the back , no doubt , " said Logan .
tr	0	A man , dressed all in black , was struggling with Logan -- who clutched a bleeding arm .
tr	2	The rogue dropped , his blood seeping into the grooves of the holy stones around us .
tr	2	Cocking my pistol once more , I waited for any other assaults ; none were forthcoming .
tr	4	At one point , our blades became locked together , each man struggling to overpower the other .
tr	1	In a fit of rage and quick thinking , I brought my pistol up and cocked it .
tr	3	Above him , the other man had dismounted , his sword waiting for the slightest opportunity .
tr	2	I wanted to speak , to apologize , or retch -- I didn 't know which .
tr	3	It didn 't matter that we 'd been ambushed by scoundrels with every intention to kill us .
tr	4	The sooner we learn what this cult is , the sooner we 'll have some peace to enjoy . "
tr	0	Calling an attendant , I prepared a bath and readied myself for the day , whatever time it was .
tr	1	I was starting to question if the officer was simple or our skills in the Italian language were flawed .
tr	3	He , and others at the party , indicated that you left long before Di Luca .
tr	1	We didn 't know him long , but he was a wonderful host and new friend . "
tr	4	There 's only one skill in life I wish I hadn 't been forced to learn .
tr	0	He took a sip of brandy ; a train attendant had brought drinks to us awhile back .
tr	1	Shooting is the one skill I had to learn , and I can do it very well . "
tr	2	To back out , I would lose all credibility , and all of my writings would become drivel .
tr	4	The comment hovered in the compartment , neither of us responding for a very long moment .
tr	0	Now though , as I peered through the glass into the dawn , the landscape had changed .
tr	4	I knew that either of these fellows would die defending me , and I felt the same for them .
tr	0	To me , this had always sounded like propaganda to puff up the subject 's ego and reputation .
tr	4	The occasional farmstead and cultivated field dotted the landscape , and we finally began to see people .
tr	1	Concurrently , my other hand shot out , grabbing the man and shoving him to the ground .
tr	3	Trusting the laborers to their work , we left the platform , walking into the city .
tr	4	Dogs , domesticated not wild , circled their masters , begging every passersby to pet them .
tr	1	Welcome to the home of Mister Joseph Klein , Minister of War for His Majesty King Martin III . "
tr	4	Peering inside , I shrugged towards the others and followed the excitable servant into the home .
tr	1	After a while , we passed through a pair of wide , thick doors back into the blinding sun .
tr	4	Then Joseph led the group towards the birch tree and waved each person to a chair .
tr	4	I noted with some amusement that he placed Adele and himself between our group and Mercedes .
tr	0	" You boys have been traveling for hours and probably haven 't had a decent meal today .
tr	0	Finally , my friend related the particulars of our ambush after the ball and Di Luca 's murder .
tr	4	" And so , sir , we 've come here seeking answers at your daughter 's behest .
tr	0	It 's a long story , and very dark in many places ... but I can tell you . "
tr	2	But for now , I want to focus on two things : religion and the monarchy .
tr	2	If you get the chance to look closer , you 'll find it 's more than just a diamond .
tr	2	As a whole , the symbol is a reflection of the social order according to the Faith .
tr	3	We 'll come to that later , but you gentlemen most certainly harmed the Faith that day .
tr	3	I mentioned that the Faith hasn 't taken kindly to Martin 's shift in governing style .
tr	0	His ministers are there to provide assistance and advice , and occasionally attempt to dissuade the king from acting .
tr	0	He cited all manner of legal clauses and longstanding practices to make the taxes appear right .
tr	0	" Taken aback by Fuchs ' taxes , King Martin began examining other parts of the kingdom .
tr	3	For a time , King Martin turned into a raging absolutist ; the Faith should have been proud .
tr	1	He saw Fuchs ' increasing involvement in the Faith as a hobby for the disillusioned , disenfranchised politician .
tr	3	If they could kill Martin and take control , they 'd do it in a heartbeat . "
tr	1	His ambition is limited to reaching the height of expertise in the skills he 's chosen to focus upon .
tr	0	As the man paused to take a sip from his wine , I heard a rustling of grass .
tr	3	For her part , Mercedes was staring at the servant as the man trotted away through the courtyard .
tr	1	They 're killing King Martin , and I won 't be a part of it . "
tr	4	We traveled around to Paris , Luzerne , Bern , other places I don 't remember .
tr	3	Kurt wouldn 't hear my protests though , so I went on a walk through the streets .
tr	1	A lone candle lit up a single window along the second floor in the west wing .
tr	4	Besides , I don 't even know if we can trust her anymore , ' he said .
tr	4	I wondered how long these two had been lovers and how recent the separation had been .
tr	4	Gardens and small groves dotted the space , and everything was circled by a tall metal fence .
tr	2	We 'll sound the alarm , but if it 's false , I look to you for explanations . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry , sir , but the palace is closed as of this moment .
tr	2	Two winding staircases led up to the upper floors , and a long corridor opened before us .
tr	1	Around us , servants milled about carrying things , cleaning , and maintaining the efficiency of the building .
tr	1	With shock , I realized that this entire corridor had been lit by a single window .
tr	2	I know and trust you , of course , but I don 't know these men .
tr	2	I laughed as Jacob took out a second revolver , as well as a wide knife from his boot .
tr	3	At the alarm , our first task was to spirit the king away to the secure room here .
tr	4	Checks on all persons were conducted , and searches for suspicious objects , signs , and intruders were undertaken .
tr	2	As shouts of defiance and rejection arose from our side , I looked to the king .
tr	4	Then , as one , a report from a musket filled the room and someone cried " Treachery ! "
tr	1	I watched two of the enemy assist him in this , dragging him to a kneeling position .
tr	2	The monarch clutched his shoulder , and the wound continued to pulsate , gushing scarlet blood onto the floor .
tr	1	Kurt moved to kick him , but Fuchs again held up a hand , clicking his tongue as well .
tr	1	He cackled and said " The only problem I find with you all is your lack of vision .
tr	0	Have Phillip 's body brought to the palace , and arrange an honor guard for the occasion .
tr	3	But , with time and the Faith 's apparent talents , anything could be learned from a prisoner .
tr	2	Fuchs , at the front of the procession , called out the various turns , and we followed .
tr	3	Two large skylights revealed the morning sky , casting large swaths of light into the giant room .
tr	2	You know my brother loved the sport of hunting , and he often spent summers away from us .
tr	2	For now , let us mourn our lost , and remove these dogs from our sight . "
tr	2	The summoned man was flying from door to door back down the hallway , throwing them open .
tr	0	We can 't scream that high , " said Logan , a cocksure grin on his face .
tr	4	Drop your weapons , " spoke a woman 's voice behind us , further up the passage .
tr	0	Chapter XIV Eva moved the pistol back and forth , aiming the barrel at each guard in turn .
tr	2	" Forgive me for saying this , but you shoot quite well , especially for a woman .
tr	0	I assumed it wasn 't often that three guards , accompanying a beautiful woman , dashed about the kitchens .
tr	3	" If you didn 't notice , there 's a mountain range just north of the city .
tr	3	I could hear voices discussing something , but I couldn 't catch anything but the tone .
tr	4	We 'd reached the main entrance , and Jacob must have been arguing with the guards .
tr	0	You have to have orders to leave with a royal carriage , " said an official voice .
tr	4	The Archduke 's mistress wishes to leave , to be rid of this place for the moment .
tr	2	Jacob had slipped into his authoritative role once more , beautifully shouting at the poor guard .
tr	1	I need ... I need a doctor , or I won 't be chasing anything soon . "
tr	4	She shouted direction out the window , and we wound through the streets , seeking the monastery .
tr	0	Logan and I carried Jacob in and laid him on a table at the priest 's direction .
tr	4	Before we could answer , a dozen monks bustled up bearing cloths , boiled water and medical tools .
tr	4	Logan just steered us towards the looming mountains , and our chosen streets ran nearer to the shadowy peaks .
tr	0	Speeding onwards , we passed farm carts , trotting ponies , and walking peasants , all bearing farming tools .
tr	1	Nearby , Logan 's horse galloped neck and neck with mine , its rider stone-faced and frowning in concentration .
tr	3	In contrast to the dusty road we 'd just left , this highway was well paved .
tr	4	Crows screeched their calls through the branches , and the press of the woods bore down on us .
tr	0	Trees had started to appear again , but the fog was still as thick as ever .
tr	4	The horses ' feet hit the ground and rose , touched and lifted , flying down the path .
tr	4	The Courtier rose in his saddle , screaming to part the crowd before his galloping horse .
tr	0	Raising a long arm , he grabbed the rail and started hoisting himself onto the car .
tr	1	Swinging about , I saw the platform filling with angry men , uniformed policemen leading the charge .
tr	3	My pulse still throbbing , I leaned out of the train , grasping the stair rail for support .
tr	1	Swinging my revolver around , I fired off a few rounds , hoping to dispel the pursuit .
tr	3	Bullets flying about them , the police and the mob decided catching us wasn 't worth dying for .
tr	1	But as I walked in , I glimpsed my friend collapsed and panting on the ground .
tr	1	" Would you mind acting civilized for just a moment and telling me just what 's so comical ? "
tr	0	Just now you rush over and have the gall to ask if I 'm alright . "
tr	3	You wouldn 't think it from his background in writing , but he 's pretty tough . "
tr	0	That night the Faith ambushed us near Rome -- he knew his way about a fight .
tr	1	At once terrifying , saddening , and maddening , I 'd been caught up in the moment .
tr	2	Just enjoying our own coach as it were , " said Logan , brushing dust from his uniform .
tr	3	There 's a group of eight tottering women up near the front , but not many others .
tr	3	Come to think of it , we did hear a bit of shouting , but that 's normal too .
tr	4	You get your coins changed and things will feel more at home again , hmm ? "
tr	3	" If it comes at all , let 's hope it 's not this night then . "
tr	4	Eventually I must have drifted off to sleep , for Logan shook me awake some time later .
tr	0	The chase and fracas at the platform had left me gritty , sweaty , and generally rumpled .
tr	3	Straightening our clothes as best as possible , we strode through the car and exited onto the platform .
tr	3	Walking briskly , but not so fast as to draw unwanted attention , we strode through the dark streets .
tr	4	Following Eva 's directions , we wove to the west and arrived at the outskirts of the village .
tr	3	Within moments though that light was gone , the clouds again submerging the moon under their folds .
tr	3	Besides , with the mountain pass , there wasn 't any way to get lines though .
tr	1	I raised my fist again , but before I could knock , a rumbling filled the entryway .
tr	3	It 's not as if we get many visitors , but you can 't be too careful . "
tr	1	The bloody man keeps the staff running to and fro , carrying meals and fetching books .
tr	4	He 'll be chained up now , and two guards sleep in the room as well .
tr	2	For now , it 's good to know he 's guarded , but let 's eat .
tr	0	He 'd already drawn his blade , and light danced on the honed saber as Logan approached our host .
tr	2	" If you value your life , you will be deathly silent , or you will be dead . "
tr	1	It 's on your neck , and it could be in your neck in a moment .
tr	2	Despite his efforts the wound pulsed blood , staining his black uniform and sloshing to the floor around us .
tr	1	Kneeling , I removed the knife from his back and used it to slice a hunk from his nightshirt .
tr	0	Returning to Logan , I wiped away what blood I could and wrapped the cut as tightly as possible .
tr	4	Logan made to rise , but made the mistake of supporting himself with the wounded arm .
tr	2	I took the footman 's pistol with us ; my own weapon was nearly out of cartridges .
tr	3	A burst of light from the room filled the darkness , and a tall , slight man rushed out .
tr	1	Logan , watching it all , began smiling , a grim display of teeth in the gloom .
tr	0	The most notable thing about him though was the short knife he held in the other hand .
tr	1	The Courtier 's eyes bulged in their sockets , and his face was twitching in agitation .
tr	2	" You might as well come out now ; it 'd be easier for the lot of you . "
tr	1	" We didn 't plan on giving you any in the first place , " shot back Logan .
tr	3	From the second story , it wasn 't a far drop , but it was enough .
tr	2	I turned to follow , but as I did , a howling echoed across the fields .
tr	2	Regardless , the two men looked furtively through the gloom , no doubt searching for us .
tr	3	It was fortunate that they lacked hunting dogs , or we 'd been caught for sure .
tr	1	Glancing behind , I saw the two men just cresting a hill to disappear over its rise .
tr	4	Grasping our arms to keep us close in the gloom , he led us expertly through the forest .
tr	2	Having broken through this , we took a step back and listened for any sounds of pursuit .
tr	1	Another possessed a rack of muskets , pistols , and rifles , with powder and shot to accompany them .
tr	1	" My God of mercy , " let out Phillip , placing his head in his hands .
tr	4	It seemed that the trees hadn 't hit the ground before they were firing upon us from all directions .
tr	2	" Speaking of which , we should find something to get that off , " said Logan .
tr	2	I 've almost grown fond of the damned things , I 've worn them for so long .
tr	0	If the plan had failed and Fuchs and his gang were captured , they had a way out .
tr	1	It took long , delicate filings to proceed ; we had to avoid grating Phillip 's leg .
tr	3	Two cots rested along the floor , and I demurred to the others to take them .
tr	2	Both of those are possible , and any mistake on our parts and we 're lost .
tr	4	Anyone we send is liable to talk freely or lead Fuchs ' men back to us .
tr	3	Unfortunately , I caught one on my shoulder and struggled with it for a few moments .
tr	1	If there was , it 'd look like me -- with only half of an unfitting uniform . "
tr	4	The more I thought of it however , the more this seemed a disadvantage than a boon .
tr	3	But wandering through the tall grass along the road , I put those thoughts from my mind .
tr	4	I again walked down the path around the hamlet 's perimeter , retracing my steps from the night before .
tr	3	I need to get to the capital today by train , and the government can 't accept this . "
tr	0	I ducked my head as much as possible , attempting to avoid his gaze at all costs .
tr	1	No one was looking around , and the hue and cry certainly hadn 't been raised .
tr	0	Along with the images , King Martin was offering a heavy reward for information leading to our capture .
tr	0	To be described as ' deadly and dangerous ' was a far stretch by any imagination .
tr	1	I smiled as the others went about their daily lives , wishing I could join in their leisure .
tr	3	One of them will make a mistake , and I want to be there in time to catch it .
tr	2	No one bothered me , and I was more than content to sit and brood by myself .
tr	0	The landscape swirled by in a rush , and I was again struck by the beauty of this country .
tr	0	Near the top of the pass , a kindly peasant asked if I wanted a ride .
tr	0	The man apologized as we neared his farm , and I hopped off with many cries of thanks .
tr	4	It 's been two days since the coup , and he 's already started the changes .
tr	2	The question took me off guard , so to speak , and I barked a short laugh .
tr	2	What really matters is that he 's incredibly loyal to Martin , Phillip , and myself .
tr	3	I traced my way through the dark city , but soon , I was too lost to continue .
tr	1	I had an address , but without knowing the city it was impossible to find my way .
tr	1	But if I 'd be more recognizable in the light , I couldn 't help it .
tr	4	Each time was cathartic , and the stench of the alleyway was forgotten as I centered myself .
tr	4	I redoubled my pace , the soles of my feet loping across the ground like a fleeing stag .
tr	1	During all of this , I had reached into my waistcoat and pulled the revolver from within .
tr	1	I threw myself into a dark alley , knocking crates and abandoned rubble to the ground in my flight .
tr	4	Looming above me was the royal palace , the perimeter fence directly in front of me .
tr	4	People stared curiously at me , but then my pursuers left the alley and cried for help .
tr	0	Stumbling , I launched into another dark alleyway , splashing water from a puddle in my flight .
tr	3	They 're not moving this way , but it 'd be death for us all if they did .
tr	2	She led me down a long hallway , nodding silently to several monks along the way .
tr	0	The hallway snaked after a bit , leading us along a winding path through the monastery .
tr	4	We turned through several arched doorways , climbed and descended stairs , and finally came to a sunlit greenhouse .
tr	4	We 're safe here as long as no one leads the police to the door . "
tr	0	The idea of a charlatan replacing the king is laughable , and that 's Fuchs ' genius .
tr	1	It was a while ago , but I can simply remind him if he 's forgotten . "
tr	4	We 'll follow when we can , and things should sort themselves out from there . "
tr	0	" Well , if you had , you 'd have noticed a rather flattering spread of drawings .
tr	3	The fact that they didn 't place my face in the paper isn 't proof of anything .
tr	2	Jacob continued to heal , although any large movements sent jolts of pain through his back .
tr	4	It would be weeks before he healed well enough to actually participate in any action we planned .
tr	2	In the end , we took the crowns and promised to put them to good use .
tr	3	The transition elicited sharp grunts of pain from the man , but he refused to complain .
tr	4	" Give me one solid reason why I shouldn 't kill you where you stand , stranger . "
tr	1	Some man sneaks towards us in the darkness , and you expect me to know who it is ?
tr	4	I explained my trip , my meeting with Joseph , and the rendezvous at the monastery .
tr	0	Perhaps we 'd finally start righting the mess that had fallen about us like a haze .
tr	4	Now I grinned as a I glimpsed the monks ' carriage in the trees by the path .
tr	1	They smiled in greeting but didn 't appear to comprehend our visit until they saw Phillip .
tr	4	" I see by your faces , gentleman , that our reputation precedes us , " I said .
tr	2	About the room 's floor , which was finely polished hardwood , dozens of students practiced .
tr	3	In contrast to the boys who led us into the institute , students here were of various ages .
tr	2	The motions within the room swirled about , and I failed to notice Eva and Jacob approach .
tr	0	As the group wandered on , I held back a moment to speak with Jacob and Eva .
tr	2	But if I may be so boorish and bold ... can they all be trusted ? "
tr	0	" Now that we 're all safe , may I ask what our course will be ? "
tr	1	Logan and I spent many a night drinking coffee and chatting wildly into the wee hours .
tr	4	I 'd been enchanted before , but with each snippet of an anecdote she became more real somehow .
tr	4	After a few goblets of sherry , that 'd be different , but every man has his vices . "
tr	0	We saw museums and famous landmarks , and all the while the scum had Phillip as their prisoner .
tr	2	The other man won of course -- I was too out of practice with the formal rules .
tr	1	He tapped my elbow , driving it closer to my side and bringing my guard tighter against my frame .
tr	3	" That 's right , " snapped Jacob good-naturedly and went off to find the fencing master .
tr	3	He wasn 't good at first , and it took him awhile to master the basics .
tr	2	" If you 'd had your entire life stolen from you , would you be fine ?
tr	4	The minister of war urged us to continue our work and be prepared at a moment 's notice .
tr	2	Simon shook me awake , and I blinked up at him through the darkness of the dormitory .
tr	3	The cliché was a bit much , but seeing the others around the room , it was true .
tr	0	Phillip , Jacob , Logan , Eva , and I were eliminated right away for obvious reasons .
tr	2	Finally the lot was drawn , and a lanky fellow with shockingly blond hair was selected .
tr	3	" I traveled by train mostly , but it still took a couple of days to reach the place .
tr	2	More than once , the other masons and I took a break to sip from it .
tr	3	But as Nathaniel pointed out , there 's more than one thing that can go wrong . "
tr	2	All of the other doors are too thick , too guarded , or too visible to use . "
tr	0	He was practically a fish until they started making us learn pointless languages ... like German . "
tr	3	If I haven 't gotten too much worse at it , the swim itself shouldn 't be a problem .
tr	4	After a seemingly endless parade of dishes , wines , and conversation , the party broke up .
tr	4	The words glided by unnoticed , and I began turning the pages without really reading them .
tr	0	He settled into an armchair , leaning against the leather padding like it was a crutch .
tr	0	My forefather had saved Logan 's ancestor 's life and I was a noble as a result .
tr	1	Chapter XXV A twig snapped and we froze in the darkness , snow trickling down around us .
tr	1	So , after debate and endless , if hurried , preparations , our assassins drifted away from the school .
tr	4	Then before hypothermia set in , I would rush down to the kitchens and let in the vengeful horde .
tr	1	Laying him down , I shut his eyes and covered my work by shifting his jacket .
tr	0	I traced my hand along the castle 's wall , moving downwards , ever downwards through the watery mist .
tr	1	As Rupert had said , it was massive , and I would have no problem fitting inside .
tr	1	It moved slightly , so I pressed more , throwing my weight and ramming my shoulder up against it .
tr	2	One could easily stretch from side to side and not come close to touching both ends .
tr	3	I put it from my mind as one of the two yawned , then Kurt spoke .
tr	4	Even as he spoke , I heard a loud scraping as he opened the thick kitchen door .
tr	4	Eva came next , and the look Kurt gave her was enough for me to growl .
tr	0	" Anyway , the bastard sees our numbers and takes off running towards the castle to give the alarm .
tr	3	I moved to her , and with a slight grin towards Kurt , put a hand onto her arm .
tr	2	You 're bound to need someone to look after your back , " she said with a quick laugh .
tr	4	The legs of the others struggled to keep up as the pair of us sprinted down the corridors .
tr	0	The warm light of a lamp bathed us as the fallen Courtier and I stared at each other .
tr	2	Around us , from behind the other doors in the atrium , I could hear voices .
tr	3	After a moment , this line advanced forward , driving the battle towards the looming students .
tr	4	Tall , with long arms , the man 's saber sliced through the air beside me .
tr	3	But the slash along my arm from the rusted bar in the great hall 's pipe was throbbing too .
tr	3	I sought to move towards the stairway , but another man stepped to block my path .
tr	1	Even as I watched , a crimson tide began staining his nightshirt just above his breast .
tr	3	Together , they broke off from fighting and dashed to meet me at the foot of the stairs .
tr	3	This hatch was nearly closed , but a trickle of light escaped and lit the rungs below it .
tr	2	Somewhere above , a woman was crying softly , a series of low sobs echoing around us .
tr	4	Exiting the trapdoor , we were bathed in a gorgeous light from dozens of candles and lamps .
tr	1	Ornate rugs and paintings lined the floors and walls , and the tower was a den of opulence .
tr	4	A comfortable , four-poster bed rested against one side , and the room itself was quite large .
tr	4	Mercedes writhed , her face clouded by tears , and her shredded dress hung off one shoulder .
tr	3	His black jacket , set apart from his guards ' by gilded stitching , lay forgotten at his feet .
tr	4	Her frame had began to quiver uncontrollably , and she whimpered , tears again coursing down her flushed cheeks .
tr	2	God didn 't make us equal ; God made us noble , and God made us peasant .
tr	1	" If you so much as touch her , I will flay your skin and watch you suffer .
tr	2	I promise you on God and all your false principles that nothing will save you ! "
tr	4	A look of utter terror crossed the charlatan 's eyes before it was replaced by inconsolable loathing .
tr	2	Ignoring this , I looked into Logan 's eyes , and the bleeding Jacob was forgotten .
tr	2	He cut through the water in front of me and before long was onshore and running towards the woods .
tr	0	He beat against my saber , each blow a ringing swipe that set my hands to shaking .
tr	3	But so was I , the gash from the rusted pipe still throbbing in the cold .
tr	1	I flicked my saber around his guards , nicking him occasionally but failing to land another solid cut .
tr	2	I moved to block this , but before I could , he threw a solid swing on my left .
tr	1	He 'd spilt blood in God 's name and would do it again in an instant .
tr	0	Under the Faith 's rule , an authoritarian king would simply have you drawn and quartered .
tr	2	If he made a move , I tried to tell myself I 'd actually kill him .
tr	3	My supporters allowed me to take control of the coup , but they wouldn 't let me kill him .
tr	1	To learn that he 'd used us , was even now using us , was sickening .
tr	4	Or at least , the remembrance of another waited , for we couldn 't find his body .
tr	1	Somehow the man slipped through the night and crossed , as His Majesty 's spies reported , into Austria .
tr	2	Around us , the sound continued to dissipate as onlookers followed the king to the streets .
tr	4	He 'd flown from his country , a raven , a vulture escaping the descending storm .
tr	4	The bookcases loomed overhead , but our eyes were drawn to the man resting in the sunlight .
tr	0	As he lay bleeding , Logan and I had leapt into the night , leaving him .
tr	3	" Horrid to be sure , but what does that have to do with us ? "
tr	1	He 's taken rather unkindly to Phillip 's dismissal of Fuchs ' economic and military alliance proposals .
tr	2	A lover of history and fantasy , Michael now writes to show the personal side of the past .
tr	3	With Phillip , Martin 's twin brother , restored to the throne , things were slowly returning to normal .
tr	0	We 'd watched him put a bullet straight through the king 's head and laugh as the body fell .
tr	4	Kurt Weber , Fuchs ' second , had been captured in our failed attempt to assassinate the imposter king .
tr	2	Although he was as guilty as sin , I had looked on the proceedings with some worry .
tr	0	It was modeled after the royal guard , but ours had an extra scarlet stripe along both shoulders .
tr	3	After a short wait , the four guards posted outside led us into the throne room .
tr	4	Like some shrouded phantom , the face the light illuminated was haunted , the eyes sunken .
tr	2	They 'd killed his brother , and I 'd be damned if they would kill him too .
tr	1	" We did briefly , Your Majesty -- " Phillip cut him off with a hand .
tr	4	After several turns and a descent down the long stair , we came to the main foyer .
tr	1	Kurt Weber sat across from his priest , a large , young man I didn 't recognize .
tr	4	He whispered " Thank you , " before his priest took him and angled him towards the executioner .
tr	3	Without waiting a moment , the priest tossed him the sword and drew another small blade .
tr	2	Next they cut down several foolish onlookers who tried to stop the crisis unfolding about us .
tr	4	While my place was at the Emperor 's side , to risk escape now was certain death .
tr	0	A little overeager , I 'd raised my head above the courtyard 's walls for only an instant .
tr	0	For my part , I hoisted my own weapon , again raising myself above the wall .
tr	0	A burly sergeant , his arms clutching a makeshift ladder , was barreling forward like some enraged bull .
tr	1	My newfound friend clapped me on the back , a grim smiling flowing along his face .
tr	1	Frenchmen had gone to meet them , and humanity was abandoned in the vicious hand-to-hand struggle .
tr	2	I found it in the face of a boy , his eyes too young , too pure for war .
tr	2	Although my foot slipped through something , blood or grime I wasn 't sure , I arrived without calamity .
tr	4	Henri even stooped to pet his kitten one last time before the sergeant dragged him away by the arm .
tr	1	One morning , as the dawn squinted through the barn 's slats , I sat milking .
tr	4	But my husband , my Philippe , had died under the weight of Napoleon 's taxes .
tr	3	She ran a cloth along the counters and the knotted table , the soapy water swirling .
tr	3	But I couldn 't stop the tears as I set all but one of the usual places for dinner .
tr	0	As always , her onion stew was filling , and the bread was delicious and warm .
tr	4	He loomed for ages before stepping into the house , swiftly and violently slamming the door in his wake .
tr	1	Perhaps my son had become a ghoul ; I could not understand this change , this demonic possession .
tr	2	I stood up , at a loss for what to do , drowning in a sea of despair .
tr	1	I just let the wind twirl my tresses as we stared across the patchwork of fields .
tr	1	I paused in the doorway , taking in the morning sun , troubled , but thankful for his homecoming .
tr	4	Finally , the rough men dragged Henri , bleeding in several places , from the home .
tr	2	If I could legally kill him right now , I would gut the coward where he lies . "
tr	4	Given Ainsworth 's hunger , Ward thought the man would enjoy the Steamed Cloud 's portions as well .
tr	4	Instead , he continued his search , his eyes dancing from face to face across the great hall .
tr	1	I 'd ask for several minutes of your time to discuss particulars , " Ainsworth spoke formally .
tr	0	On the contrary , the man walked around the table and stood over Ward 's chair .
tr	0	In a fluid , single action , he threw out a hand , striking Ward across the face .
tr	1	The morning found Ainsworth shaking him awake , a nervous expression clouding the larger man 's face .
tr	2	" Thank you Winston ; I 'd hoped you would know where to find me . "
tr	3	" By my estimation , Lieutenant - your boys gave at least twice as good as they got .
tr	0	The First DEMON Company had accounted for at least four times as many casualties as it had sustained .
tr	2	" I would love to tell you what tomorrow has in store for us , " he said .
tr	0	The Laird of the Castle shook each man 's hand and bid them to take a seat .
tr	3	" Yes , my Laird , " The Sergeant Major stood and called the gathering to attention .
tr	0	" Lieutenant Flaherty , as you well know , the commander of a tank company is normally a Captain .
tr	2	Llama is here , too , but he 's run off to play with some others . "
tr	3	" Penny , can I trust that you 'll have him back to the Castle by 0600 ? "
tr	4	He had noticeably more grey at the temples than the last time Destro had seen him .
tr	2	" Clayton , it 's good to see you , " Destro said as he shook the offered hand .
tr	0	Loc made a face as if to indicate that he was offended Llama would even suggest such a thing .
tr	3	Flaherty felt good about the group , felt as though they had the potential to be an unbeatable team .
tr	2	" Sir , I trust you 'll be able to find your own way home ? "
tr	4	Chapter 46 Flaherty rolled out of bed when the alarm sounded and made his way to the shower .
tr	0	He watched her as she dried off and wished that he wasn 't on such a tight schedule .
tr	3	He resigned himself to the fact that it wasn 't optional , kissed Penny and hopped out .
tr	3	Aren 't you afraid that you 'll suddenly realize that this life isn 't for you ?
tr	3	Misfit gave Huerta a look that communicated that implored , ' please stop provoking him ' .
tr	2	A small tripod with a telescopic spotter 's scope sat on the floor in front of him .
tr	3	He was sitting at his desk in the most recent incarnation of ' The Pit ' .
tr	4	Voice # 2 : " What did you not understand , the orders were quite clear . "
tr	0	" All four are back on full duty and the unit is operational , my Laird . "
tr	1	Each contained weapons , ammunition and other items that would aid the team in blending in with their surroundings .
tr	3	We 're to meet our transport on the north lawn in a little over two hours . "
tr	1	The planning is underway for an incursion and Laird Destro wants us over there ASAP . "
tr	4	Iceberg took the site best suited for direct fire on what appeared to be the facility 's entrance .
tr	1	Blizzard and Frostbite occupied firing positions behind and to either side of Iceberg , each facing outboard .
tr	4	" That basically means that we 're flying over there in case some shit goes down .
tr	4	Snow Job and Iceberg knelt in the center of the perimeter , preparing to move out .
tr	1	Snow Job 's heart skipped a beat as he squinted to look up at his captors .
tr	1	Snow Job struggled weakly against his restraints as the second man spoke into a small radio .
tr	2	Would you like to talk to me now , or shall I send you to join them ? "
tr	1	He didn 't just dislike it ; he hated it with an intense , burning passion .
tr	4	They plan to take a nice stroll past the place and see what they can see .
tr	3	We 're supposed to sit tight and see if their little walk stirs anything up . "
tr	3	Snow Job tried to stand , but his legs failed him and he toppled to the ground again .
tr	4	The feelings of guilt and responsibility tended to conflict with the need to Charlie Mike - continue the mission .
tr	4	The Joes quickly learned that she was referring to several canisters of an experimental sleeping gas .
tr	2	Before Snow Job could respond , both Blizzard and Frostbite responded in unison , " No . "
tr	2	" I 've got two guys to your direct front , and another two moving to flank you . "
tr	1	It was not quite noon and already he 'd picked up quite a bit of information .
tr	2	Judging from the amount of blood , I 'd say that one of them was definitely dead .
tr	2	They did not allow for the occupant to stand or lie down comfortably and were completely dark inside .
tr	1	Destro stood in his private office , gazing out the large window , hands clasped behind his back .
tr	2	" I do not doubt your ability to produce actionable Intel from these men , Colonel .
tr	4	When he was finished , he called for Sergeant Major Duncan , who arrived moments later .
tr	0	" Right away , my Laird , " the Sergeant Major produced his data pad and began tapping away .
tr	3	In short order , they had him strapped into the interrogation rack and stepped away to let Masque work .
tr	1	" Good morning , Herr Strauss , " Masque said , his voice full of menace .
tr	4	Llama looked around the tiny patrol base until he spotted Sergeant Shock and then waved him over .
tr	0	" Aries says that the rest of his Highlanders are now inbound along with the Anvil battalion .
tr	4	The Baroness noted the looks but didn 't have the time or inclination to be concerned .
tr	3	" You have twenty minutes to grab your gear and be on the north lawn to meet your transport .
tr	0	This was not particularly surprising , given that Masque had never asked the dead man any questions .
tr	3	" Admittedly , it has taken us longer than it should have , " Destro said .
tr	4	" You are no doubt familiar with the expression ' sins of the father ' , Sergeant Major ? "
tr	3	" 1st platoon has the center , 2nd is on their left flank and 3rd is on the right .
tr	1	" He 's not gon na want to answer questions with his severed thumbs crammed up his ass . "
tr	0	Vulcan was already clearing the top of the ladder and took up a position to his left .
tr	2	Two more of the Elite Guard followed him out and posted to either side of the doorway .
tr	3	The bunker to the left was a smoking hole , but the middle one was still mostly intact .
tr	0	" So while we 're not allowed to actively participate in combat operations , " Lady Jaye said .
tr	2	Small arms fire could be heard all around ; mostly his own men firing from the sound of it .
tr	4	Despite the severity of their situation , Llama laughed as he grabbed Shock 's arm to help him up .
tr	3	Wang followed closely behind , killing the last of the three with a short burst to the chest .
tr	2	Destro opened a small pouch on his belt and took out what looked like a smart phone .
tr	0	Llama was working his way up the middle of the slight valley with Wry and Reaper .
tr	1	Let 's give ' em something else to focus on so Izzy 's guys can pull back ! "
tr	3	But it was imperative that he kept up the track and was close by when that happened .
tr	3	He 'd been trying to contact Llama since the IED detonation twenty minutes earlier , but without success .
tr	4	He was close enough to hear the sounds of their battle , so he knew they likely needed assistance .
tr	1	" Sir , we 're just about done mopping up this last group , " Ghost answered .
tr	3	Biscuit wasn 't quite fast enough and was hit four times as he tried to take cover .
tr	4	" As soon as he turns toward Izzy 's guys , everyone else hammers the motherfucker ! "
tr	0	A third man stooped slightly and she was draped over his right shoulder not unlike a sack of grain .
tr	4	The Highlanders were preparing to breach the underground complex where Destro believed the super soldier program was based .
tr	0	Hung was just behind him , followed by a half dozen Highlanders from Ghost 's company .
tr	0	Llama looked up the small hill and saw Sergeant Wingnut standing there , awaiting his signal .
tr	0	" Natasha , I cannot tell you what I do not know , " Mayhem explained .
tr	1	" Laird Destro shares your concern and as such , he is withholding any information concerning her whereabouts . "
tr	3	Flaherty knew instantly that the man in that seat could not possibly have survived the blast .
tr	3	The infiltrators were taking heavy fire now from the Highlanders , who had caught on to their true intent .
tr	4	Inferno reached the entrance and extended an arm to send a jet of flaming napalm into the bunker interior .
tr	1	As he did , a flurry of small arms fire drove him back from the opening .
tr	1	They passed by Corporal Gundam , who was applying a dressing to First Sergeant King 's burnt leg .
tr	4	they responded in unison , not really knowing what they were saying they were ready for .
tr	3	All of which meant that there was exactly nothing left for Ghost to do but sit and wait .
tr	4	" I need to get topside and coordinate coverage on those two sites before we go any further .
tr	3	Then , I think we need to start staging 2nd Battalion to assault through here properly . "
tr	4	His platoon had been running patrols through the city streets since the capital had fallen to the Grenadier forces .
tr	3	Then he turned slowly back toward the Earth and activated his booster pack 's thrusters to begin his descent .
tr	1	Bing elevated the rear of his vehicle and his gunner went to work , the twin cannons pounding away .
tr	1	Loc aimed his high energy hand laser and counted down , waiting until he was within range .
tr	0	" Higher will have help on the way , so this is now a holding action .
tr	0	He was already flying very low , so it was a simple matter of pulling into a hover .
tr	3	The gunshot wound to his side was almost certainly not fatal , but it hurt like hell .
tr	1	Destro instinctively looked to the Baroness and saw Nirvana running toward her while firing at something overhead .
tr	4	Destro and the Baroness were still locked in an embrace , oblivious to the happenings around them .
tr	4	With what appeared to be minimal effort , he twisted and the handle broke free with a metallic clang .
tr	4	He tossed the handle aside and grabbed the edges of the door , forcing it open .
tr	1	Corporal Hunger was yelling for him to move , but Flaherty 's ears were still ringing from the blast .
tr	4	He landed hard on his side and didn 't move , save for the movement of his ragged breathing .
tr	3	" The last of them were flown out about twenty minutes ago , my Laird . "
tr	3	I am determined to put to rest what my father failed to bury so many years ago . "
tr	4	The Detonator teams are already working and we should be ready to go within the next two hours . "
tr	4	-- Oasis , The First Traveller Welcome to this realm young one , how was your journey here ?
tr	4	The dog was like a Doberman and seemed to revel in the exercise , thoughts seemingly only of play .
tr	4	Delayed momentarily by pensive mental processes , his mind presented the image of the young tree he passed by .
tr	3	Instantly his mind was drawn to his class on fractals , the natural method of continuity and growth .
tr	3	He saw it for what it was , the root of temptation , he accepted , he understood .
tr	4	I see the hint of recollection in your eyes but I suspect that my task is nowhere near complete .
tr	2	She was beautiful to look upon ; was she our goddess of war , I wondered .
tr	0	By now she was a stone 's throw away , riding what looked like a metal board .
tr	1	The music changed and dancing began , and then I noticed that they had been drinking .
tr	4	" I know , I have issued orders for the men to be ready by first light .
tr	4	" The Sphinx warriors are different from us , perhaps you should meet with them tonight . "
tr	0	When I was mortal I served under a great leader and led many into battles wining many wars .
tr	3	With the body of a large cat and the most beautiful wings , their form was magnificent and mysterious .
tr	3	Ra , bring them to me at first light , I asked her through my thoughts .
tr	4	Some of the enemy had heavier armour to defend against rifles and they fought the Humans .
tr	1	I gazed at the Citadel , it was immense in size and surprisingly it was not on the ground .
tr	0	My dance was nearing its end and my awareness told me Ra approached with the Sphinx warriors .
tr	3	With the light singing to our souls , attacking the enemy like the straightest arrow , we will prevail !
tr	2	" When you face a mountain , do you ask if the mountain will allow you to climb it ?
tr	1	So as it is with the mountain , it is with this war , " I replied .
tr	0	In my heart sang the song of passage , I looked and saw through space our destination .
tr	0	With a crack and a boom the vertical line expanded , until it was wide enough to allow passage .
tr	4	I guess practice makes perfect , I thought as I admired my doorway to the hidden ways .
tr	0	" Sphinx , Walk with me through the hidden ways , " I called with my mind .
tr	0	I passed through the doorway with Ra at my side and a thousand warriors behind me .
tr	1	Instinctively I cast a shield , however , in a fragmented state I could not hold it indefinitely .
tr	1	While the rest split up and cause as much confusion as possible within the walls of the Citadel .
tr	4	I felt my armour turn-on its defence capabilities , long metallic claws came forth from my gloves .
tr	1	I cried out as I raced to him calling three hundred Sphinx to me , with mind and voice .
tr	2	Sending a hand full of blades deep into it , it sparked and fired and then it stopped .
tr	4	I transmitted to all their minds fuelling their drive and empowering their bodies with new energy .
tr	4	I swung my head back , looking around and saw that more men had revealed themselves , surrounding us .
tr	1	As I rose , I caught another with an uppercut , sending him high in the air .
tr	4	The two taken off their feet were still in the air , seemingly suspended in time .
tr	1	I moved quickly to him , knocking him into the air before he had time to consider my advance .
tr	4	" Traveller , Leave these warriors to us , " I heard the Sphinx call to my mind .
tr	3	Some got hit while others got out of the way , it seemed that they were getting smarter .
tr	1	I stopped the spinning with a loud thump on the ground , causing a small shock wave .
tr	4	I got up smiling , they had given me what I needed to banish them , my blood .
tr	2	With my free hand I took some of my dripping blood and traced symbols on the ground .
tr	0	A fan , and yet this is thy work , " Tiamat replied with a laugh .
tr	4	Thine allies themselves shall unleash destruction upon thy treasured rock and this will sadden thy kin greatly .
tr	4	There seemed to be no end to the blast as it grew eating at everything in its path .
tr	0	Slowly Gaia was sucked in and I witnessed the destruction of a planet and the death of many .
tr	3	Brothers ... Sisters ... My thoughts went out in every direction , sending out my call .
tr	4	I stopped for a moment and considered alerting the base but I quickly disregard the thought .
tr	4	I did , " he replied , while I searched for where his voice was coming from .
tr	3	For a moment it was silent and I felt a tingle at the back of my neck .
tr	0	" You can kill me anytime you want , why are you toying with me ? "
tr	4	Are you trying to tell me you are the good guy and my leader is the bad guy ?
tr	4	There were four guards , the general , the being and a representative from the New World Order .
tr	3	Adam speaks the truth and with that thought , the video stopped and the sky cleared .
tr	3	" Loads but the quickest way to put it would be , stop him at all costs . "
tr	2	On my left side was the door Adam spoke about with a cloak on the ground beside it .
tr	2	I continued to scope the room and I noticed another access point not far from my current position .
tr	1	Quickly , while maintaining cover , I made my way and retrieved information on the building and its occupants .
tr	3	I could no longer control my rage towards it , this thing that killed my brethren .
tr	0	I saw its face make a gasp and then it smiled as it continued its approach .
tr	0	" Yes you may have destroyed a part of the plan but North America will still fall .
tr	0	They are like parasites , take , take , take , that is all a human knows .
tr	3	I blocked the latter with my leg , spinning with it into a round house that he ducked .
tr	0	The ground was fast approaching ... Well this is it ... Goodbye beautiful world , thanks for having me .
tr	4	All will be clear in time , do not rush it , your memories will be replenished with time .
tr	4	Dragging my little case behind me , I joined the group a little distance away from the majority congregation .
tr	4	No man could ever see into my heart and so they will never know my true intentions .
tr	0	I had once heard a quote ' ... a man can never be an island unto himself ... ' .
tr	0	It was a pretty sky and I walked towards the only seats in this open area .
tr	1	One morning while I was going through my morning ritual , stretching and renewing my body .
tr	4	He slowly walked towards me , leaning every so often on the stout cane he carried .
tr	4	He wore a sleeveless short cotton coat about knee length and it was buttoned to the side .
tr	1	" Not much to tell , I am from Trinidad , I studied Linguistics and Philosophy .
tr	1	Besides that didn 't sound like his usual jovial self , something is wrong ... " Who ?
tr	2	Heads turned to see the commotion and screams soon followed upon recognition of Sheena 's gun .
tr	3	They advanced slowly and I stood to my full height , fists held up at the ready .
tr	3	I bent and picked up two metal batons , they would be charged as a result of contact .
tr	1	I flipped , bringing my heel down hard on the head of one , leaving him unconscious .
tr	0	Two pistols on her hip and two large daggers on her waist , and she also carried a backpack .
tr	4	Beads of water rolled off her body as she walked angrily towards me , muttering under her breath .
tr	0	I added with rage , releasing a ball off light as I brought my hands together .
tr	0	I need to grab a paper from that store , can you call us a cab ? "
tr	0	I glanced at it ... ' What has Sinclair got to declare ' the front page read .
tr	3	I started to make my way to the right , a short cut to the exit .
tr	1	I saw a flicker of light and I felt a powerful force propel my victim into those behind him .
tr	0	The enemy began another attack and we fought hard , as they got faster and remarkably stronger .
tr	4	" Hurry they are getting much stronger , " She said and her voice carried to me .
tr	1	I regained control and stopped filling myself with this mysterious energy , this static of mine .
tr	1	" This is the same aura that was controlling those drones and the same that possessed my General . "
tr	0	Catching him off-guard , he discarded his hostages and materialised his blade to parry my blow .
tr	0	In a flash his arm caught me in the chin and sent me back a distance .
tr	2	I dropped my blade in the air and drew my pistols and I rained slugs on Nuru .
tr	2	You who exist solely for your own gain , you disgust me , " Adam replied .
tr	0	The enemy had encircled him but now they made a path and a man in unusual armour walked through .
tr	4	The grip on his blades loosened as his strength left him , sapped by the newcomers attack .
tr	0	Looking back to Ezra he said , " Now you will watch as I make your race extinct . "
tr	1	I suspect that it is by this means she has created much dissonance in the fabrics .
tr	2	I would also like to thank my other half , who encouraged me to put my words on paper .
tr	4	" You 've completed your schooling and now , my friend , it 's time to celebrate . "
tr	0	" No ; the earls ' bodyguards only stand around all day and protect their liege . "
tr	4	I 've seen you practice with your axe often -- and win duels , at that .
tr	1	But those dark days were , indeed , coming : month after month of howling wind and endless snow .
tr	3	The quest will take you to far-flung places ; to places you 'd never thought to travel .
tr	0	He tried to drag him away , but Gunnar was too heavy for Brand to move him .
tr	1	" -- Gunnar , what noble line you belong to , " the king 's man finished .
tr	3	But once they left the jurisdiction , clan law would force Sven 's men to stop their pursuit .
tr	2	" If you 're looking for gold , we don 't have any , " Gunnar said .
tr	4	But if we recover the Idol of the Great Mother , he 'd forgive us for our deeds .
tr	3	The air was cold -- this far north , the air was often cold , but this felt unusual .
tr	4	Morrie sat at a rekindled fire , boiling something sweet in a pot , perhaps morning tea .
tr	3	Morrie took the pot off the fire and set it into the cold , hard dirt .
tr	0	It towered above them and at the top was a spacious den of wattle and daub .
tr	4	Her pink eyes will always be watching , and her Evil Eye will always be on them . "
tr	1	It was like a bad wind , a wind you could only feel in your mind .
tr	2	He was no match for the Idol of the Great Mother , the barrow witch 's most prized possession .
tr	2	Soon , snow would lie on their boughs , but for now , the land was green .
tr	2	" Men of great honor , I salute you , " Brand said , choosing his words carefully .
tr	2	I do not know if Sven Oster can ever forgive you for what you 've done .
tr	1	" If you do not deliver it , I will put you back on the Hangman 's List .
tr	3	" Next time , listen to me when I do not trust a person 's intentions . "
tr	0	His battalion was attacked by White Wolves and he was the only smart one ; he ran away .
tr	0	CHAPTER FOUR Brand awoke to a hard kick and a sword point pressed against his neck .
tr	4	" You shouldn 't sleep with your guard down , " she said in a cheerful voice .
tr	4	Together , the three of them sat around the crackling flames and reveled in the warmth .
tr	3	I do not let men stuff me in a little dress and tell me what to do .
tr	4	" He was horrible to behold , " she continued , " and he smelled like horse dung .
tr	3	Both times , they caught me and beat me until I truly realized that I had to submit .
tr	2	By now the fire had died down slightly and both Gunnar and Brand were huddled around it .
tr	0	As Hilda flayed and removed the meat from the dead rabbit , a light rain began .
tr	0	" They are all at war , " Henrik said , " just as you will be tomorrow .
tr	0	" Then by Vana 's harp , she is an aberration indeed , " Henrik said .
tr	3	" If they stray from the fire ... if they get too cold , they will succumb . "
tr	2	But Hilda stood up and shouted , " How dare you sing of such things ? "
tr	3	He set his lute against the wall and ran after Hilda , following her outside into the windy night .
tr	1	And I think you 'd be a better boy if you stop singing such vile songs . "
tr	1	" There is evil in that forest , and the evil is hungry , " Hilda said .
tr	1	Directly in front of him , towering above the dark pines , was an impossibly tall , snowy peak .
tr	1	A chill ran through his bones , and it wasn 't caused by the snow or wind .
tr	4	He hesitated with the child , but reminded himself this was a demon , not a boy .
tr	4	A voice -- childish yet cold as a snake 's eyes -- said , " Neither will you . "
tr	2	" You know , if you walk to the Darkling Wood , Gunnar will be long gone .
tr	4	" Storytellers -- dreamers like you -- have told me about what lies in the Darkling Wood .
tr	1	" It is time to end this conversation ; I 've grown bored with your dumbness , girl . "
tr	2	One White Wolf dashed up to Brand and lay down on the floor , then barked .
tr	4	Only then did he realize that the wolf had scratched two crude runes into the ice .
tr	4	I know , my friend is in danger , " Brand said , baffled that these wolves were communicating .
tr	2	Then she howled and took off , bounding up toward the mountains , toward the place she came from .
tr	2	" The honorable Lord Harald has no desire whatsoever to harbor the unwanted , sickly , or poor .
tr	1	Despite his sleepiness , Brand smiled wearily ; not a single thing Hilda had just said was true .
tr	4	" Go to the Sunset Inn on the bay and tell the innkeeper I sent you .
tr	0	" The White Wolf said to take him to a holy place , " Brand said .
tr	3	In their private chamber , Brand dripped the mead down Gunnar 's throat little by little .
tr	2	She moved over to Brand 's bed and laid a hand around his shoulder , then hugged him tight .
tr	2	Only after another hard slash did the bloody head fly off the neck and roll onto the ground .
tr	4	There were a few cheers , but they died down after Harald 's expression turned stern .
tr	1	" I may be a woman , but if you continue , I will be your end . "
tr	1	" If it is darkness you want , I can fill all your idle hours . "
tr	0	The sun was now a twinkling , fading glow against the sea and darkness was fast approaching .
tr	0	Across the room , through iron bars , he could see that Hilda had finished hers .
tr	4	Brand stared at her in disbelief , and then they both burst out laughing , howling like wolves .
tr	1	" I 'd kiss you until you couldn 't breathe and your lips turned raw . "
tr	2	" Old in body , but older in the soul ; I would not let you kiss me .
tr	1	" I 'll make you both kiss my rump if you don 't shut up ! "
tr	3	I will not kill Hilda straightaway , though I regret that I must , and soon . "
tr	1	Gunnar 's body crumpled inward , then turned to gray powder , and then to nothing .
tr	0	Brand shivered , thinking of that dream , and felt a mix of guilt and fear .
tr	4	" I suppose , " the other said , " if the lord baron agrees . "
tr	4	Better to send her beheaded ; they would torture her and then hang her publicly in that barbaric keep .
tr	2	" I do not wish our house to be cowardly , " said Harald 's wife .
tr	0	" Although I defend him often , I am afraid that I am not particularly close to him . "
tr	3	But the truth is -- as a ... man -- Harald can only get stiff in the brothel .
tr	2	I know well from today what happens to those who get on his bad side . "
tr	2	" Only my husband knows ; yet I can sense you have a good , trustworthy heart .
tr	0	There will be no repercussions ; Harald will not care at all , and you may ask him . "
tr	2	So , too , had the crowd dwindled ; Brand assumed that most were inside huddling by the fire .
tr	2	No one was looking at him ; no one would know about his surrender to temptation .
tr	4	" We have treated you as our equals , though I gather you are common . "
tr	0	Harald said , and then stood up , the gold of his coronet shining in the torchlight .
tr	2	" Will you grant titles of nobility as freely as you give your love to whores ? "
tr	2	" I will peel your skin like an apple , and douse your wounds in salt . "
tr	0	Brand walked up to Harald , realizing he could not withhold what he knew any longer .
tr	1	" Then let 's wait until morning , " Brand said , " and we 'll decide then . "
tr	1	Soon , wrapped in the thick furs of his bed , his breath crystallized into white fog .
tr	1	" I lied to you , " Harald said , his breath also turning to white fog .
tr	0	" They can , " Brand said , " but they turn into savage boars . "
tr	4	Break into every airtight larder , every closet and crate and pot -- everything the light does not touch .
tr	0	But Harald had taken an interest in him , and made him an honorary member of the court .
tr	2	The door was locked -- and with good reason -- so Brand tried to kick down the door .
tr	0	He failed , and had to watch in embarrassment as Harald kicked it down for him .
tr	4	But I 've only seen her in body ; never talked with her , " Harald said .
tr	0	" Sometimes , " Harald said , " but Umbra was brought by my dear wife .
tr	0	If there will be a throne when this is all finished , Brand thought to himself .
tr	4	she shrieked " ... you are not the kind of woman that stays in noble halls . "
tr	3	" Then I walked out into the glass porch , and I saw smoke wafting into the air .
tr	2	The last token of my origins , of the religion of my father and mother ! "
tr	3	Brand didn 't want Harald to be suspicious , despite her protests that His Honor would not care .
tr	3	In the mad dash with Hilda , they had paid no attention to the villages they traveled past .
tr	0	" However , if you disband the River Guard , swear fealty to him -- " Harald laughed darkly .
tr	4	And give her daughters scars , that they may become even uglier than they already are . "
tr	2	I do not care if you bed commoners , or priestesses of Vana , or painted whores .
tr	0	" I would not normally let a commoner say that , but you speak truth , " Harald said .
tr	0	" I take that back ; you are a very strange man , Harald , " Brand said .
tr	3	Throughout the whole ride to the rocky peak , Brand 's mind swam with memories of last night .
tr	2	Why do you come to our temple of dragon 's sons , fair lady of high birth ?
tr	4	The other junior priests left into the temple ; apparently they had grown bored of the conversation .
tr	4	They had wooden beds with feather mattresses , chamber pots , desks , and small , unadorned closets .
tr	1	And Gunnar ... he did not even want to think about Gunnar , his best friend and bonded warrior .
tr	4	When the Green Dragon Priests prepare for war , we drink mead like oxen drink water . "
tr	1	And it was true ; the Green Dragons were a warrior order more than a priestly order .
tr	3	The worst thing that could happen to you is a beheading , and I won 't let that happen .
tr	0	" I do have an affinity for the common and the whores among us , " Harald said .
tr	2	" I 'd rather suffer in the cold ... " Harald nodded and kissed her hand .
tr	3	In its sockets there were no eyes , yet Brand felt that it was staring at him .
tr	4	A sense of dread fell over Brand , but he forced himself out of its control .
tr	0	The screaming reached a pinnacle and Brand 's ears began to throb in pain at the volume .
tr	0	It was the end of his life , and all he had to show for it .
tr	2	At the double doors , two towering statues of valkyrie warriors stood guard with stone spears .
tr	0	An attendant slapped Hilda hard across the cheek for talking , and she spat in his face .
tr	3	Finally , the attendant gave up and , together with the other , left the platform .
tr	3	The last thing Brand felt in the material world was the platform giving out beneath his feet .
tr	4	They may have killed the hero who put an end to the power of the dark idol .
tr	0	She was a woman who hated and fought injustice and , above all , held grudges .
tr	3	This was Kai 's first kill of the day , but it almost certainly would not be his last .
tr	0	" It has become a part of me , like an arm or a leg . "
tr	2	He had told her , " You must do this for the sake of our line ! "
tr	4	They were pitiful and wretched , but they were people too ; only people that had no luck .
tr	4	At last he reached the edge : a stone ridge that extended from the nearby mountains .
tr	2	She would not fare well if Antonio , Marshal of the Imperial Guard , found out .
tr	2	Power and insanity was not a good combination , as he learned from the history books .
tr	0	Against the wall was a desk , and behind it sat a man , obviously an augur .
tr	4	Perhaps , among the magi of the south , but maybe not even among them . "
tr	0	Perhaps it was a cloud , but if it was a cloud it was an evil one .
tr	0	And then , in Him , it is the rich and the powerful that will have no hope . "
tr	4	To his great surprise , he removed his hood to reveal a bloody face , scarred beyond human recognition .
tr	2	Perhaps , to all gods ; and perhaps that would break some of the underworld lord 's power .
tr	1	Soon enough the cohort returned , wrangling a steer by its horns after retrieving it from a nearby ranch .
tr	2	The journey to the black cloud took a long half hour off-road through fields of dry , golden wheat .
tr	0	The rolling wheat was gray , and all color was a pale shadow of what it once had been .
tr	0	" A man in a black hood ran after him and I ran back to camp . "
tr	0	The man lowered his hood , and they realized it was not a man at all .
tr	0	A woman stood before them with a thin , pale face and long brown hair tied into a ponytail .
tr	2	And if you strike me down , you will only have yourselves to blame for your doom . "
tr	1	" It could instill respect , " argued Karo , a younger councilor in his thirties .
tr	2	" Gods know that a single piece of furniture from this room would sell for a thousand gold pieces .
tr	1	" A thousand gold pieces is enough for any sane man to do anything , " Antonio said .
tr	0	A pack of urchins bolted past Claudio as they chased a dog , laughing all the way .
tr	4	Inside the grand hall , Claudio realized he was the most humbly dressed of all the partygoers .
tr	1	Claudio said , and froze , biting his lips as he realized that no , he really didn 't .
tr	4	Ten years old , at most , and the son of the most famous legate in the Empire . "
tr	2	A shrill woman 's voice called out , " Someone tried to murder my son ! "
tr	1	-- Library Journal " Ahmed 's debut masterfully paints a world both bright and terrible . "
tr	3	" What do you think that forked sword 'll do against three men 's spears , pup ?
tr	3	The Traditions of the Order say , " A dervish without virtue is less than a beggar . "
tr	2	But he would not know what to do if lost amidst this horde of lewd , impious people .
tr	4	He paid Miri her fee , mumbled his inadequate goodbyes , and herded the boy out onto the street .
tr	2	The boy looked uncomfortable , but he bowed his head and said " Yes , Doctor . "
tr	3	He knew that he needed direction -- he wasn 't so proud that he couldn 't admit that .
tr	3	The girl raised the white rope -- tied with a fat , squarish knot -- to her mouth .
tr	2	A whisking spell , no doubt , used to travel from the location of one object to another .
tr	3	The Yard 's hay training targets stood abandoned now , a few arrows still sticking out of them .
tr	1	During his training he 'd learned to snap any bonds that held him , no matter how well tied .
tr	4	The tirade silenced the dervish , who stood looking down at the magus 's bleeding corpse .
tr	1	He scuffs the dusty ground with his sandal and speaks to me in a worried stutter .
tr	4	More likely they 've done something shameful they don 't want the village to know of .
tr	0	I take off my turban and caftan , make ablution by the stream and say my noon prayers .
tr	0	As I stand there huffing and puffing my eyes land on a small structure thirty yards away .
tr	0	As soon as I have caught my breath a man comes walking out to meet me .
tr	3	I am right about his stink , and I thank God he does not try to embrace me .
tr	0	A straw mat , an old cushion and a battered tea tray are the only furnishings .
tr	3	I remind myself that charity and mercy are our duty to God , and I soften my tone .
tr	2	The words you hear come not from my mouth , and you do not hear them with your ears .
tr	2	We will die , my husband and I , if you will not lend us your skill .
tr	0	She steps from behind the screen , clad now in a black abaya and a mask .
tr	0	The Shaykh hadn 't lied -- there is witchcraft at work here , and I should run from it .
tr	2	God forgive me , it is hard to know or to care when my beloved is gone .
tr	4	Shireen of the ribbing remark , who in quiet moments confessed her love of my learning .
tr	3	I wad cotton and stuff it in my ears to block out the hermit 's screams .
tr	3	Now she saw that it was just another attempt to convince her to break her oath .
tr	2	I will keep my oath , and God piss on the man who tries to stop me . "
tr	4	The curse was awkward in her mouth and she regretted it as soon as she spoke it .
tr	3	" As with so many of the Lodge of God 's Traditions , this is a matter of interpretation .
tr	2	In ambiguous matters such as these , you ought to make some of your own rulings .
tr	2	I 'll see you in the tribunal hall , child , and God willing this will end peacefully . "
tr	0	" Layla bas Layla , seven years ago , you were brought into the Lodge as a student .
tr	2	" ' For God , the whole world is but a footstep , " ' he quoted .
tr	0	" I am twenty years a Shaykh , and you are barely a Dervish , girl .
tr	3	Know that God is the fairest judge and the most doting father ' say the Heavenly Chapters .
tr	1	With every bit of discipline her training had given her , she kept from leaping to his side .
tr	0	Her teacher had recaptured a bit of his bombast , and Layla drew strength from it as she walked .
tr	0	Before an hour had passed , the ceremony was over and she was walking toward the training yard .
tr	0	It was as strange a notion to Layla as when she 'd first read about it .
tr	0	They arrived at the training yard and Layla hoped to Almighty God that her teacher was right .
tr	0	Surely Shaykh Saif would call this a breach of rule and sound an end to the duel .
tr	4	She slapped his face with the flat of her blade for good measure before she cried " Yield ! "
tr	2	Each took one long step back from the other and sank down to sit cross-legged on the packed dirt .
tr	0	A last bit of something careful and thoughtful in Layla seemed to burn and blow away like ash .
tr	3	She bolted through the stunned assembly , out the great double doors , and into the cool night air .
tr	2	" I 'm just sayin ' you don 't need to go through all of this .
tr	3	Still , he 's one of the few folks in the Society that I can stand .
tr	3	This plan would give him another -- better to say a first -- chance at life .
tr	0	Those crusading buffoons think he is at ARMOR headquarters for his annual maintenance , but behold ! "
tr	1	Every time I do it I think about falling into that volcano and waking up ... changed .
tr	0	It 's a hell of a thing , being a changed man in the same old world .
tr	3	We didn 't make this world , but we survive it by going through the motions .
tr	1	Desert Rangers II was the worst script Muhammad had ever read , in Arabic or English .
tr	1	The movie certainly qualified as " Public Insult to Islam " -- a punishable crime in his homeland .
tr	0	In a stroke of luck two years ago , he 'd played a Cuban drug dealer 's henchman .
tr	1	Lately , I am feeling that I am in a video game , " he said in English .
tr	0	Every inch of ground I am gaining is a danger , a ... " -- what was the word ?
tr	4	" Have you , " he asked in English , " been dipping into my stash ? "
tr	2	There was too much going on in his head for him to try and be social .
tr	0	In his daydreams , too , the language 's strange words and phrases had crowded into his brain .
tr	1	An American couple in their twenties was walking by , clearly enjoying the warm April morning .
tr	2	Though he couldn 't say why , he stopped walking and pretended to look in a store window .
tr	0	" Anyway , I had to paint over it to make it show up on camera .
tr	0	A few bucks for a can of gold spray paint and now we got our evil artifact ! "
tr	4	The same smokeless fire voice that had spoken to him at his uncle 's trial all those years ago .
tr	3	Muhammad let go of the bowl with a yelp , but it just floated there in midair .
tr	0	You 'd ask and ask , and all you 'd get back was a look as hard as rocks .
tr	0	Said he took the name 'cause he was " part blessed and part damned , like any man . "
tr	0	Anything ruthless or nasty you might have heard about his gang was probably the plain truth .
tr	4	The widower sheriff of Redemption and his baby boys getting their ears chopped off and force-fed to them ?
tr	3	It wasn 't natural , the things that old man could do with a Navy Colt or a Winchester .
tr	3	A half hour later I found myself lying trussed up on the ground with two teeth knocked out .
tr	1	" Boy , ain 't nothing involving a pistol and Parson Lucifer ever an accident . "
tr	1	" And I guess you make a nice living doing it , don 't you ? "
tr	4	Even way the hell out here , there 's a lot of lives to go around .
tr	3	And I swear to y ' all that a little piece of flint jumped up and cut my bonds .
tr	0	And a boy with a hole in his head was lying where a fast-talking murderer had just stood .
tr	1	He didn 't even flinch when Parson Lucifer spun around and shot him twice in the chest .
tr	3	I ain 't seen what I 'd done to deserve it , to tell the truth .
tr	4	He pointed his long brown trigger finger up at the sky , like he was naming a target .
tr	4	The cry of a younger man , from the days when he 'd let stupid causes use him .
tr	4	He 'd never seen so many people , not even in the vibrant Free Beirut of his childhood .
tr	4	He 'd traveled for two weeks , surviving on little food and an hour 's sleep here and there .
tr	0	Her slender hand on the small of his back , night after night -- this had saved his life .
tr	2	Maybe you could go to her old broads ' tea hour and tell them about your prompts !
tr	2	But Lubna -- brilliant , loving Lubna -- had shown him that this world could hold holiness .
tr	0	But war had taught him how to hang on when there was a real chance of getting home .
tr	2	If I 'm never south of the Green Cross again , it 'll be too fucking soon . "
tr	2	Someone who didn 't give a gods ' damn for my coin just stole something specific from me .
tr	2	If it wasn 't done on your order , it was still done under your roof .
tr	3	He shouted out in pain , then fell to the floor , struggling to catch his breath .
tr	0	With it , the demon can punish her soul the way it did her body . "
tr	3	But when I tried to frighten the boy , I saw that he was only intrigued .
tr	4	I need to know that your fates have been forged together , or I 'll never know peace . "
tr	4	" So we 've done the Amethyst Empress a favor by killing these fools , " Hai Hai said .
tr	3	Susan was shaken from her troubled thoughts by a subtle change in Lieutenant Jacobs ' attitude .
tr	3	This was the computer program 's catch-all whenever it didn 't know what the hell was actually wrong .
tr	0	She had a sudden mental flash of a wasp landing on her arm on a bright sunny day .
tr	2	" Sergeant Timmons , I 'm going to come out and see what I can do .
tr	4	I need to get out of here to go figure out what is wrong , " she explained patiently .
tr	0	I can 't let you out until the board shows all your birds are away . "
tr	3	Susan tried to keep the frustration and sarcasm out of her voice , but it was hard .
tr	3	Susan turned back to look at Jacobs who had resumed his disturbing stare at the computer monitors .
tr	0	asked Jacobs , who had kept his seat , but wasn 't staring at the screen anymore .
tr	2	Jacobs stood suddenly backing away from her with wide eyes and both hands covering his open mouth .
tr	1	Timmons didn 't answer and she visualized him on the other side of the door thinking .
tr	3	Susan climbed to her feet and turned to find Jacobs sitting on the floor against the wall .
tr	0	The light flickered on an off again and again as they stood and unmeasured time passed .
tr	2	The lights flickered on and off as they stood facing each other from across the small vault room .
tr	1	Part I Going Home Chapter 1 - Alive The icy wind whipped dirty grey snow into Nathan 's face .
tr	3	The dirty unkempt man nearest the stove stood slowly with a cunning look on his face .
tr	3	David 's shot hit both the man sitting at the table and the scrawny woman in his lap .
tr	1	Nathan wondered again how his two sons could be so different , and not just in appearance .
tr	2	Nathan started to answer him , but David stood and turned around incredulous , " Why ?
tr	3	" We can 't bury them without tools , and we can 't spare the gas to burn them .
tr	0	We 'll drag them as far away as we can and hope for the best . "
tr	0	A small egg crate in the corner appeared to contain some canned goods and a bag of dried beans .
tr	3	At the bottom David asked Nathan if he wanted to finish them off with the shotgun .
tr	3	Killing was just a chore to him similar to taking out the trash or doing the laundry .
tr	3	Joshua was right about the bodies attracting the wild dogs , but that was not all bad .
tr	4	He bent over to peer after her as a giant blast rocked the house knocking him to the floor .
tr	3	Nathan took a moment to notice how beautiful she was , even at a time like this .
tr	2	Another series of quakes shook the house knocking him to the floor and he heard a crash downstairs .
tr	0	Bethany was the first to break the paralysis by grabbing a suitcase from Nathan 's feet and running downstairs .
tr	4	Nathan threw several other pieces of luggage to the boys and followed Bethany with a duffle bag .
tr	1	Nathan knew adrenaline was running through him now and that he 'd likely be sore if he survived .
tr	2	He turned to go back down the stairs but saw a portable radio on top of a book shelf .
tr	4	He snatched it up and leaped down the stairs three at a time to the ground level .
tr	0	We received a lot of gamma rays in the initial blasts , we can 't afford any more .
tr	0	Nathan saw Bethany and Joshua staring at him with wide eyes in the flickering candle light .
tr	1	An order for all military forces to mobilize and report to their units was transmitted over the open airwaves .
tr	4	He thought they would make it without further sickness as long as they were careful about exposure .
tr	0	Nathan covered his mouth with a wet bandanna and walked upstairs and outside with the shotgun ready before him .
tr	3	The bodies with signs of foul play in their path reminded them that caution was now paramount .
tr	1	Everything was covered in soot including a body hanging from a lamp post by a chain around its neck .
tr	3	He thought it must simply be despair at the idea of living so differently and without hope .
tr	4	In a nearby field behind a field hospital were neat lines composed of hundreds of recent graves .
tr	3	Their time in the hunting shack was warm and restful , but they must not get complacent .
tr	3	Nathan wanted to say something to comfort his son , but didn 't have the words .
tr	1	This section of the road was in a curve with wooded hills rising on both sides of him .
tr	1	They were talking and laughing about something and appeared totally engrossed in doing nothing in particular .
tr	2	" I 'm looking to cross the bridge ; I 'll pay whatever toll you 're asking for . "
tr	3	This shot was followed by two from the M4 with David hitting another man square in the chest .
tr	4	He was almost there before one of the men peered over a car hood with his rifle .
tr	3	The weapon was pointed directly at Nathan , but the man was so surprised that he froze .
tr	0	Another did see him though , and drawing a pistol , fired at Nathan from about ten feet away .
tr	0	Nathan stopped and leaned against one of the cars after gathering up all the men 's weapons .
tr	3	Why didn 't I think that there might be other men at the opposite end of the bridge ?
tr	4	This was the main reason he agreed to the weekly radio broadcasts in the first place .
tr	2	They also wanted to know when this would be over and they could go back to their normal lives .
tr	4	Reggie put on the headphones and pulled his own sheet of paper from his jacket pocket .
tr	2	" Good afternoon , Tim , it 's good to be here and thanks for inviting me back . "
tr	2	No consumption of gasoline , diesel , natural gas , or kerosene is allowed without authorization until further notice .
tr	4	The hours of electricity and public water operation are still limited to six hours per region each day . "
tr	4	I would also ask families that are better off to help their neighbors if there is a need .
tr	4	Reggie decided to hold off on mentioning the threat of seizure by force that the committee was considering .
tr	0	Each eye can produce a plant which could grow as many as eight or more potatoes .
tr	0	At the time , as you know , I was home in Murray for my father 's funeral . "
tr	0	This was not on the agenda , and was a rumor he did not want to encourage .
tr	4	Yes , there were rumors that the Governor suffered a heart attack , but that 's all we know .
tr	3	Others are thinking and asking the same thing so it 's probably best to bring up .
tr	1	" Actually , I think it might take a miracle to prevent it , " said Reggie grimly .
tr	1	The tall thin man in Joshua 's scope slowed to a jog as he saw the bodies .
tr	4	He drew in a deep breath , held it , then let it all out slowly .
tr	1	He saw a tall thin blond man come into view and then stop in his tracks .
tr	4	He saw the tall thin man trying to crawl under one of the cars , bleeding badly .
tr	0	Joshua took a shot at him , but it hit the road behind his churning legs .
tr	0	He went around the other side of the car and saw that the tall man had already bled out .
tr	0	Bethany cleaned and bandaged his wound with care as they waited in the snowy cold ditch for nightfall .
tr	0	Now , he was inexplicably back at it again , but not for the U.S. Army .
tr	4	She lived life with her typical boundless joy , lasting another three years before finally dying last June .
tr	3	He was old , he thought , but at least he wasn 't old and soft .
tr	1	This was no self-delusion , Anderson 's body was slim and muscular , strikingly so given his age .
tr	1	Anderson 's first order of business was to organize the National Guard and Reserve units within the Jackson Purchase .
tr	3	Anderson thought it probably helped that all these units had recently served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
tr	3	Must still be tame , but means they 're part of that group we just dealt with . "
tr	1	" David , Joshua , and I will make a line with me in the middle .
tr	4	" Maybe they aren 't with the others , " whispered Bethany , who moved up near them .
tr	3	" Okay , but if anything goes wrong , you just hit the ground and stay there .
tr	0	Nathan paused again , " And don 't take any chances you don 't have to . "
tr	4	Something made the dog 's ears twitch and it slowly opened its eyes and gazed directly at Bethany .
tr	0	She raised a hand palm out towards her husband and mouthed faintly , " Wait . "
tr	4	After Reggie convinced Anderson to come back on active duty , he in turn did the same with Butch .
tr	4	" Well , as you know I 'm invited to the Council Meetings and allowed to speak first .
tr	4	Everyone nodded , so he pulled out reading glasses from his military uniform pocket and began scanning lists .
tr	3	I know this is difficult to swallow at first , but I recommend we at least hear Butch out .
tr	2	Butch took this as his cue to continue and pulled out a piece of paper from his folder .
tr	1	We can also find support uses for women and non able-bodied men in logistics and transportation roles .
tr	3	We also plan on cutting out much of the ' fluff ' that is normally in military training . "
tr	0	" Our idea was to use the cadets and cadre of the Murray State ROTC Program .
tr	4	Reggie could feel everything unraveling , " Gentlemen , let 's just calm down for a minute .
tr	2	Hell , I might even tell them to throw you out on your sorry ass ! "
tr	1	Reggie had an angry retort on his lips when Frank Simm stood drawing all their attention .
tr	1	" My kids don 't know what 's happened , " said Simm his voice quivering slightly .
tr	2	Janet asked him in a snippy voice , " And just who do you propose should be cut ?
tr	1	John answered without changing his tone or even looking at her , " Frankly , I don 't care .
tr	1	" Don 't you dare say it , " said Anderson , with comprehension suddenly coming upon him .
tr	4	In the end , he didn 't fight the decision because he knew it needed to be done .
tr	4	Bethany saw the frantic yet dead look in her eyes , a look she had seen many times before .
tr	4	The woman turned back to Bethany and the crazy look was almost gone from her eyes .
tr	0	Nathan raced over and pulled Bethany back , but she was straining , furious with anger .
tr	1	" Son , " Nathan began in a quiet voice , " she didn 't mean it .
tr	2	It also meant those guards were less likely to run off , or not show for work .
tr	4	Also , we can 't keep feeding them and us even with the Food Lion , " said Harold .
tr	3	After that , I want to meet with all the guards and staff and tell them my thoughts . "
tr	3	Jim started to say something and then thought better of it , lifting his giant frame off the couch .
tr	2	Jim slid the baton back into his belt and walked out closing the door on his troubled friend .
tr	3	" All right then , " said Harold trying not to let the distress show on his face .
tr	3	Harold almost added that their cooperation was voluntary , but that would be stating the obvious .
tr	1	" We need to close the prison and dispose of the inmates as soon as possible .
tr	0	I want to adhere at least to the semblance of law as much as we can .
tr	4	Also , any inmate serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole will be executed .
tr	3	He was still expecting a flurry of indignant protests , but the room was as still as a crypt .
tr	4	The faces looking back at him largely reflected relief , their breath visible in the cold room .
tr	2	Bobby Wilson , the prison 's doctor , stood up and the room went still again .
tr	0	Do you really think we can do what you ask in a day and a half ? "
tr	2	" Look , I know this is hard and unsavory , but I see no other way .
tr	3	He told the driver to slow to a stop and the trucks behind him did the same .
tr	0	The man was in an Army combat uniform and carried his M4 in the ready position .
tr	1	As far as I know , I am the senior ranking officer on this post . "
tr	0	" Sir , do you mean to say that you are taking away my command ? "
tr	3	Butch let himself relax , thinking that he would not want to go against these men under any circumstance .
tr	3	Harold didn 't much care for it himself , but it was better than the alternative .
tr	2	Bobby had made it sound so nice and peaceful , he thought , like floating away on billowing clouds .
tr	0	Jim moved forward and sat down in a chair leaning in to Harold in a conspiratorial manner .
tr	0	" Boss , " said Jim , " you 're the final authority and can overrule the board .
tr	1	" I hear you boss , but you 're making a big mistake with this one . "
tr	0	Chapter 13 -- Moving Forward Despite his family 's anguish and turmoil , Nathan kept moving forward .
tr	3	" No , Nathan , if you do that they 'll just feel like broken toys .
tr	1	Nathan was thinking of these things as he walked in front of his new larger ' family ' .
tr	4	He turned and signaled everyone to move into the ditch to one side of the road .
tr	0	It was a beautiful clear day and the cool wind in their faces was refreshing rather than uncomfortable .
tr	3	The facilities were vast , solid , and most importantly made to withstand a direct nuclear strike .
tr	2	Reggie took off his coat and opened his shoulder bag , pulling out a binder and notebook .
tr	2	The room got quiet for a moment and then one of the mayors spoke from the back .
tr	3	What we are playing with just isn 't going to work in the long term . "
tr	3	" But that 's not the issue , " said Leslie Mitchell , the Paducah mayor .
tr	0	They also have a larger population , more military resources , and are essentially a dictatorship under Sampson .
tr	4	President Philips walked slowly back up towards the surface , his load much heavier than it was before .
tr	4	Ethan kept to himself except when he came to town for groceries and an occasional meal at the diner .
tr	1	Sampson had invested Ethan with power , not only in intelligence collection , but also in internal security .
tr	4	" Yes , sir , " Ethan cleared his head of scattered thoughts and focused on the information .
tr	3	Sampson considered the dam , and its electricity , everyone 's right and not just that of the JP .
tr	4	The town residents of Hancock weren 't happy with the plan , but understood the need .
tr	1	The voice continued on with little pause or inflection ; Tim was obviously reading from an all-too-familiar script .
tr	3	Should there be technical problems , listen in at this station at exactly 1 PM on subsequent days .
tr	4	" Everyone keep listening and fill me in on whatever I miss , " Harold walked quickly after Jim .
tr	2	" I don 't know , boss , " Jim seemed to be searching for words .
tr	3	Nathan was determined to let them make the first move now that he was in position .
tr	0	Meeks placed a chair across the table from Nathan and then went to stand behind Nathan .
tr	4	A few moments later the door opened again and the one-eyed older man from the wall entered .
tr	2	" Only for the moment , and we promise to treat you well , " said Harold .
tr	3	This man was trying to get to something , but Nathan did not sense any malice .
tr	0	Harold sat back in his chair and rubbed his face with his hands before looking back at Nathan .
tr	3	" That the JP is the only place in this whole damn world that is still sane .
tr	2	You 're so used to dealing with prisoners you don 't know how to act with normal people ! "
tr	2	" I don 't really know what else to say other than I hope you 'll consider .
tr	4	They looked at Harold who insisted on bringing both vehicles even though it meant siphoning gas whenever possible .
tr	1	" What a bunch of optimists I hitched up with , " said Nathan in mock disgust .
tr	1	Finally , having done all he could think of , Nathan lay down beside a dozing Bethany .
tr	3	Not a flag of the U.S. , or even of Kentucky , but of the University of Kentucky Wildcats .
tr	0	The house 's inhabitants watched from a distance and when Joshua waved they had at least waved back .
tr	0	The large dog had quickly become a sort of mascot and a favorite among the prison families ' children .
tr	2	Those radio broadcasts could be coming from anywhere or be a hoax for that matter . "
tr	3	" But he was trying to protect me , " said Bethany with a heavy voice .
tr	3	They had dared to hope , but tried to remain skeptical , not wanting to be let down .
tr	4	Smiles were present , but more and more Nathan noticed long looks and glances his way .
tr	0	They saw it from a rise , and the makeshift camp was fairly impressive in all the wrong ways .
tr	4	There was a well in the ground with a neat and orderly line of people waiting their turn .
tr	3	Nathan noticed a large wooden sign posted to the front of the platform with bright blue painted words .
tr	4	There were also thin metal poles at regular intervals along the main avenue with lights and loudspeakers attached .
tr	4	With a crisp order they all moved back behind the barriers and pointed their weapons at them .
tr	0	" No problem , " said Harold , " but be careful , " he added as an afterthought .
tr	0	" I am Major Nathan Taylor , U.S. Army and I have come home with my family .
tr	2	" My wife , two sons , and about forty others all told , " he said .
tr	0	" Let me go talk to my group and get my family , " Nathan said .
tr	4	" We could stay together , we don 't need the stupid JP , " said Joshua .
tr	0	A dark attractive woman was working on a jigsaw puzzle with a handsome and smiling blond teenager .
tr	2	Captain Johns walked to the middle of the group and said , " Good afternoon , Taylor family .
tr	0	Anderson and Butch shook his hand and then looked at each other before looking back at Nathan .
tr	0	" Go ahead , " Anderson said with a resigned tone and sat back in his chair .
tr	0	" Thank you very much , " Nathan said sarcastically , " Now where to begin .
tr	4	" I want you to be the military governor and commander of the Land Between the Lakes region . "
tr	2	You 're not going to give me a job and then not equip me to do it .
tr	3	Nathan wasn 't sure what that meant exactly , but he decided to let it go for now .
tr	2	Now that he was so close to home , he felt an irrational fear of the unknown .
tr	3	That won 't be enough , but I 'm thinking we 'll grow his ranks pretty quickly . "
tr	3	" You 'll earn it , " said Nathan sternly , " it 's not a gift .
tr	4	They 'll each be assigned either a bridge to guard or a camp to monitor . "
tr	2	Should that service end for any reason , all could be thrown right back out of the JP .
tr	3	From the park they traveled due west on Route 80 through the little town of Hardin .
tr	2	Sampson would also probably rail at him for selling something that he thought belonged equally to all of them .
tr	1	Anderson had learned not to debate right and wrong with Sampson , only to explain how things were .
tr	1	Sampson said these words with obvious distaste , while his aide made a signal to the rear .
tr	1	" General Sampson , I will take this proposal to the council and President Philips . "
tr	1	Sampson let the words hang in the air , and when Anderson still did not respond , continued on .
tr	1	I hear you , but if you change your mind , my offer will still stand .
tr	0	Nathan wasn 't sure what good things Anderson had told him , but he thanked him anyway .
tr	0	Perhaps we should begin with what the problem is and what I can do to help . "
tr	0	Sampson was in all regards a military dictator and had mobilized every available resource to his ends .
tr	4	Nathan wasn 't sure if he had just been insulted or complimented , but decided to continue on .
tr	3	" Why , find out who it is and let us know , " said Reggie matter-of-factly .
tr	0	" Just tell us what you think , Nathan , " said Reggie and smiled calmly .
tr	2	" Well , first of all , " began Nathan , " you may not be looking for someone .
tr	2	Also , you might be looking for several individuals who don 't even know of each other .
tr	3	But ... that would make it harder to identify the individual , wouldn 't it ? "
tr	0	Letting us know , even in a roundabout way , that he knew of our plans was a mistake .
tr	3	Take it for granted from this point forward that whatever is talked about will get to Sampson .
tr	1	" You need someone , an organization actually , in charge of investigating such incidents and claims .
tr	4	They would have to start small with the basics and work toward a fully developed counterintelligence program .
tr	3	It will take time and it will take lots of hard work and patience on your part . "
tr	2	" So , a few weeks of your help is not going to solve the problem ? "
tr	0	Reggie turned back at Nathan , " That is a very good recommendation , thank you .
tr	4	" When we 're ready , we cut off all their electricity and there will be war . "
tr	3	He said this without any emotion and Nathan knew it wasn 't simply boasting , but reality .
tr	2	That really only leave 's one obvious answer of how the information was passed to him . "
tr	3	He lived that way and didn 't question the purpose of it all ... until recently .
tr	1	It was a rocky road , and not one Brazen accepted willingly ; but Noni could be very convincing .
tr	3	He could accept that they took a scourge on honest people and at least controlled it .
tr	3	The Brothers continued to accept the " payment " for protection , but in other forms such as gasoline .
tr	3	They could point to the electricity , but that ran regardless and was at best an unreliable commodity .
tr	4	He had expected many reactions from this man , but affection was not one of them .
tr	2	I 'm going to pray for you and there is nothing you can do to stop me . "
tr	1	He had heard about how well they were performing as trainers for Carter and was not really surprised .
tr	1	Also won 't folks just say they 're being commissioned only because they 're my sons ? "
tr	3	As far as what people think , that 's one reason I want them conducting this mission .
tr	2	All who know them already know better , and those who don 't , soon will after this . "
tr	4	" We 're ready , " said Joshua eagerly , " and we 'll be careful . "
tr	4	" There are three things you need to know about being a leader going in . "
tr	0	" At Fort Bragg I was in a company that actually had three brothers in it .
tr	0	" Exactly right , " said Nathan , " and a good policy it is too .
tr	3	Burke stated that the only thing necessary for evil to triumph was for good men to do nothing .
tr	3	They must have thought that he would be dumb enough to try something against the mayor here .
tr	2	He then nodded to one of the troopers from outside who stationed himself within the front doorway .
tr	1	Brazen responded in his best smartass tone , " You just told us to stay seated , chief . "
tr	4	Brazen expected an angry outburst at least , but the controlled silence was even more disquieting .
tr	3	The rest of his group didn 't look too happy about sitting with Brazen , but did as directed .
tr	0	" You 've come this far , at least hear what we have to say . "
tr	3	" Thank you , Gary , but I think it 's come time for my part in this . "
tr	3	" I know that 's what you want , but you can 't do it . "
tr	2	Brazen sighed , " Do you know why no crime or violence occurs in areas under my control ? "
tr	0	" Mr. Walker , perhaps you should explain exactly what it is you are proposing . "
tr	0	" It makes sense if you think about it from a practical standpoint , " said Brazen .
tr	0	I 'm also a realist and understand that the JP could crash and burn at any time .
tr	3	Mitchell got up to follow but Reggie didn 't move , he just sat there staring at Brazen fixedly .
tr	1	" Sir , I 've done some bad things in my life , things I 'm not proud of .
tr	1	Not against my will , I 'm the County Executive , this is my business . "
tr	2	Brazen briefly thought how ironic it would be for him to be shot and killed here now .
tr	3	" That 's what I told them , " said Jim , " but they seem serious about it .
tr	0	" Frankly , I don 't know , " said John taking a few ragged breathes .
tr	0	His mind started going through the conversation he would have with Philips when he noticed Harold 's stricken look .
tr	3	" Meanwhile put all the units on alert , but don 't tell them why yet . "
tr	4	Nathan meanwhile moved into an office where he called General Anderson first and told him the situation .
tr	4	Any and all questions regarding this statement should be directed to your local government officials . "
tr	1	" ' Now , friends , I know this is disheartening , but I ask everyone to remain calm .
tr	3	' After all , it wasn 't too long ago that our forefathers lived their entire lives without electricity .
tr	2	People were looking for Reynolds , convinced he had more information he wasn 't giving out .
tr	2	" Yes , Colonel Walker , that was the silver lining to this particular cloud I suppose .
tr	3	It was somehow encouraging to think that the weight of everything wasn 't squarely on his shoulders .
tr	1	You can see and know it 's coming , but nothing is going to make it hurt less . "
tr	3	To Ethan , that was just the cat 's meow and made all the effort and time worth it .
tr	3	Knowing this about himself did not cause Ethan to want to change anything about his character .
tr	4	" They 're without many trained technicians and electricians , and of course replacement parts are an issue . "
tr	3	Ethan felt the enormity of the moment upon him and something akin to a physical rush .
tr	3	It 's not our fault they cannot properly manage the great responsibility given to them in the dam .
tr	0	Ethan started to say something but Sampson turned away and continued walking , calling back over his shoulder .
tr	0	He swore in disgust as much at what he was looking at as at his own lack of planning .
tr	1	The JP had to array its forces in order to respond to any incursion along the entire southern border .
tr	0	" Well , maybe I do at that , " he said as a thought came to him .
tr	1	Make one trip up and down and then back to me , do you understand ? "
tr	3	" I understand , " said Billy while pulling out his map to study the return route .
tr	3	With any luck , they 're not going to try to depart for another day , maybe two . "
tr	4	Joshua was in love with the rifles and wanted to fire one , but the ammo was too scarce .
tr	2	Joshua looked back though the binoculars and saw men lining up in front of the boats in formations .
tr	2	He and Beau had gotten in lots of trouble over the years , but nothing too serious .
tr	4	If Beau remembered correctly , those monsters burned something like 30 gallons of fuel per hour simply idling .
tr	0	Nathan would be happy if Captain Green could only slow the armada and give them time .
tr	0	As far as guarding against an approach on the other lake , Nathan decided against it completely .
tr	0	If they want to take the dam , they have to land troops and approach from land .
tr	2	" I 'm not doing you any favors , you 'll have plenty to do , " said Jim .
tr	2	Just hold them off for a while , and I 'll try to get you some help . "
tr	0	" Yes , sir , " said the private , who saluted and then ran off at a lope .
tr	2	" They 're all in disarray from the tornadoes , maybe not for long , but for now .
tr	1	" First , your unit will conduct this mission , after all , you are in the military .
tr	2	And third , we have a very narrow window of opportunity to do something about them . "
tr	4	Anderson paused and gazed each of them in the eye allowed his heart rate to slow .
tr	3	That should start a fire and also set off the tank rounds in the ammo compartments . "
tr	3	Life had been hard and filled with disappointment , but things were starting to look up .
tr	3	He was so jittery with excitement that it felt like electricity was coursing through his body .
tr	3	It hadn 't been too difficult for a handyman like Walter to get into the JP .
tr	2	He was cold and hungry from days of sleeping outdoors and hiding , but it was almost over .
tr	4	Walter looked both ways and then crossed the street casually walking to the side of the house .
tr	4	He was lucky , luckier than probably about ten of his men , he noticed with dismay .
tr	0	A medic ran over to him , but Jim waved the man away saying he was alright .
tr	3	We tried to stop the ships , honestly sir , but they just kept going . "
tr	4	A moment later the turret turned their direction with an electric pneumatic whine before it stopped .
tr	2	He would later swear he actually saw the shell 's stabilizing fins deploy while in flight .
tr	3	He got plenty of attention from college scouts , but most thought he was too small .
tr	4	Beau found by looking through the range finder and then moving the joystick he could move the turret .
tr	0	He also found a selector switch and changed it from " main gun " to " coaxial " .
tr	4	He looked back toward his men and saw that they were getting control of the remaining prisoners .
tr	4	David saw several levers and switches and two large crank flywheels , one larger than the other .
tr	4	He read the dusty directions again in the dim light and pushed the main lever upward .
tr	4	He could hear them mumbling and asking among themselves what he was doing , but he ignored them .
tr	0	He saw the open lock , into which all the water was rushing in a wild and chaotic display .
tr	0	Nathan found the sight was making him physically nauseous , and he had to turn away .
tr	4	Something made Nathan look over at the dam , its concrete surface and edges torn and wrecked .
tr	4	Their course would bring them to the southern edge of the Land Between the Lakes Park .
tr	1	They only saw lone vehicles occasionally on the single major highway running from Tennessee north into LBL .
tr	3	Joshua noticed that the lake seemed much shallower than normal with a stronger current to the north .
tr	3	Finding a path in the under growth where briars tugged at their clothing with every step was difficult .
tr	4	He could very easily get killed by friendly troops after surviving weeks in the heart of enemy territory .
tr	3	" But I 'll tell everything to your commander if you would just take me to him . "
tr	3	He didn 't want that thought to occur , and he had never been good at lying .
tr	3	Everyone 's pretty tense after the attacks to the north and with what happened to President Phillips .
tr	1	" They were only doing their job , and doing it quite well I might add . "
tr	4	" Were you supposed to send a message back letting him know if you were successful or not ? "
tr	1	Nathan turned back , his mask gone , fury pouring out of his eyes , " Hang him !
tr	0	" You can call me Amy , " she said with a smile , patting his hand .
tr	4	The windows were open to bright sunlight and there was a light breeze blowing the curtains gently .
tr	4	" Yes , sir , " said Beau , not sure if he believed what he was hearing .
tr	1	" Yes , " answered Anderson , " you 're now the JP 's one and only tank commander .
tr	1	" Thank you sir , but you know I don 't know anything about tanks . "
tr	3	" You know enough son , and that 's exactly the sort of attitude I 've been talking about .
tr	1	If you can 't have confidence in yourself , then have confidence in my confidence in you .
tr	0	Now let 's talk about that mad ass one man assault you conducted on a tank .
tr	0	He was an aggressive and dynamic leader in an age when everyone was cautious and methodical .
tr	2	He was on a horse trying to rally his fleeing troops and took a bullet through his hand .
tr	0	From that point forward he was no longer timid and cautious , he was clearly different .
tr	2	I know it sounds corny , but it 's happened before , just look at Sherman . "
tr	1	So much for resting up , thought Beau as he slowly swung his legs out of bed .
tr	3	Once the fear and uncertainty of the threat ended , negative talk started circulating about David 's actions .
tr	1	" True enough , " said Nathan wondering if Anderson was thinking of his deceased wife .
tr	2	You saved our bacon here and without you I 'm not sure what we would have done .
tr	3	I know you will , but I want us to mutually respect and trust one another .
tr	2	" Do I even want to know how you got him to give up that information ? "
tr	1	We also need you to catch Sampson 's spies and assassins as fast as possible . "
tr	3	" All good questions that I don 't have the answer to yet , " said Anderson .
tr	3	The world may be dead he thought , but those satellites up in orbit just keep on trucking .
tr	3	This man had the daunting task of collecting all the intelligence reports and providing the information to Ethan .
tr	0	" Actually yes , sir , and I 'm afraid it isn 't good , " said Ethan .
tr	3	Barring that , we wanted to at least destroy it so the enemy couldn 't use it .
tr	0	In that regard it is a partial success , and we have certainly destroyed many of their troops .
tr	1	" Are we still going forward with our other surprise attack given our recent setbacks ? "
tr	0	Sampson rubbed his chin and looked at Ethan with what Ethan thought might be a suspicious look .
tr	1	I 'm sick of sitting in the rear and watching cowardly subordinates piss away my victories . "
tr	1	I envision them having law enforcement authority , but also counterintelligence capabilities , similar to the FBI .
tr	1	A significant amount of power will reside with one organization and by default with this organization 's leader .
tr	2	Several men and women still stood in the mayor 's office not sure what to do .
tr	4	asked a sheriff 's deputy who happened to be in the building when the old man stormed in .
tr	4	They looked at him like he had lost his senses before protesting in louder and louder voices .
tr	0	The WTR force continued to make a hasty withdrawal , loading the barges while sustaining heavy casualties .
tr	3	Death is a certainty to all , it is what we do until then that defines our character .
tr	4	" You are the lost sheep and God is fanatical and relentless in pursuing those who are His .
tr	1	Brazen was silent for a moment and then said , " No , I 'm not ready .
tr	2	I suggest you quit playing around and fooling yourself before you get a bunch of people killed .
tr	3	He also wanted to protect the secrecy of the assault team 's position until the last minute .
tr	3	A moment later the rest of the support team began firing with their rifles and squad automatic weapons .
tr	3	He also told them to stay in a line and take out everything in their path .
tr	3	He attempted to pull his rifle up to shoot , but he didn 't have a chance .
tr	4	He was getting conflicting reports from every direction and everyone seemed to have lost their minds .
tr	3	What didn 't make sense was the sound of fighting that was coming from their rear .
tr	1	In disgust , Sampson threw down his glasses and stormed out of the tent to assess the situation himself .
tr	3	He went on talking about crushing the JP now that they had made the mistake of standing and fighting .
tr	4	He started to stop another soldier when one of his aides finally returned and grabbed Sampson by the arm .
tr	1	" It 's up ahead , but I 'm afraid you 've run out of time . "
tr	0	He looked around and saw the squad of soldiers in a circle around them facing outwards with their weapons .
tr	4	He saw that discipline and cohesion had broken down in the euphoria of victory following their earlier intense fear .
tr	1	He continued to hear the disquieting sounds of individual shots that could only mean one thing .
tr	3	I hope it doesn 't come to that , but I fear it will at first .
tr	2	He took control of the prisoners and continued on his mission with the prisoners in tow .
tr	1	He would resign his post to Butch until an official investigation could be conducted into his army 's actions .
tr	3	" I apologize , but I must inform you that General Sampson died at the Battle of Fulton .
tr	3	" I appreciate your tact and not wanting to humiliate us , but we should talk straight here .
tr	0	I again ask you to consider that the war was not against the WTR , but against General Sampson .
tr	4	" If the war is to be over , then it is to be over for everyone . "
tr	4	" It is also good to hear that you are holding free and democratic elections , " said Reggie .
tr	1	Whatever you ask , I promise to do it , if it is within my power . "
tr	1	" Yes , you are right , it was presumptuous for me to ask such a thing .
tr	4	His plans were progressing exactly as planned and he was one step closer to his ultimate objective .
tr	4	That campaign seemed to have miraculously broken the WTR 's back and won the war in one swift stroke .
tr	4	" They seem to have a good competent leader now from what I hear , " commented Harold .
tr	4	The water level of the lakes finally reached a point where it could turn the turbines and create electricity .
tr	4	If they needed the lock doors to open , they could deal with that issue later .
tr	3	As it was , it would still take time to raise the water back to normal level .
tr	0	Just then they heard the grinding noise again which must be the dam door being closed , thought Harold .
tr	4	They then heard the grinding noise again and Harold wondered if they were trying another door .
tr	1	He noticed Harold glaring at him with his one good eye and stopped , his smile vanishing .
tr	0	Anderson could tell right away that Beau was upset about something and he probably knew why .
tr	2	" Son , you have no reason to follow my path , " said Anderson compassionately .
tr	4	Hell , there wouldn 't even have been an army to fight back if it weren 't for you .
tr	1	" First of all , " said Anderson , " they didn 't force me into anything .
tr	0	As a matter of fact , most people disappoint me as much as I disappoint myself .
tr	2	I took you on , and gave you responsibility and opportunity because I thought you were worth it .
tr	4	I 've had the opportunity to experience life to its fullest and understand how precious and precarious it is .
tr	1	It made no difference to him that his nation was wrong to ask his life of him .
tr	1	" You 're still not leaving me much choice , " said Beau with a slight smile .
tr	3	They are also working to solidify the existing court system to give it more permanent authority . "
tr	2	" I just wanted to again say how very proud I am to be one of you today .
tr	1	Full identification of this individual will be one of the primary objectives of the above operation .
tr	4	Sir , I will continue to keep you informed of the above situations as they develop .
tr	3	Following the attacks , the nuclear fallout drifted east with the prevailing winds and weather patterns .
tr	1	In short , the situation outside the JP , especially in high population density areas , is dire .
tr	4	Respectfully , ORIGINAL SIGNED Brigadier General Nathan Taylor Chapter 16 -- Farewell The last month was difficult for Reggie .
tr	0	He looked down at the first row and saw friends and colleagues smiling back at him .
tr	3	That quote was more apt and fitting now , and Reggie decided on a whim to use it .
tr	4	Reggie heard grumbles and some words of anger , but saw Brazen 's encouraging smile and continued on .
tr	1	" I know some will think my remarks quaint , but civility and courtesy are important .
tr	1	Maybe even a unique thing , a light on a hill , but it is fragile still .
tr	4	Reggie pulled out the piece of wrinkled paper Brazen had given him and unfolded it carefully .
tr	2	Reggie paused and looked out over the crowds before looking down at the quote and continuing .
tr	4	" Would you like anything while it is being prepared , perhaps some fresh bread with butter ? "
tr	0	Ethan already had plans in the works and he almost always got what he wanted given time .
tr	1	Everyday casters could touch the four pillars , Earth , Fire , Air , and Water .
tr	1	Life was far beyond anyone 's grasp , as they discovered so disastrously in the Shadow Wars .
tr	1	It was a thin , frail light , as if it were too weak to finish the day .
tr	4	The black thought lowered his mood and with it his eyebrows descended over his grey eyes .
tr	4	And no doubt he means me and the others to be the ones killed in the process .
tr	4	He 'd seen a number of creatures roaming through the mountains , former pets and emboldened predators alike .
tr	1	One symbol , surrounded by a ring , carved into stone underneath the dust of Savana 's pillar .
tr	3	Does it still count as a battlefield conquest if the King has already given them to his sons ?
tr	4	Hopefully we will have found the Falcon and left this place long before she comes of age .
tr	3	They should just be glad that the beasts set loose in the Invasion stay in the mountains !
tr	2	I 'm sure he 's nobody , and he 'll soon be on his way . "
tr	4	she tried again , more serious this time , but he only shrugged and looked away .
tr	0	She was taken aback , but kept her voice as casual as she could , forcing an apologetic grin .
tr	0	He is too clean to be a merchant 's guard , perhaps he 's run away ?
tr	1	The conversation returned to his travels , and if it was mundane Elaina didn 't notice .
tr	2	" Watch the ground , or you 'll be looking at it much closer than you planned .
tr	0	His accusing stare felt hot , but she cut off his protest with a sharp shake of her head .
tr	4	After a few tense minutes , Elaina sighed and let the tension out of the bow .
tr	3	It 's how to tell her that is the question , and what to do with the boy .
tr	3	It was pleasant to talk about home , but he was careful not to reveal too much .
tr	0	Even though he was absolutely serious , it was an absurd thing for any one man to say .
tr	4	His eyes , so like Elaina 's with motes of gold in brown like warm honey , were inscrutable .
tr	0	Any man could be killed for saying what he said , for being accused of saying it .
tr	3	The inscription was still clear though , all loops and curls and thick lines that trailed into nothing .
tr	3	And we have more important things to discuss than the hinge at the bottom of my wardrobe .
tr	4	I haven 't done more than a petty caster since you came to me , child . "
tr	3	When he whirled about to face the two of them Landon took a startled step back .
tr	3	Always will the Truth be on my lips -- soon that will be my oath , too .
tr	1	That was either terribly insightful , or a completely ridiculous , and I am not sure which .
tr	1	Their " spirit " or " being " is made up of a pattern of the pillars .
tr	4	She felt the worried frown furrow her forehead , but couldn 't make it go away .
tr	4	The feeling was like remembering the taste of your favorite food just before you tasted it again .
tr	3	With a gasp , she wrenched out of its embrace , pulling away but not letting go .
tr	0	A breath of wind rustling through the forest was as loud as a gale to her ears .
tr	4	She peered around the clearing with new eyes , and the faintest hints of webs glittered at her .
tr	3	It is better to be cautious with your power than to become worse than those you fight against . "
tr	0	From then on Landon muttered and glared and backed away dramatically every time she cast a web .
tr	1	It wasn 't as if I tried to lose the web -- and I did apologize .
tr	3	Light looked dreadfully tricky with Air and Fire all together , but that had at least felt learnable .
tr	2	" When you 're strong enough , I 'll show you what to cast to bind yours to you .
tr	4	Prophecies are for key moments , like whirlpools that every current leads to , one way or another .
tr	0	It was never a skill of mine -- that is about as far as I understand it . "
tr	2	" There are ways to hide the connection , if you know what to look for . "
tr	0	When he heard Landon , he snatched his pipe from his lips to squint at her .
tr	4	" You know the pillars help casters stay well , but they do even more for us . "
tr	4	She 'd never admit it to a soul , but storms like these made her actually wish for land .
tr	0	It had faded -- he was no longer a young man -- but it was still plain .
tr	1	If it hadn 't been so terribly important , Elaina would have thrown up her hands and given up .
tr	4	Every few days the little house was visited by a guest of an entirely different sort .
tr	3	From there , it could not be convinced to back out until Elaina patted the monstrous snout .
tr	4	She supposed her attitude would be more like Landon 's if they wanted to eat her .
tr	2	It would be a poor payment to your family if they never heard from you again . "
tr	1	" Anything you like , only no burning -- we do not need the smoke . "
tr	4	If I 'm tired , he must be exhausted , she thought , suddenly ashamed of herself .
tr	3	I 'd thank you not to try any time soon , we 're fugitives , after all . "
tr	1	" Yes , it is a strange business , as I said , and a dangerous one .
tr	2	It really isn 't casting at all ... " Here he trailed off , suddenly very still .
tr	3	One of them knows better than to tell a woman what to wear , she thought .
tr	1	She 'd put it on in the morning -- there was no need to sleep in the stinking thing .
tr	3	That would be perfect -- the exact opposite of what we do now : starving and marching .
tr	4	Somehow , banishing was utterly different than killing , even if the result was the same .
tr	3	When Landon came trotting back with the lifeless body , Elaina couldn 't barely stand to look at it .
tr	3	Truth , what would it do to me if I did that to something greater than a rabbit ?
tr	2	He sighed and scanned the ground for the burrows of snow voles or the tracks of mountain fox .
tr	3	He tried to keep the doubt out of his voice , but it didn 't quite work .
tr	4	Elaina had spent the whole first week looking at him sideways as if he were a puzzle .
tr	4	She sounded more tired than alarmed , but Landon felt a thrill of unease wriggle up his spine .
tr	1	But anyone behind us can only come in one man at a time , if they find this niche .
tr	0	Elaina and Landon shared an incredulous look , but the calm in his voice eased Landon 's fears .
tr	4	The thin snow must have melted , leaving the last of the fall flowers visible in the grass .
tr	4	In the stillness he could hear the cheerful sound of water trickling down the rocks into the pool .
tr	2	When he got closer to the pool he yanked off his boots and splashed right in .
tr	3	Crouching a bit in the water , it was just the right height to shave by .
tr	3	I hear its better in the valleys of the mountains than up in the northern plains .
tr	4	" We 're going to need supplies if we mean to face the winter up here . "
tr	2	If something happens , don 't wait , and whatever you do , don 't come back .
tr	1	she asked anxiously , " All these warnings ... " " Just in case , " he assured her .
tr	1	A stooped old man had taken his place , white hair trailing down his back : his disguise .
tr	0	If they really know , you 'd only give them exactly what they want : you .
tr	3	Landon didn 't know if that was because she was angry or just if there was nothing to tell .
tr	1	The stone crashed and bounced loudly down the mountainside until he heard it crunch into soft snow .
tr	4	She clenched her jaw and refused to blink so the tears just glistened in her eyes but never fell .
tr	2	" I saw smoke to the south -- a village or a farmhouse , most likely .
tr	3	" We 're just going to have to chance it , " Landon said , scowling at the heights .
tr	3	" Walk fast , but don 't run -- that would draw even more attention . "
tr	3	That could have been our last chance to stay ahead of them , she thought bitterly .
tr	0	As soon as he did , the hermit had a fit , wheezing and coughing in the thin sunlight .
tr	0	A man in all black stepped forward and grabbed him around the neck with one enormous hand .
tr	2	Technically , he hadn 't opened the door to anyone ... " How long ago ? "
tr	4	In the distance , he could see the people of this little village fleeing into the tall grass .
tr	4	They were surrounded by armed men in black coats , dressed exactly as Landon described -- Watchers .
tr	2	Landon circled her sword drawn , as grim as death , but the guard paid him no mind .
tr	2	If they are as good as is said , they don 't need to mind Landon .
tr	1	A final rider in dark grey galloped toward them , raising a thin streamer of dust through the grass .
tr	1	It surprised her how normal he looked , this invading conqueror and Empire builder , this murderer .
tr	0	He had said that to touch it was death , and his own death proved him right .
tr	1	She groaned , bringing Landon back to her side , but she couldn 't stand any longer .
tr	2	Elaina couldn 't hold her head up to watch , but she could still hear the cool reply .
tr	1	Thunder rolled around them , never truly ending , an ominous drumbeat of ruin and death .
tr	3	Landon felt sick , and it had nothing to do with the buckling of the earth .
tr	3	The Watchers were startled to see him acting the doorman , but only stuttered a moment .
tr	4	She panted from the effort of holding him there , her eyebrows drawn into an angry scowl .
tr	2	A child throwing a tantrum with the pillars could well kill him , and then who could save Landon ?
tr	1	Here this chit who had stolen his son stood side by side with his most despised enemy .
tr	0	That was how it used to be anyway , but much had changed since the Invasion .
tr	2	Elaina had some doubt as to whether she could have stood up to him , pillars or no .
tr	0	A few months ago all that gold and the stones would have made her jaw drop , Elaina knew .
tr	3	Plan too far ahead and you 'll fall over the first stone while thinking about the tenth .
tr	2	Things have a way of going wrong if a person lives long enough , travel or no .
tr	2	The destruction of the Orb had not gone well for the local stocks of food and water .
tr	3	If the villagers don 't like how it turns out , they can just redo it themselves .
tr	2	There were openings for doors and windows and rafters across the top to fix thatch to .
tr	4	The matron 's chin trembled a bit with her voice , and tears filled her brown eyes .
tr	0	Could any soul be so twisted and false that it would create a such a place ?
tr	4	There is no shame in needing a few extra hands to deal with that , certainly .
tr	3	That was the only way to do anything to Bloodstone : alter it with pure Flame .
tr	0	Kicking with all her strength , she tried to fight free of the hands that held her .
tr	3	Though I doubt I 'll get the chance to test that , with these two not two spans away .
tr	2	" Please do not try to overpower us again , we do not want to hurt you . "
tr	4	They seemed to know exactly what she meant : what have you done to my power .
tr	2	So long as you are connected by the stone to any of our kind , your power is gone .
tr	4	And chained to her as they were , there had to be many , many ways .
tr	4	They weren 't standing at tense attention as they had been before , she was no longer a threat .
tr	4	They were sent alone on the most dangerous , impossible missions in her service , and many died .
tr	0	It felt as though lightning had run up her arms and struck her through the heart .
tr	1	There was only pain , exquisite pain that did not numb with time , but blossomed in her mind .
tr	2	She was older , yet still a child , on a field of dead men and dying .
tr	0	He handed her and the other boy the swords with his last words on his lips .
tr	2	As inconvenient as she could be , he was still not looking forward to that day .
tr	2	That was something he knew of , only his chains were not of stone , but blood .
tr	3	She showed no respect to anyone with authority , but remained unfailingly polite to anyone without .
tr	3	It was similar to the scar on Corin 's arm inflicted by her teeth that first day .
tr	4	Feeding her was a trial -- they trying to sustain her , she trying to choke or starve herself .
tr	1	An flash of white light on the horizon , and a world of pain and fear and loneliness .
tr	3	Being cold to the bone with no way to get warm , though , that was a nightmare .
tr	2	I am NOT going to ask to go inside , no matter how much I want to .
tr	2	" This would be a poor time to burn the wagon with a loose ember . "
tr	3	" Then there are the birds you want to train to hunt , the proud , dangerous birds .
tr	3	The only sound was the wind against the tent , sneaking bitterly cold drafts around the seams .
tr	0	And , more importantly , what actions are forbidden to a man who carries fate on his shoulders ?
tr	1	This will be her warning -- I am a fair man , I will warn her .
tr	2	" You are a fool , Firstborn , yet you prance about like a king ! "
tr	4	Kill me , and your world dies because of you , if your prophesies are true .
tr	2	It was normally used for the interrogation of captured spies or scouts -- the red did not show blood .
tr	3	But if he tried anything , this much and more would be Sarina 's without doubt .
tr	2	Many suddenly thought of something to do on the other side of the encampment or beyond .
tr	4	They had been there often enough that she knew all the men assigned to the red tent .
tr	3	They were actually almost friendly , with her so polite it was hard for them not to be .
tr	2	She stood on two wooden blocks nailed into the boards , leaning back against the tilted surface .
tr	3	The Firstborn was that sort of man , to lose his head in the pleasure of it .
tr	3	" I have enjoyed watching you struggle , sparrow , but for this you must stay very still .
tr	3	To touch one of the Brothers that way was an assault ; it stripped the Firstborn of the Elements .
tr	1	She will bear that scar forever , to remind her of the cost of rash words . "
tr	4	He was right where he should be in her head , but was she sure he was a Watcher ?
tr	3	She was too tired to do anything at all with it , but to hold it !
tr	0	He pushed the thought of what was behind him back into a dark corner of his mind .
tr	4	There only a camisole underneath , and it had ridden up quite high as she straddled the horse .
tr	3	And she most definitely wanted their passing to be made with as little attention as possible .
tr	4	She was grateful for the excuse to lean into him , with her knees bending like broken reeds .
tr	2	The sort of problem ... well , the sort you know when you 've got it , eh ?
tr	3	Still , she did not want to be out here any longer than they had to be .
tr	3	But Truth , it feels so good to be free of that weight around my neck !
tr	0	Without doubt , if anyone came after her with a collar again she would kill them in a blink .
tr	3	A single candle stood on a windowsill , lighting the face that looked out at them .
tr	0	Her head was lolling about -- she wouldn 't be awake much longer if she was at all .
tr	4	" You may set her on the chair there , I don 't mind the mess . "
tr	4	So you 've just got in and the Lady 's feeling the ride , is it ?
tr	4	At any rate , she will never allow herself to be trapped like that again . "
tr	4	I do not think things would have ended well for us if you had not been here .
tr	4	CHAPTER 21 The Name Thanking their host again , they let themselves be herded back into the night .
tr	0	Elaina cast a gentle glow around them -- what a joy to use the pillars again !
tr	4	She was extremely glad the caster had mended the chafing from that along with everything else .
tr	1	Even as he spoke , his head was constantly turning , scanning the night for a threat .
tr	2	" Do you wish to try the web now , or do you need to wait ?
tr	1	One glance was enough to convince her that her companion knew exactly what she was thinking .
tr	4	Elaina woke up to find she was still sprawled awkwardly across the coverlet of the scratchy old bed .
tr	4	Their dinner started to smell delicious in a very short amount of time , making Elaina 's stomach rumble .
tr	0	She cast a sideways glance at Cade , who apparently did not think the food was done .
tr	0	She thought she saw one eyebrow twitch upward at that and a blush spread across her face .
tr	4	He is the man who force fed her multiple times a day for many , many days .
tr	0	He had no idea what it was -- and last night 's guess hadn 't helped at all .
tr	4	Elaina jumped and Cade spun , black sword out to face the wall of trees to the left .
tr	0	So the man had Earth at the least , and the woman had Air and Earth and Water .
tr	0	Elaina said at last , using the name she and Cade had agreed on in advance .
tr	4	" Well , you are welcome to stay here , or to travel with us if you wish . "
tr	4	All the buildings are painted every color of the rainbow , with arches and spires like lace .
tr	3	This wasn 't the time to make anything of it , either : Darin might decide to interfere .
tr	4	" Come now , you have never sat so close to me before -- Darin frightened you .
tr	2	His open curiosity forced her to go on , and Elaina hit on it at last .
tr	2	Well , I 'm not the sort of man to go merrily on my way , little sorceress . "
tr	0	Vaguely , Elaina saw her arms rise to push him away , but without any strength .
tr	1	It was like watching a nightmare , everything moving slowly , dimly , outside her control .
tr	0	Cade explained , " When I heard a scream I came as quickly as I could .
tr	0	" You 'll make more than that in a season , using them as brood mares . "
tr	2	But you don 't have time to wait a season and breed horses , do you ? "
tr	3	" So it 's not just the horses that have had a bad way of it . "
tr	0	It is no surprise they 'd treat a man as badly , or a woman . "
tr	0	A man who did it to a dog would have , for that , or even a rat .
tr	3	Drifting into the crowd , Cade made his way north through the city to the port .
tr	3	the other man wailed , " All that I paid to get you this job gone for naught ! "
tr	3	He said , settling onto a stool beside the table with a tired slump to his shoulders .
tr	4	" If they have these at the gates , I 've no idea how we 'll ever get out .
tr	4	" There 'd be the risk of ambush if it fell into the wrong hands . "
tr	1	Bookstores always had parchment , quills , and ink in addition to any volumes they 'd invested in .
tr	3	Setting it all on the table , he hesitated , " My handwriting is distinctive . "
tr	3	What is the West without the East to balance it , what is the right hand without the left ?
tr	4	There was a short struggle and the sound of fabric rustling , then there was a long pause .
tr	0	Just when he was about to ask if he might turn back around , she spoke again .
tr	2	" Don 't look , but I don 't think this is going to work . "
tr	0	After all , who would try to rob a vagabond and dock rat in the dim alleyways ?
tr	0	And if anyone tried that , who would succeed in robbing a Guardian and a Watcher ?
tr	0	At the top of the ramp , a man rose up to block their way aboard .
tr	1	" This is a ship of trade , not of passengers -- there are no cabins .
tr	3	Her top was just as vibrantly yellow , but that wasn 't its most startling feature .
tr	3	" There are inspectors at the mouth of the harbor -- they would be happy to find this . "
tr	1	" So the stars speak tonight , " he resigned himself to his orders , " we must follow .
tr	4	" Never mind that , lad , always enough room at the table for a few more friends .
tr	2	I should sooner have given my life protecting a woman , but I stood by and watched .
tr	4	And wake me from my nightmares -- the ones that you won 't be in . "
tr	1	She was even making her dress look like a dress again , instead of a shapeless sack .
tr	4	Cade wondered what these simple people would think if they knew exactly who the imposter newlyweds were .
tr	1	" On the contrary , sir , our thanks for making our walk that much shorter . "
tr	0	She thought you a prince , and Truth only knows what she thought of me , " declared Elaina .
tr	3	It is just that sort of tone that would dissuade me from ever taking a wife .
tr	2	Well , they will never fit on so small a boat as this , will they ?
tr	3	The barren streets ran back and forth through the buildings , all stepping down to the harbor below .
tr	3	He didn 't really want to speak of it , but some part of him wanted her to know .
tr	2	" Would you like to go see the wharf -- or what 's left of it ? "
tr	2	" Very well ... " he said at last when she still wouldn 't look at him .
tr	4	" The water 's not cold , " he assured her as he skinned his shirt over his head .
tr	1	She was staring at him open-mouthed and blushing at his state of undress , he noticed .
tr	1	Wishing for a moment that she was not quite as stubborn as she was , Cade shrugged .
tr	4	Cade tore his eyes from the smooth curve of her ankles to look up at her face .
tr	4	She protested , throwing one elbow over the lip of the wall for a better grip .
tr	2	" It 's okay to let go now , the rock isn 't going anywhere . "
tr	0	The Link was as thin and weak as the sound of a single violin from a high tower .
tr	1	he shouted , and the walls and cliffs sent his voice chasing itself off the stones .
tr	2	To read and write , to cook , to chop wood ... everything but swimming . "
tr	3	Cade smiled at the thought , but said , " You can 't rebuild everything . "
tr	2	Elaina wouldn 't want to go , so he made his way down to the harbor before she woke .
tr	4	Then I need you to take the Pillars away , and don 't let the wave get me . "
tr	4	Turning her attention to the harbor , Elaina took a deep breath and closed her eyes .
tr	2	That was the work of hundreds of men for years , and you 've done it in an hour !
tr	4	She said , and a stiff breeze sprang up to push her back to the pier .
tr	4	CHAPTER 29 The Ship Elaina slid carefully up onto the dock , letting her wonderful boat dissipate .
tr	1	They would die before speaking a false word -- say it 's against the stars or some such .
tr	0	Elaina gave a little shrug and called out , " Who comes , and what is your purpose ? "
tr	3	It wasn 't easy , even with Cade holding the bottom to keep it from twisting around .
tr	4	Elaina did not even get the chance to speak before angry voices erupted in the hallway .
tr	2	Cade knocked softly on the door to their cabin , not wanting to intrude on her privacy .
tr	4	Before he had to try and say something , she cleared her throat and looked away .
tr	3	I swore to protect you and I 'll find a way to keep doing that no matter what . "
tr	4	The last time she had seen that particular couple , they had not been quite so close .
tr	4	Moving from one to the next , she ran her fingers along the silks and pearls .
tr	4	Just as popular were the little mirrors , and in each one she looked over her shoulder .
tr	4	The whole cohort stopped suddenly , and watchful eyes began to wander all over the place .
tr	4	The waves crashed against the cliffs around them as if the sea were conducting a symphony for her .
tr	4	she asked , secretly hoping that her brother wouldn 't have to get married after all .
tr	1	And if I spin my net just right , I might make the catch of a lifetime .
tr	0	Men are all straight lines and sharp angles , always trying to bind curves into their own way .
tr	1	" There 's a fair bit of rumor floating around in the south , for sure .
tr	4	" Don 't put wrinkles on that lovely face for me , " he chuckled , ignoring her protest .
tr	4	She always woke up blushing and yanking her blankets up so he wouldn 't see her in her camisole .
tr	0	He was a tall , blonde young man with a strong jaw and sharp blue eyes .
tr	2	She tried to call to him , or reach out , but her whole body was numb .
tr	3	All at once they stepped from the winding path into the bright light of a clearing .
tr	2	It is strange that so many of the flowers are in full bloom -- all of them , really .
tr	2	The pillars may not work on you , Cade , but they work on her . "
tr	4	She drew a fine chain over her head with the key dangling from it and tossed it to Elaina .
tr	3	She smiled at Elaina , who stood as still as the statues that littered the fragrant garden .
tr	4	She turned to pluck a pale blue blossom from the cascades of them that hung over the courtyard .
tr	3	Plus , all the trouble I went to getting this one to do as I asked .
tr	0	" And that poison was no easy feat -- vinegar is so hard to mix with . "
tr	4	A giggle , " So handsome , so much older , " she sighed at the memory .
tr	1	It was possible that he would break his jaw if he kept grinding his teeth this way .
tr	1	" And you had been doing so well ... " she spun away , his mind spinning with her .
tr	4	Elaina did , judging by the astonished fury he could see in her eyes , even from this far .
tr	2	" You won 't be angry with me if I take you from her , will you ? "
tr	1	Cade forced himself to smile into her lips , if this could save Elaina ... Anything .
tr	1	She 's ready to dismiss everything I 've said and done instead of ignoring this charade ?
tr	0	An insanity that had decided it wanted Elaina dead and would try again when he escaped .
tr	0	He stepped in front of her , and his hands on her shoulders brought her to an unwilling halt .
tr	3	Don 't wonder why or how or what -- just accept it : he wants out .
tr	4	She wouldn 't , and he couldn 't spare a hand from her shoulders to make her .
tr	0	Elaina did not blame him either , couldn 't blame him that his hands shook with anger .
tr	4	I am a betrayer of hope , a deceiver of trust , a murderer of women .
tr	4	Curls of shame seemed to wind their way around her stomach , making her feel ill .
tr	4	He reached down , and she thought he might take the bracelet , but he grabbed only his blankets .
tr	2	Elaina shook , willing herself to watch him go , to not run after him or call his name .
tr	4	Grey eyes studied him as she drew near , not a hint of emotion in her eyes .
tr	3	Riesling got the impression that something was wrong , something other than her mistaking him for a customer .
tr	1	" She is in no danger from me , and I can think of a few others with certainty .
tr	0	Cade returned with a towering stallion that was as dark a black as the night around it .
tr	2	Two against fourteen is not good odds , even if you make it past the arrows .
tr	0	Rylan watched him as he led the way off the hill , slinking in the shadows .
tr	3	It set the group to immediate action , jerking them upright like puppets on a string .
tr	2	They spoke in the common language -- a man 's oath ought to be above question in any tongue .
tr	4	If there is to be no home , what honor is left but to defend the royal line ?
tr	1	If he ever returns , the man will have a difficult time living up to his reputation .
tr	1	Those stuck in the net finished falling at normal speed , gasping and panting for breath .
tr	3	The prince was staring to the southwest the way a man looks at water in a desert .
tr	0	It took hours to truly catch him , even though their geldings were quicker and lighter than his charger .
tr	0	Rylan tensed , reaching to his shoulder for the hilt of his sword as they approached the guard .
tr	2	I 'm not about to lose sight of him now , not after all of this .
tr	0	Her back was straight , her waist narrow , and she was no taller than the general 's shoulder .
tr	1	A thousand thoughts swirled through her mind , a thousand things to say , all dismissed .
tr	4	she drove a finger into his chest , " I 'm not the one who left !
tr	1	" In the garden I was in chains , trying to save your life with an outrageous lie . "
tr	1	He said it simply , as if he were saying that the sun rises in the morning .
tr	4	Cast the web , the one from the ship , the one you cast again seven days ago . "
tr	1	" I 'm telling you to , it 's not invading if you 're invited . "
tr	2	Finally , Cade loosened his hold enough to look down at her and shook his head .
tr	2	I leave you alone for a fortnight or two and you almost get yourself killed . "
tr	3	The water was long since frozen solid , but he didn 't want to walk on it tonight .
tr	4	He wondered if Freya and Kell would hear him scream , but there wasn 't time .
tr	3	he straightened at the door of the tent , the warmth of the summer morning sneaking past him .
tr	3	It was hard to move around without tipping her bed over or making it snap shut .
tr	4	She offered again , realizing that the words could mean a lot more than she was offering .
tr	0	He sounded strained , like a man trying to have a conversation while standing balanced on a taut rope .
tr	4	Not because he said he 'd kill her -- that she didn 't believe and never would .
tr	1	All he had to do was smile that slow , crooked smile and she was finished .
tr	4	For his part , Cade kept his gaze fixed on the far wall of the tent .
tr	1	It was something they tried not to discuss , since all of the discussions were arguments .
tr	1	He said , drawing out her left hand , fingertips trailing across her forearm around the bracelet .
tr	4	The man blanched when he saw it , and jerked wide eyes back to Elaina 's glowing face .
tr	1	Then it occurred to him what her answer meant : packing up , and no privacy until nightfall .
tr	4	It was part of his comfortable weekly ritual -- drinking stale crystal coffee and recording images from other planets .
tr	4	It wouldn 't be long before a local source of minerals would be needed to support the next steps .
tr	2	" This wouldn 't be such a dog 's breakfast if you 'd done a dry run yesterday . "
tr	0	The Oval Office Washington , D.C. January 4th , 2026 " Okay Sam , are we done ? "
tr	2	" So what do you suggest , we let him bomb an American village of his choosing ? "
tr	3	" We tell him the same old thing , There just wasn 't time to confer with them .
tr	1	I don 't want the ambassador running into him in the outer office ; angry words might ensue . "
tr	1	My problem is I can 't tell if were conducting a war or a criminal investigation .
tr	2	" We had no way of knowing the whole parking lot would go up like that . "
tr	0	" Mr. McAdam , it 's a little late to ask for that kind of payload increase . "
tr	0	He launched into an explanation of the structure of the massive adaptive buoyancy aircraft as an assistant approached Charles .
tr	2	" Will you still remember all of us little people when you 're rich and famous ? "
tr	3	I caught the Staff Captain telling our systems integrator to move half of the bridge equipment .
tr	2	" How exactly would a crew make money for us if we weren 't doing our own jobs ? "
tr	3	They need to start taking their responsibilities to the project more seriously and quit playing politics . "
tr	3	" Mark my words , that staff captain is pushing a whiny complaint straight to the top . "
tr	1	" Oh , I 'm counting on that , " Frank answered in a dark tone .
tr	4	They 're supposed to be the ones that know where the terminals go in the first place .
tr	3	I 'll hammer them about the conduit changes so they remember to sort it all out in time . "
tr	4	" I suppose there 's no chance of someone flinging the doors open and yelling Surprise ! " .
tr	3	I was on the phone with Chuck at the time talking about assistance to JAXA . "
tr	2	" So , if it 's not a hoax , what do we do about it ? "
tr	0	Sixty Meter Observatory Mauna Kea , Hawaii January 4th , 2026 " Evening , Mike . "
tr	3	" No human activity since we started seeing them , and then , they did this last night . "
tr	3	Isn 't it possible that they might be just a bit more enlightened than us ? "
tr	4	Admiral Kelly touched the remote pad , bringing a series of schematics up on the screen .
tr	4	Kelly leaned on his right elbow , enjoying the look of anger on Gray 's face .
tr	3	We load them onto heavy lift airships that would then transit to a way station at forty thousand meters .
tr	0	" Admiral , are you saying that this can 't be done with current launch capabilities ? "
tr	2	" If we go down that road , we may not be able to come back .
tr	4	" They 've been working on designs for a space-based combat fleet for several years now .
tr	4	Paying for such a fleet might be possible but it would destroy them in the end .
tr	2	" Even if that nation only pays a few million dollars , every bit will help .
tr	4	She saw the unmistakable tells of a man who believes he has won and she finished her proposal .
tr	3	Parnell was scraping the bottom of the barrel with that excuse and had to know it .
tr	1	" I suppose that 's why you 're in your fifties and still live with your dad ? "
tr	2	He looked over at Kim who was rooting through his cooler , sacred ground at the Davidoff household .
tr	1	Jan was no stranger to scrutiny : she made a living in front of hundreds of twenty-something graduate students .
tr	3	" Dr. Colbert , thank you for taking the time to join us , " he began .
tr	3	Jan wasn 't bothered by the company but the question did manage to catch her off guard .
tr	4	" From the way they moved , it looked like they were balanced by tails . "
tr	1	" I am certain you will have no difficulties in proving your value to the team . "
tr	2	" I 'll go out for food and I 'll bring you back some decent coffee . "
tr	2	" This is one guy who won 't fall for the oldest marketing scam in the books . "
tr	3	I tried to tell them they had the wrong guy ; now what the hell do I say ?
tr	0	Howard was playing the peacemaker , as usual ; suggesting that apologies be offered all around .
tr	1	An airman pulled the door open and beckoned Frank out , handing him a flight suit .
tr	2	" So many missions had been poorly thought out and the support was almost non existent . "
tr	3	" That mission was properly thought out by the officers who were assigned to lead it . "
tr	4	The hair on the back of Frank 's neck suddenly stood on end as he stared back at her .
tr	1	I used to cut a dashing figure in my little uniform , I 'll have you know . "
tr	1	He was still working his fingers , restoring circulation after standing outside on a brisk January morning .
tr	1	" Spending this much cash on a fleet that ends up belonging to the UN ? "
tr	2	" Thank you , Thomas , " Parnell nodded to Sam , who left by the side door .
tr	4	We have an enemy at the gates and we need to meet them as a united species . "
tr	3	" Mr. President , you 're the one part of this whole equation that doesn 't fit . "
tr	0	He was leaning forward facing to the right towards Parnell , his arms balancing his bulk .
tr	4	" You plan to commit us to war with an alien species and you have zero military experience . "
tr	2	" Perhaps the Illinois school system should do a better job teaching about local heroes . "
tr	3	" Well , that was the day that I finally started to learn what my Dad went through . "
tr	4	Parnell wanted to drive his point home while the majority leader was in the right frame of mind .
tr	2	" For the love of God , Bob , it 's not all doom and gloom .
tr	2	It 'll look good on you : the congressman who put his fellow man ahead of politics . "
tr	3	The fact that they didn 't hide their agency past did little to help them ... in the beginning .
tr	3	Now , sitting at his usual table , he was watching the television above the bar .
tr	3	Kevin might not be particularly astute , but he was loyal and that wasn 't something you took lightly .
tr	0	" Bastards , " Kevin said softly as the final tally came up on the screen .
tr	1	" The UN can drop a platoon of tanks anywhere they want , with supporting infantry and artillery .
tr	0	The same Air Force captain was waiting for them on the tarmac as Frank climbed out of the vehicle .
tr	3	" Actually , they didn 't just send a jet , this one is at my permanent disposal .
tr	2	You 're used to working for shareholders and they 're a hell of a lot tougher than politicians . "
tr	0	" You 're free to come along if you want , Sarah already has plans to visit Helsinki . "
tr	2	Never one to miss an opportunity , she liked to turn her triumphs into video tutorials on her blog .
tr	3	" I think the first thing you better show me is the ventilation controls for this room . "
tr	3	" They told us in the brief that hostile behavior was evident , but what did they miss ? "
tr	2	Three weeks of sitting around , looking at the same videos and trying to look busy .
tr	3	She got up and walked out of the bullpen , noting that the other two scientists were absent .
tr	4	" We figured we 'd come down and back you up since we had nothing else going on . "
tr	1	" It 's late afternoon in British Columbia so it 's probably around five or six degrees .
tr	4	Jan decided she had nothing to lose by telling the truth , so she jumped in with both feet .
tr	4	We have a team at the Mauna Kea observatory and their reports hit my desk before yours do . "
tr	0	He had a Glock on a hip holster and wore a load-bearing vest that carried a series of canisters .
tr	3	" I might be tempted to say three but four is a safer target for the first escort . "
tr	2	Frank stood and walked over to the window , Herman showing obvious disapproval of his exposure .
tr	2	Kim tapped the control pad a few times and a warbling tone followed from Tony 's phone .
tr	2	The contractor grinned as Chuck looked down at the projection on his abdomen and scuttled out of the way .
tr	2	" Tim , you could incorporate heavy duty rollers into the deck of each class of airship ?
tr	0	" There 's a reason I brought this lazy bastard along today , " he said with a grin .
tr	4	" I checked it out with legal , " Parnell breezed , glad of some light conversation .
tr	3	" Only one set of tire tracks and a scattering of footprints just outside the cave entrance .
tr	1	We need landing craft as well as air cover , not to mention troops for a planetary insertion . "
tr	4	If nothing else , his technical knowledge of how the massive telescope array worked made him indispensable .
tr	4	As soon as it became clear that the aliens were not friendly , the language had shifted immediately .
tr	4	When you spend a lot of time in the field , you start obsessing about the opposite sex .
tr	0	Captain Gao was something of a hero in China , quietly celebrated in naval and civilian circles .
tr	0	Jess and Ambassador Zhu welcomed the man and he sat , taking a sip of the proffered tea .
tr	4	" By forcing myself to learn a new language I found that I became more creative . "
tr	1	It 's not as if he was the sole cause of the conflict , Jess mused .
tr	1	She looked over to Ambassador Zhu and saw a slight smile in the corners of his eyes .
tr	2	" I have been authorized to promote you to the rank of Hai Jun Da Xiao . "
tr	0	She and the ambassador continued down the hall , leaving Gao in a state of euphoric shock .
tr	1	" Getting shot in the face has a way of knocking sense into a man . "
tr	4	He looked at the two men sitting across from him , seeing that they weren 't quite convinced .
tr	1	A surprised murmur ran through the small group of officers as they absorbed the generational connection .
tr	3	Just to remind us that we have better things to do than kill each other . "
tr	4	He indicated the small group of senior officers who sat at the table with their respective ambassadors .
tr	1	" Driving the aliens away from Mars , I should think , " replied the British ambassador .
tr	1	Leaning back , he gave a curt nod to Gao who inclined his head slightly in return .
tr	0	" You really think a civilization that can cross the stars would send an inadequate force ? "
tr	3	" So what 's the big news that you had to tell me in person ? "
tr	1	A young man bounded off a sofa , bringing his body to rigid attention in his surprise .
tr	4	He noticed the questioning looks from the others and , slightly embarrassed , hastened to explain .
tr	4	" Sure they tended to get exploited but look at them now , " he said .
tr	4	" When the Portuguese refused to go , they were driven out by the Indian military . "
tr	3	When that didn 't pan out , they almost bought their enemies in the eighties . "
tr	3	It wasn 't much of a stretch to see what that combination could mean when it came to women .
tr	3	Callum was just turning his thoughts back to the columns when his phone started to ring .
tr	1	" If there 's any problems with docking , it 'll be because of our friends in California . "
tr	4	He gave a sigh of relief as the clamps engaged along the length of the vessel .
tr	3	In the last six weeks , the mountaintop site had transformed into a small , green town .
tr	2	She was almost to the main door when it opened and a small group of officers walked in .
tr	3	I knew that , but somehow it got pushed to the back of my mind lately . "
tr	3	He nodded assent to the other officers who were indicating that they would catch up with him later .
tr	0	" I was captured in Afghanistan when a local warlord shot down our Chinook , " he said dryly .
tr	0	" I can 't imagine what that must have been like , " she finally said .
tr	0	" Liam , " she began , reaching out to place a hand on his forearm .
tr	4	The Frey House Antioch , California June 7th , 2026 " Is it all here ? "
tr	4	Cal reached over to Kevin 's shirt pocket and pushed the button on the remote through the fabric .
tr	3	" What is that volcano , the one with the buildings and parking lots in it ? "
tr	0	He paused to strap black swim fins and a mask onto a large waterproof bag before he stood .
tr	4	The man sitting with her pretended a sudden intense interest in the surfers , his ears a dark red .
tr	4	He placed the inner half of the mold and tacked on the closers at the bottom and sides .
tr	3	That was what made them so easy to recruit , but it also made them potential liabilities .
tr	4	He laughed suddenly as the answer came to him , waving off Kevin 's inquiring look .
tr	0	He felt the hairs on his arms standing on end as he worked through the implications .
tr	0	With a surplus of food , they might have had a Renaissance era of their own .
tr	3	I don 't think there 's another person on this planet that could get away with calling him that .
tr	3	He 'd tried to convince them to stay and tough it out but they were doggedly insisting on leaving .
tr	1	They had finished a full day 's work by noon and left the hangar extension with working lights .
tr	4	" Before you two end up heading for Tia Juana , maybe we should go through the deficiencies ? "
tr	1	" Anyway , I asked if we could come in tonight and pick them up . "
tr	4	He noticed the screen above the bar and leaned in to read the caption beneath the video .
tr	1	" It won 't work , of course , and that means a run on the French banks . "
tr	3	" Just what the UN wants , an excuse to occupy Europe and lock it down . "
tr	3	If we get through the next twenty-four hours without getting pinched , we can look at expanding .
tr	0	he had said in a North Florida drawl that he only seemed to have after a few drinks .
tr	4	Yesterday , the walls and structure were entirely white but now there are gray lumps on the columns .
tr	3	" Frank , get to the other side and start pulling the wires out of these damned things . "
tr	1	His eyes opened and he found himself looking at the standard institutional ceiling of acoustical tiles .
tr	4	He pulled the covers over his arms so it wouldn 't be obvious he was now free .
tr	0	Sam reached out and took back his cigarette , taking a drag while he thought through the briefing package .
tr	3	" Let 's get Tom Kelly to put a heavy guard on the Moffett site . "
tr	1	His persistence , and his complete inability to hide his attraction to her , had finally won her over .
tr	4	" Let 's get dressed and see if Christina and John are up for getting some lunch . "
tr	0	Frank ran a hand over his head , pulling it away to check for blood as he drifted .
tr	1	" Those guys are quick ; I almost made an ass of myself for nothing . "
tr	4	He looked out the window and saw that the module had already cleared the cargo hold .
tr	0	That way you avoid destroying a ship or having to crap in bags for the next five days . "
tr	2	" Golf Charlie ; roger that , two meters , confirm rotational correction on visual , over . "
tr	3	" That 's what I 'm thinking , " Jan was still looking up at the two images .
tr	3	" Well it 's obvious that they did just that , " Dr. Tudor pointed out .
tr	4	She pulled out the filter unit -- almost the size of a spare tire -- and dumped it .
tr	2	Take a foothold on Mars , set up a logistics base and clone the invasion force onsite . "
tr	2	" Colonel , if I miss something I could get a lot of good people killed . "
tr	3	She crossed the atrium , sitting down at one of the dedicated application terminals and began to type .
tr	4	Only by pulling strings did he manage to get approval for his mother 's eye surgery .
tr	3	He had put it on mute during the briefing and hadn 't bothered to reset it .
tr	4	There was a slight pause as always , giving time for orders to be written down .
tr	4	" Fired on the crowd , " Cal said , holding up the newspaper that he had been reading .
tr	0	Cal had contacted Kevin through a rented mailbox after reaching New York to ask for Mark 's information .
tr	3	" I pay for the bag plus markup and that covers my tab until it runs out .
tr	3	The pace of the bombardment began to wane as the protestors started to run low on ammunition .
tr	1	He used French , despite the earlier decision to use Swiss Italian for all radio communication while in Paris .
tr	2	A rage against the fools who had decided that combat troops should be used as crowd control .
tr	0	Two days later , he found himself leaning against a pillar inside of the great cathedral .
tr	3	This priest knows what happened but can 't talk with me about it unless I tell him myself .
tr	2	" If you could go back two days , what would you have done differently ? "
tr	3	If the priest noticed that the soldier hadn 't said them , he gave no sign of it .
tr	0	" I wanted to study canon law but I found myself placed in charge of an orphanage . "
tr	2	" Major , it is my well-founded opinion that you could have done nothing to prevent this tragedy .
tr	3	If that meant shooting the student , then that NCO would have a very difficult memory to live with .
tr	3	" I can try to get him talking on the way to Kennedy this Friday . "
tr	1	The emphasis of this vessel was obviously on attack , though she could still sting in withdrawal .
tr	0	In the days of sail , a ship 's main armament was mounted on the port and starboard sides .
tr	0	A captain who crossed the T was one who had his broadside facing the bow of an enemy .
tr	4	He carefully pulled his helmet from the Velcro tab at his waist and slid it over his head .
tr	2	Now , with ten seconds to go , his mind ran through the worst case scenario .
tr	0	Frank raised his hands involuntarily as a brilliant fireball blossomed from the end of the huge gun .
tr	2	Frank looked to the damage control option on the central monitor and breathed a sigh of relief .
tr	1	It showed each of the ship 's six main surfaces with color-coded zones indicating individual batteries .
tr	0	Frank wasn 't sure of the man 's rank as he was unfamiliar with German insignia .
tr	3	The new target now sat apart from the flat plane that the ship was spinning on .
tr	4	While engaging two targets , the ship herself made the third point that changed a line to a plane .
tr	2	The boy forced himself to stand up , tears dripping off his chin and onto the embroidered gold cross of his white school uniform .
tr	1	In addition to being tall and blond with skin that crisped red in the strong Cochabamba sun , Noah had studied Spanish in Spain .
tr	1	And her brown hair , now sporting an uneven cut with burgundy highlights , let her fit right in with her Bolivian friends .
tr	0	She was sheathed in a puffy pink coat , mounds of pink scarves , and a snow white knit hat with pale pink sparkles .
tr	0	Maybe that was why now , with daylight streaming through the holes in the schoolhouse wall , it was so darn hard to move .
tr	4	When she moved to stand up , the powdery remains of dried up fleas shifted on the navy fleece of the sleeping bag .
tr	1	Within minutes , Noah had the group of kids sitting on a grassy knoll and captivated by Bible songs with actions .
tr	0	She grew up in church and could rattle off this story by heart , in English , Spanish , or Quechua .
tr	0	She was going to have to ask around later to figure out if that was really how that phrase should be used .
tr	2	" I want you to know kids , if Jesus is with you , you don 't have to be scared of anything .
tr	2	It would only make her think of her brother , the missing boy who was probably never going to come home .
tr	4	They were alone on the cement rooftop high over Peshawar , and abandoned the Pashto language for their native Spanish .
tr	3	The other two collapsed on top of him , the part of their brains that controls involuntary movements effectively destroyed .
tr	3	The throbbing wail of a siren cut through the heat outside the apartment building , racing towards the murdered Americans .
tr	0	Alejo and his team sat on burgundy and ivory carpets , faced with silver platters of seared roti bread and lamb curry .
tr	4	They were all Muslims , having converted at different times in their lives : high school , university , graduate school .
tr	1	The guy was a PhD in philosophy and comparative religions , so he came in handy , instructing new recruits in religion .
tr	4	Like a prism scattered light into different colors , everyone in the organization had different talents , brought the light in different ways .
tr	4	Benjamin produced fresh roti bread and goat cheese from a paper sack , and Stalin was already stretching his legs out on the bed .
tr	4	Benjamin was quietly spreading goat cheese on a piece of bread , leaning his chair up against the wall next to Alejo .
tr	2	Stalin frowned and stopped stuffing grapes into his mouth from yet another sack of food the guys had carried in .
tr	3	He tried to sit up straight but felt the three cups of coffee he 'd just downed settling in his gut like cool acid .
tr	4	His team leaned forward and , stuffing the nausea that came whenever he thought about Ruben , Alejo told them .
tr	0	A swish of fabric drew her attention to the tiny Quechua lady at her side , holding a tray of empanadas .
tr	0	" Do a Filomena , you know I can 't resist empanadas , " she told the older lady in Quechua .
tr	4	Noah remembered to hold the door open for her , and then they began a brisk walk towards the closest major street .
tr	4	" This time , I 'm not sure if I should have allowed my extreme intellect to be so convincing . "
tr	0	Stalin had also gotten a really weird picture of his parents wearing matching lime green t-shirts at a rally for world peace .
tr	4	A sleek black Hummer glided to a stop in front of the apartment , purring in the early morning chill .
tr	1	Now Ishmael Khan was Alejo 's handler in the Prism , this Muslim organization dedicated to fighting against injustice for Allah .
tr	0	The Khan was a strict Muslim , but would he really react so strongly to Alejo 's moving on as Stalin had implied ?
tr	4	Or maybe Stalin and Alejo were just painting themselves scary pictures from nothing , like campfire ghost stories under the moon .
tr	3	And , except for Stalin , they absolutely didn 't know a thing about the decision Alejo was trying to make .
tr	2	Sometime around noon , the armored Hummer arrived at a run-down village , consisting of a cluster of houses around a stone well .
tr	0	The Khan cleared his throat , spit a wad of hashish on the ground and turned towards Alejo , all smiles .
tr	1	Well , I have a little something I want to show you , and I think you will be very surprised .
tr	2	" This is the man I told you about , the man I told your commander I would bring to you . "
tr	1	Frigid rivulets of water formed crystal drops like sweat down Gabriel 's face , from his wet , spiky hair to his chin .
tr	2	He knew how to make stuff : Molotov cocktails , pretty good bombs , electronic bugs for picking up conversations .
tr	1	He 'd gotten a scholarship in Bolivia to go to university in Iran , and been recruited into the Prism there .
tr	4	" Mr. Khan sent me to tell you I will pick you up at eight for a little good-bye dinner , " Mateen announced .
tr	1	The knife slashed his throat like the sting of a thousand wasps and his eyes rolled back into his head .
tr	3	That night she had seen how Noah still looked at her with kindness after that stupid moment in the bar .
tr	2	The door of the minivan slid open with a hollow whine and everyone spilled out , cautiously tiptoeing over to the cliff .
tr	0	A young Bolivian couple strolled by with their son and a pair of Mickey Mouse balloons , munching hamburgers wrapped in plastic sacks .
tr	4	His pale green eyes reflected the weak rays of the early morning sun , glazed , vacant , and bleak .
tr	4	That 's where Gabriel 's family thought he went when he disappeared with his friends for weeks at time : skiing in France .
tr	2	" God gave me back my life , but now I feel that my life has to totally belong to him , you know ?
tr	2	" God wouldn 't save your life just so you can feel all tortured about it , " Alejo frowned .
tr	4	Alejo had to laugh at the image of Gabriel wielding an AK-47 and smoking opium in the middle of the desert .
tr	2	He 's got himself sitting on a chair , and then around him are four little boys on the ground , looking at him .
tr	4	Rage filled him , and he let it , anything to keep away the tears he really didn 't want Gabriel seeing .
tr	0	He and Gabriel stared at each other for a moment , and then Alejo whirled around and began to pace .
tr	3	Let the national authorities punish him according to the law ... That really hadn 't gone so well in the past .
tr	0	A total indifference to his activities had only made Salazar more bold in breaking the law , knowing no one would care .
tr	4	A dozen more butterflies soared through the spray near him , dodging clouds of crystalline mist tossed off the roaring waterfall .
tr	4	It was May , nearly winter in Bolivia , but here the earth was still full of butterflies and tangled flowers .
tr	0	I was taking a walk , but I 've been gone for a long time now and it 's staring to get dark . "
tr	0	" I had pineapple ice cream , and then , " a dramatic pause , " I got some henna tattoos .
tr	3	Breaking into a run , Noah bounded down the hotel 's steps three at a time and spun out onto the street .
tr	4	Noah shook the man 's leathery hand , and backed out of the pharmacy , destination medium-sized bus near the store .
tr	0	She was wearing jeans instead of that beautiful skirt and Noah would have recognized that light blue alpaca sweater anywhere .
tr	3	Noah squinted at their tickets , and then found the seat numbers on the right side , pretty near the front .
tr	3	But later , I felt so horrible about everything that I never showed up to go to Puerto Rico in the morning .
tr	0	" But when the son came back , the Father didn 't just let him slave away as a servant .
tr	1	" I have something to give you , " he finally said , releasing her hands hastily and digging around in his pocket .
tr	1	He sat like that in silence for a full minute , eyes flickering , obviously running through something in his head .
tr	0	" Ok , now I 'm sweating , " Noah said , rubbing a hand across his face and sucking in a deep breath .
tr	4	He unlatched the opening to the tent and jogged across the darkened clearing towards the group who was just exiting the forest .
tr	1	Still keeping her tightly in his grip , he cautiously slid his hand off her mouth , waiting for Stalin to leave .
tr	1	He managed to free one hand from his mass of possessions and held it out to the surviving girl , rather sadly .
tr	4	She forced herself to erase that thought , scrub the eraser madly across the pencil lines on the page until it was gone altogether .
tr	4	She closed her eyes against the cool material of the sleeping bag , feeling sick and dizzy , but surprisingly , not in pain .
tr	2	" I would have had the guys just leave you on the road , for someone to find and take to the hospital .
tr	0	The question made her furious as she thought about Noah : where he was , if he was hurt right now .
tr	0	The two girls were teaching a group of ladies to read in Quechua at a church downtown , close to Caf Amara .
tr	0	Noah ran a hand through his straggly sandy blond hair , pushing it aside to reveal a little silver hoop in his right ear .
tr	4	The following screens explained how Islam really is the heritage of Spanish-speaking peoples and they should return to it with all their hearts .
tr	4	They should be dysfunctional to the core , lounging together at a seedy bar while the kids ran wild in the streets .
tr	3	The good thing is , though , that it looks like she 'll never find out that her brother killed them .
tr	0	Alejandro actually had the gall to draw back in surprise , screwing up his face as if offended by her insinuation .
tr	2	Alejo shrugged , one foot tapping on the floor , probably anxious to get back to whatever he was doing outside .
tr	4	" Six years , " Stalin remarked , stepping carefully over a very tall rock , slippery with the morning dew .
tr	0	" Well apparently I might die today anyway , so I might as well enjoy my last day , right ?
tr	1	She wadded the damp socks up into her shoes and began walking again , picking her way over broken sticks and squishy moss .
tr	4	She barely had time to register this fact before Alejo threw an arm around her and dragged her tighter against his chest .
tr	0	And then , from the side , Alejo was moving forward , marching towards her with a face full of calm fury .
tr	1	She slumped against his shoulder , and the sounds of crickets singing among the banana trees and grass crunching underfoot slowly faded away .
tr	4	She remembered passing out , and that Alejo had hit her , and yeah , the pain was definitely still there .
tr	1	I had to stop him cold in his tracks , and hitting you was the only way I could think of .
tr	3	She supposed it was part of his lovely escape plan , but she still didn 't like thinking about it at all .
tr	0	Alejo played absently with the fringe on a canvas bag of oranges that was part of the truck 's cargo .
tr	3	As horrible as it is , sometimes those two commands just can 't both happen at the same time . "
tr	3	She just lay there , squinting against the bright sky , trying not to think about how much everything hurt .
tr	0	A battered blue motorcycle leaned against a sleek banana plant , and a gaggle of scraggly chickens pecked lazily in the powdery dirt .
tr	1	The room just inside the door was cramped , graced with a burnt orange couch with torn upholstery and a few armchairs .
tr	2	The shirt was orange with a koala , or wombat , or some such thing cheerily stuffing a stalk of bamboo into its mouth .
tr	4	He had a couple of implanted tracking devices , in case anyone needed to track him when he was on assignment .
tr	0	A squeaking of metal told him that his family had taken seats in the awkward silence , unsure of what to do .
tr	1	He couldn 't even bring himself to mention the name of Jesus in this discussion as his reason for leaving Islam .
tr	4	Then Alejo 's mother stood up unevenly from the iron chair , a look of intense sadness quivering on her face .
tr	4	I knew I needed to leave for a while , when I realized that I believe what Jesus taught , not Islam .
tr	2	Alejo loosed a heavy sigh and waited outside the hostel room door , fighting the urge to find cigarettes and do some serious smoking .
tr	1	No matter how highly he thought of himself and his problem-solving abilities , there really was no fixing this situation , was there ?
tr	0	No matter what happens , God is always with us , and he keeps us all in the palm of his hand . "
tr	3	Equally as worrying was the fact that no one in his family protested his orders , at least not with words .
tr	3	" Ishmael and other powerful men don 't want the word to get out about what I saw in Pakistan , " he said .
tr	1	How many more children would have their lives ruined , while I sat , a ' good ' man , doing nothing ? "
tr	0	Alejo raised his hands to make sarcastic quotation marks in the air around the word " good " , lips twisting cynically .
tr	3	I told them , thinking they would tell the police , that they would help my friend and put Salazar in jail .
tr	1	They said , if they got involved in this situation , they would lose all their influence for Christ . "
tr	1	" I went to live with my uncle , in Santa Cruz and went to a high school built by the Iranian government .
tr	4	Who built a beautiful community center for desperately poor children to come play basketball , only to lure them into his clutches .
tr	0	So far , the confirmed dead are a government guy from Cochabamba and three of his staff : two women and one man . "
tr	2	Thirty seconds of silence filled the room , as both of them sunk down onto one of the beds , listless .
tr	2	" Probably just some kid will come out to take our money , and then we 've got a room .
tr	4	" See , that wasn 't too bad , " Alejo said under his breath as he jammed the silver key into the lock .
tr	4	But he 'd never really thought about other people who could be hurt in the middle of delivering justice to the bad guys .
tr	0	Her hands were shaking so hard she could hardly flip the thing open to gasp a breathless , " Hello ? "
tr	3	What kind of man just sat there without saying anything when a woman finds out the guy she loved has died ?
tr	2	As she did , Eduardo 's gaze followed her hand , and his mouth opened into a round " O " .
tr	2	Well , a lot of the guys , we used to always tell him , ' Well , start a relationship then !
tr	2	He was just going to ceremoniously throw it out the side of the bus , over the road of death .
tr	2	" Thank you , " she finally whispered , wanting to ask more before she had to go into the living room .
tr	1	A crisp white dress shirt was tucked into worn jeans , and his hair was slicked back with way too much gel .
tr	4	" I was part of the team that went down to the bus accident , " he clarified , expression grave and serious .
tr	0	Hector Villanueva had already launched back into the conversation , seriously stating the facts to answer Noah 's father 's questions .
tr	3	Obviously they had been thrown from the bus while it was still pretty high up the mountain , to have landed so far away .
tr	0	What she really wanted to do was sling the black guitar strap over her shoulder and walk away , never looking back .
tr	0	The chorus she had just sung rang in her head , even as Eduardo and Tobias began to sing Amazing Grace .
tr	4	24 sea green EVERYONE ELSE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE , and Alejo was left in the echoing entryway of some missionaries ' house .
tr	3	Pretty soon , Alejo would call a radio taxi with dark windows to take them back to their hideous quarters .
tr	0	A small dog , white curls graying where its belly scraped the grass , was trotting calmly around the spacious front yard .
tr	4	Alejo saw Gabriel , down below , pointing off to the park across the street , darkened with shady trees and deep green vegetation .
tr	1	" So , " Gabriel continued , blithely , " this is the way this is going to go down .
tr	0	" I have to take you back now , che , " Gabriel told Alejo , and his voice was really pained .
tr	1	He slid inside and closed it , waiting for Gabriel to come around and stick the key in the ignition .
tr	1	The Khan is offering these poor guys scholarships to study , and then they 're just being used as fodder for religious wars .
tr	2	Besides , what could be more pleasing to God then doing what those poor guys from the countryside are doing ?
tr	4	I don 't need some man who made the insane claim that he was God to bring me close to God .
tr	4	" If the Khan wanted her here you should have told me beforehand , because it 's a little late now .
tr	0	" I told you it wasn 't about her , " Benjamin said to Stalin , shooting an amused glance at Alejo .
tr	3	She cringed , but Gabriel just squatted on the truck bed next to her and put a finger to his lips .
tr	1	Hands steady , he lifted a handful of oblong bullets from one pant pocket and began stuffing them into the gun .
tr	4	How can I stand this , that I can 't even trust you , who have been like my own nephew ?
tr	2	I don 't know why I should believe you , but I have known you since you were almost a child , Alejo .
tr	4	Ishmael Khan took three clipped steps forward and rammed the gun he held against Alejo 's forehead with an echoing click .
tr	2	His curly hair was wet and sticky and blood splattered over one ear and ran down his chin to pool on the wool blanket .
tr	2	The sound of her gasping breaths echoed in slow motion around the interior of the truck , slow and rasping .
tr	4	The truth came to her all of a sudden and she crashed forward onto her knees , palms spread out on Alejo 's back .
tr	4	She nodded and scrambled up after them , leaping out onto what she saw was the sidewalk of the hospital .
tr	4	Clean white tiles spread before her , and the air was ripe with the scent of Clorox and chamomile tea cooling on breakfast trays .
tr	3	I 'd say we 're not out of the woods yet , after that little speech our patient just made .
tr	0	The Shara family had maids and servants to do every kind of manual labor , but baking bread had been his mother 's hobby .
tr	3	It stunk that she couldn 't know about his work , and especially about the assignment Gabriel was on today .
tr	4	Conditions there were abject poverty , as the Palestinians had been forced off their land by the Israelis and left with nowhere to go .
tr	2	They belonged to no country , thus had no passport and could never leave that place to study overseas or work .
tr	0	As the ringing began again , he padded across the wide entryway into a room that lay behind a heavy wooden door .
tr	2	But the most important item for today 's mission was laid out on a crude wooden workbench , awaiting the arrival of Manuel .
tr	3	Last night the doctor had ordered a lot of tests , but of course it was because of the gun shot to the head .
tr	0	The female announcer was back again , in a low-cut mauve suit coat and braided gold earrings that hung to her shoulders .
tr	0	Startled , she dug around and managed to pull out the small , cheap phone Alejo had bought her at the Hostal Salta .
tr	1	The nurses ' station was silent and empty ; a phone rang insistently on the desk , but no one ran to answer it .
tr	0	One was a tall , lanky guy with broad shoulders and a narrow waist , buzzed sandy brown hair , and a hooked nose .
tr	4	The two people who were making themselves at home in the room seemed as happy about Alejo getting his sight back as he was .
tr	4	" We 're just people who came here to visit sick Uncle Marco after a long day of work in the market .
tr	4	They rounded to the front of the hospital and past two olive green police vehicles , red lights periodically flashing in the night .
tr	0	Sometime along the way , the tall man with the hooked nose had introduced himself as Tabor , and the woman as Sandal .
tr	2	Mr. Cole looked over towards the door , but the two who had come to the hospital were already gone .
tr	2	Neither of you can just go back into your old lives , just show up in society as you were .
tr	1	His face was contorted , and he kicked at the swivel chair with one violent motion , clenching his fist .
tr	0	You know that Allah will reward me with Paradise , and I will be there , waiting for both of you .
tr	2	Gabriel looked at his violin a moment , reflectively , and then continued , " I am not a tough warrior or a soldier .
tr	0	Such is His truthful pledge in the Torah , the Gospel , and the Quran - and who fulfills His pledge better than Allah ?
tr	0	What better way to earn Allah 's favor than as a suicide bomber , making the ultimate sacrifice to do Allah 's will ?
tr	0	If he had to guess , he would say Sandal was from Iran or Iraq , and Tabor from Israel .
tr	2	" Short for Cole , Inc , the shipping company here in Morocco my grandfather owned and gave to me .
tr	4	" Ah , what are we doing here hiding out under the leaves and sitting in the muck like kindergartners ? "
tr	3	" And , sending her to live with your family isn 't what I wanted to talk to you about .
tr	2	What I wanted to talk with you about now is the issue of forgiveness from others who you have offended .
tr	0	You can help her use her talents for the kingdom , by sharing what you know so she can work with us .
tr	1	Rupert heaved himself up from the ground with a loud crack , clumps of dirt clinging to his worn jeans .
tr	3	" We should tell her tonight , at the latest , " Rupert said , walking towards the edge of the arbor .
tr	2	A door scraped across the wood of Rupert 's living room and she saw the older man and Alejo standing in the office .
tr	0	Alejo , however , had the pained grimace of a man who had just escaped the dentist after a root canal .
tr	0	After pancakes , she had taken a walk and thought : If Alejo is Paul , then I am Peter .
tr	2	" Alejo , it 's ok , " she said , then slid down to the warm wood floor in front of him .
tr	4	He lowered himself down to sit cross-legged as she was , not even bothering to swipe away the raw tears matting his eyelashes .
tr	1	Alejo was debating between " Las Vegas " and " Disneyland " when a second wave of sound announced Stalin 's answer .
tr	1	Then he had gotten back on the plane to a more pleasant destination , planning on sending his parents tickets to come visit .
tr	1	He had studied Christianity in depth during his masters and PhD , of course , along with all the other religions .
tr	4	" He 's the pastor of an evangelical church here , " she explained , " but he 's also quite a scholar .
tr	1	Heart sinking , Stalin pressed his lips together so his jaw wouldn 't hang open again , gawking at Shannon .
tr	4	A rubber boot connected with his back as the rush of light hit his wide-open eyes , slamming him to the pavement .
tr	4	A dozen feet away , circled by a dreary ring of hoary stones , a cement block protruded from the park square .
tr	1	A ream of black cloth descended in front of Sami 's vision and cinched in a hard knot behind his skull .
tr	0	Worship of Satan A mullah began to pray loudly in Arabic , and Sami waited with his temple to the icy block .
tr	0	Since then she had been here in Montana , living with her parents on the ranch that was her childhood home .
tr	3	The intruder was now out of the shadows , holding up two tan hands in a gesture meant to calm her down .
tr	4	He looked younger with his hair shaved , face smoothed of many of the tortured lines that had marked it three months earlier .
tr	4	Fortunately , due to my superior intellect , I was able to recognize the repetitive event after only being caught in them five times .
tr	4	To make matters worse , I didn 't bring enough food or water , so my energy reserves were pretty low .
tr	2	No sir , that was a lot of snow , enough to fill up a couple of very large houses .
tr	3	Facing the mountain , he moved his right foot to his right , then moved his left foot over to match it .
tr	1	I was his lifeline , but I had no idea if I could hold his weight in the event of a fall .
tr	2	" Good job dude , now cross the Couloir , " I heard Isaac yell to me as I lay and rested .
tr	0	As if in a dream state , I heard him yell to me , " and you got ta time the avalanches . "
tr	3	At first , the snow flowed over me like a gentle stream of water , but that didn 't last long .
tr	4	A split second later , I felt the full force of the wall of snow that raged over the top of me .
tr	2	Isaac pulled hard on the rope , snapping me out of my foggy state and I started off across the open snow slope .
tr	0	Suddenly , I felt a hard jerk on my jacket , only it wasn 't from above ... it was sideways .
tr	3	" Ok man , we got ta climb up this rocky face , then step around the corner to the " Diamond " .
tr	2	I took out my ice axes , looped the lanyards around my wrists and approached the mess in front of me .
tr	2	If I moved the wrong way , they could easily just pop off the rock and I 'd fall -- not good .
tr	0	With half my body hanging out over 1500 feet of air , I was now straddling the hairy edge of my raging fear .
tr	2	Quickly , I found another foot hold , but then again , another gust of wind slammed into me , knocking both feet loose .
tr	0	As I flailed in the air , I made a desperate attempt to hook my axe on anything that would hold .
tr	0	As the faded Buick roared past , Trae and Lena lay motionless on the front lawn , their minds and bodies unable to react .
tr	2	Beyond the main thoroughfare , on the secondary and tertiary roads , tiny houses dotted the roads leading out of town .
tr	1	Serving in the military for most of his life , he was no stranger to the horrors that warfare could bring .
tr	4	Ordinarily , Dr. Morgan preferred the protected confines of houses and barns , commandeered from private citizens at the onset of battle .
tr	4	Like violent demons , the cannons came to life as they reported with a thunderous roar , shaking the ground under them .
tr	4	Those with their backs to the volley waited and listened as the whistle grew quickly louder , into a thunderous rush of air .
tr	1	One unlucky private watched in horror as a shell found its mark in the chest of the unlucky companion marching in front of him .
tr	4	Painful blisters formed and quickly broke , leaving fresh blood along the length of the poles as they continued to push for their lives .
tr	2	He had managed to move close enough to shore to now wade toward land with his handful of belongings safe .
tr	0	A short distance away , a private pulling a horse-drawn ambulance heard the painful shriek of Corporal Fletcher over the thunder of war .
tr	3	Returned to his pacing , he gazed through the grove of birch trees , trying to view the battle at his protected location .
tr	1	" Right , I know this is your first time , so I 'll try to explain as much as practicable .
tr	4	We could do this in one pass , but we lose the precision as we slice deep into the muscle .
tr	3	I 'll cut through the bone as close to the cloth as I can without cutting through it -- the cloth , that is .
tr	4	Those all need to be tied off or he 'll bleed to death , " the doctor said as he worked .
tr	4	With the bleeding completely stopped , he slowly released the tourniquet and watched for leakages at the end of the stump .
tr	3	Throughout the day and into the night , the two surgeons worked frantically to save the injured and the dying .
tr	4	As their exhaustion set in , and hysteria and despair overwhelmed them , they searched within themselves for the strength to continue .
tr	1	Rotating the small metallic wand at various angles , images showed on the monitor , confirming their suspicions of the hidden trauma .
tr	0	It was apparent the spleen , pancreas and colon , as well as the left kidney had some form of trauma .
tr	2	" Doesn 't look small , that 's all I know , " replied Dr. Stadler , still suctioning the colon .
tr	3	" As a bullet travels , it pushes the air out of the way , creating a field of turbulent air around the bullet .
tr	4	Inserting it directly into the incision , he turned the lever and separated the ribs enough to view the upper chest cavity .
tr	3	At first he thought it was a rib fragment , but upon closer inspection Dr. Warner realized it was the second bullet .
tr	4	Handing him the paddles , they watch as he inserted them into her chest cavity and placed them on the still heart .
tr	4	As Nurse Edwards called the time of death , he stood motionless as he watched the lifeless body of the young girl .
tr	2	He turned and walked out the OR doors , oblivious to all , in a state of shock and disbelief .
tr	2	Looking up , she watched with sadness as a droplet of blood pooled , then slide down from the elevator button .
tr	0	In a daze , Dr. David Warner stood in the middle elevator and stared through an old photo hanging on the back wall .
tr	4	As David struggled to free his mind of tragedy , his eyes began to focus on the picture in front of him .
tr	2	Suddenly , he saw his gloved hands , sticky with drying blood , holding the framed picture held out in front of him .
tr	3	David turned and looked at the old doctor , then back at the spot of grass that used to be the elevator .
tr	4	Suddenly , a loud clap of thunder sounded just beyond the birch trees , shaking the ground under his feet .
tr	4	the old doc questioned with a bit of suspicion , then added , " Don 't tell me you 're gray ? "
tr	3	David was about to speak when another shell hit a bank just beyond the birch trees , startling both he and the old doctor .
tr	1	" I have medical training and thought I could be of use , " David replied , hoping his answer would suffice .
tr	3	He hadn 't thought about it until that moment , but he was trained to operate in a highly technical environment .
tr	1	Dr. Morgan sensed David 's apprehension and said , " Son , are you sure you 're up for this ? "
tr	1	" It 's a bit more primitive than I 'm used to , but I can manage , " David replied .
tr	3	Trying not to move the traumatized leg too much , he moved it only slightly , cutting away the pant leg .
tr	2	A fire had already been smoldering from early morning usage , so Dr. Morgan tossed more wood on the coals .
tr	2	Yup , you 're right , it sounds like a sport and I can live up to my name , no problem .
tr	3	I took the first set of stairs up two flights and followed the woman as she went to the right .
tr	3	CHAPTER 3 The Cliff I was in the woods now and the lights from the building didn 't penetrate into the forest .
tr	3	It was my school picture , the retake from last spring with my hair about as short as it 's ever been .
tr	2	I could not in a million years figure out how I got here or what I was supposed to do .
tr	0	" The usual , " she said , " ipad , knives , guns and for back up : paper and pencils . "
tr	0	" Oh , and a flashlight , of course , " she added as she shined a narrow beam in my face .
tr	2	Old Miss or Mrs. Jackson was already below me , going down faster than you 'd think an old lady could go .
tr	0	When they arrived in January it had been snowing and a blizzard had closed school on the first day she was going to go .
tr	3	The majority of the trip would be mostly expressway but the last forty miles or so it was going to be tricky .
tr	2	Each one had a stone chimney but only the first two had smoke , and , she now noticed , footprints .
tr	1	" Yes , I 'm Kim , Mr. Stark , and this is my daughter , your great-granddaughter , Missy . "
tr	0	Besides the loveseat there was an old rocking chair , an easy chair , a TV , a computer desk and a hutch .
tr	3	The room was open to the kitchen , which was just a wall with a stove , refrigerator , sink and a short counter .
tr	0	The original lodge was much smaller and had burned down many years ago but they had rebuilt it and added the cabins .
tr	4	" I called her Missy , " he said with a smile , " but her real name 's a mystery . "
tr	2	Without waiting for a reply or explaining who Kevin was Mr. Stark eased out of the chair and opened the front door .
tr	3	He had rattled all that information off so fast that she had to think a minute before she could get her questions out .
tr	3	She followed him again and this time she took the stairs to the third floor two at a time , too .
tr	3	She wasn 't about to tell him that the door was still locked , it just hadn 't been closed all the way .
tr	3	They would need a pole with a hook on the end to catch the metal ring on the attic door .
tr	1	She saw a lot of big boxes , two trunks , a crib , four mattresses , and some old furniture .
tr	0	Kevin had already opened it and was taking things out ; a dress , two hats , some strange looking pants .
tr	1	I 'm always busy making something , tinkering with something , inventing something ... making more secrets and mysteries . "
tr	3	They stayed that night in the second little cabin and had a nice breakfast with Mr. Stark on Sunday morning .
tr	4	She turned the knife over and over in her hands and pulled out all the little tools one by one .
tr	3	Every day she practiced opening and closing the box until she could do it without the instructions and do it fast .
tr	4	There was a new sign at the last turn announcing Big Pine Lodge , open May to September , turn here .
tr	4	The pine trees that had been so prominent in March were less visible now that the Maple and Oak trees had completely leafed out .
tr	0	There was a distinct aroma to the woods that was very appealing and the songs of the birds were amazing .
tr	4	It didn 't look too hard and she felt good about earning her keep : free meals and room and freedom for the summer .
tr	3	" You better sit on it like a swing the first time , legs out away from the tree . "
tr	2	For Missy , working here in the summer was a way for her to kind of get to know him .
tr	3	" Let 's be sneaky about it , " Missy said , " I don 't want to get tied up and burned . "
tr	2	Dave pointed at a couple of girls on the beach and made a rude comment about one to Rob who laughed loudly .
tr	3	Kevin 's parents , the Jacksons , would have to smooth things over with the other guests when the complaints started coming in .
tr	3	" Hi , Mr. Stark , " Kevin added , then stopped to stare out at the boys in the canoes .
tr	3	They almost caught up to Lonnie and Ricky when the trail opened up to the yard around the stone cottage .
tr	2	He motioned for him to follow him and they slipped around the corner and hid in what was once a small bedroom .
tr	3	Two cute and playful cubs followed her into the water , snapping at each other and biting at the water as well .
tr	3	Though Kevin had shown Missy the secret staircase to the attic , it was Missy who had found a strange key in the attic .
tr	3	There had been a little light seeping through the slats of the trapdoor , but now it was total and complete blackness .
tr	4	Once he had been trapped down here by some awful people who were trying to keep the valuable pictograms undiscovered .
tr	3	Then he turned off the flashlight and they both strained to see any glimmer of light that there might be .
tr	0	It was tight , but Rob managed to stand on the rung below Dave and reach up with his hands and push .
tr	2	Above them the stove was slowly moving , leaving deep scratches in the old wood floor as it circled toward the front door .
tr	4	They both clamped their hands over their ears and waited for the loud bang that often came after a wild ride .
tr	0	As the trail became harder and harder to run on Dave and Rob gave up the chase and just walked .
tr	4	Missy grabbed the saddle pad and threw it on Johnny 's back then held the bridle while Kevin saddled him .
tr	2	" That horse , Misty , can be hard to handle if you don 't know what you 're doing . "
tr	1	" If you knew what you were doing , you 'd know to tighten the cinch first , " Kevin said .
tr	3	It wasn 't actually a mountain just a really big hill that happened to hide the most clever entrance to the caves .
tr	0	She was mad at herself for not thinking of that sooner and her head was racing with ideas of what to do next .
tr	2	" We can go back to the stable now or cross over onto State land and ride in there for another half hour .
tr	4	The two horses kept pace and the kids sat on their saddles as comfortably as if they were on the merry-go-round .
tr	2	Dave and Rob 's room was actually connected to 214 by two interior doors that could be locked from one side only .
tr	2	They checked out their room , nothing fancy , two twin beds and a bathroom , then looked at the other room .
tr	4	They were going to put ketchup in all of their brothers ' underwear or in the pockets of their jeans .
tr	3	He went into the bathroom and took the two plastic wrapped drinking cups that were provided and tossed one to Rob .
tr	2	He took two steps toward the window when he heard the porch door creak open and saw his brother and Rob step out .
tr	3	" I 'll be right back , " Missy said , getting off the stool and heading toward the lobby .
tr	4	There was a small office in the lobby where Kevin 's mom , Mrs. Jackson , could often be found .
tr	4	Missy looked at the list and was happy to see that the bullies ' names weren 't under Monday or Tuesday .
tr	3	Lonnie and Ricky came up behind their brothers just as the pretty girls they were talking to started to laugh .
tr	3	They saw a doe and her two spotted fawns and this prompted the couple to ask questions about the wildlife .
tr	4	She shared one of the first floor lodge rooms with Angela , a college girl who worked here summers as a maid .
tr	1	" No , " Missy answered quickly , " it 's just , well , I wish I could wear make-up like you . "
tr	4	He threw one more branch in the fire and walked into the woods as if he were gathering more wood .
tr	1	He skirted around behind Lonnie and Ricky and saw one of them pushing something under a lady 's chair with his foot .
tr	4	They hadn 't been interested in girls back then especially not skinny little giggling girls who screamed at spiders , snakes and toads .
tr	1	Missy and Kevin skirted around behind Lonnie and Ricky and stood just outside the circle of golden light thrown off by the roaring blaze .
tr	4	Parents were keeping their smaller children back and , in fact , were scooting their own chairs away from the heat .
tr	1	They sat down carefully and Kevin put his hand in front of his mouth , leaned toward Missy and whispered .
tr	4	She set one bag down next to Mr. Stark , a safe place , she assumed , and handed the papers to Kevin .
tr	2	Who would have thought such an old man would have known how to turn it on and off , " Lonnie said .
tr	4	He squinted his eyes tightly shut and was about to holler as loud as he could when another idea smacked him on the forehead .
tr	0	Grandma said a Dachshund wasn 't much trouble and that was true for Noodle who hardly ever , ever barked .
tr	2	Of course that led to trouble , which led to fights , which led to yelling and , for Billy , crying .
tr	3	His room , on the right , had another door behind a drape that let you walk right into the attic .
tr	3	He would buy candy at the drug store and get a book from the attic to read on the back porch .
tr	3	Tommy could do it so expertly that Billy had taken to calling him " waxy butt " or " ski rump " .
tr	3	This would take a bit of thought ; he might even spend ten or fifteen minutes contemplating just the right combination of flavors .
tr	2	Tommy marched purposefully up to the yard and stood on the sidewalk with his hands on his hips , candy bag dangling down .
tr	0	" Hi , Tommy , look , " Billy lifted his hands and up jumped a large black cat from the carriage .
tr	2	" He 's almost bigger than Noodle , but that probably won 't stop Noodle from chasing him , " Tommy said .
tr	3	I put him in the back porch , though , and then I helped Tracy get Boots out of the tree . "
tr	2	Tommy was going to leave his bag under the chair with the books , but Noodle would sniff it out in a microsecond .
tr	0	In his hurry he raced through the old house not bothering to slow down as he passed the large old grandfather clock .
tr	0	" Step lightly , Miss Gwinn , " said a tall red-haired man as he passed a pretty young woman .
tr	2	Tommy frowned at the greetings , wondering what had happened to the traditional " Good morning " or " Good afternoon " .
tr	4	He walked for what seemed like hours and hours , miles and miles , without seeing another human being or animal .
tr	4	The roars of the lion behind him grew fainter and Tommy dared to glance back to see that he was not being followed .
tr	0	Tommy had no idea what a pink or a blue coin was worth , but he sure was hungry and dinner sounded great .
tr	1	Tommy could see it was full of blue grass and there was half a walking stick being used as a stirring spoon .
tr	3	It was hard and scratchy , but it was odd that it would just suddenly show up blocking his path .
tr	4	He had no choice but to breathe heavily on each one watching them drop and disintegrate sadly into the ground .
tr	4	He held the flame close to the floor , the wall , the ceiling , then moved around and slowly examined his prison .
tr	3	Tommy rested his hand on the base of the eighteenth torch , but didn 't lift it up out of the holder .
tr	2	" Oh , man , " Tommy looked admiringly at the young prince , " you probably don 't have to go to school .
tr	2	" You might not be too popular after a while , " Tommy warned , " only girls like school . "
tr	1	Sydney was the first one over and she took off running like a horse and yelling , " Not it ! "
tr	4	The leaves she used just crumbled and she ended up smearing the brown stuff on her shirt and legs even more .
tr	4	Our parents had this rule that at least one of us had to have a cell on us when we weren 't home .
tr	0	So I guess it 's my fault that instead of going back and having a normal day we went deeper into the woods .
tr	2	She was a font of knowledge , a treasure trove of information , a ... oh , there I go again .
tr	2	She popped out two more wet wipes and I soaked up the blood that was running down my shin and into my shoe .
tr	0	" I don 't get why it 's so dark , " Callie said as she stumbled along , last in our miniature parade .
tr	1	She just slides in a comment that may be only a few words , but she makes us all burst out laughing .
tr	1	Austin , I just noticed , was still bobbing his head all around , checking the branches above and looking around and behind us .
tr	1	A strange thing to think , but I wonder if you can have something evil inside of you without being evil yourself .
tr	3	Gifts , my father called them , but then again , he doesn 't consider it a virus at all .
tr	2	It hums along the spongy corridors of my brain , each note jumping from one stalled synapse to the next .
tr	1	At night , when the sun cannot feed me its thin soup , the song grows loud as thunder captured in my bones .
tr	2	I know the rhythms of his energy so well , that soft aqua color like postcard oceans that is his alone .
tr	1	Ryan had a glorious smile , like the sun hitting something just right and bringing out colors you hadn 't even known were there .
tr	0	As soon as Ryan gets out of class , we 'll grab lunch before I fry my brains with intermediate Latin and Shakespeare II .
tr	4	His mouth grows tighter when our eyes meet , and he is most definitely staring at me , until he isn 't .
tr	0	When I look again he is walking away , his body moving in fluid strides as he turns down another path and disappears .
tr	1	I grab my purse and turn in time to catch the last vestige of a half smile leaving his lips .
tr	1	I sneak my hand in the back pocket of Ryan 's jeans and delight in how he turns shy at it .
tr	2	They are all over the sky , and I ponder if such glitter could really be only balls of gas .
tr	0	His mouth drops open , and what comes out is a choked , " ugh , ugh , ugh . "
tr	3	I cannot see what it is , but I can feel it , an invisible string that pulls me toward the stranger .
tr	1	I don 't understand how this has happened , but I know it is the stranger 's doing , his invisible string .
tr	4	This is when I should try an escape , when I should scream for help or otherwise try to save myself .
tr	1	Not now , curled up on the floor sobbing and retching and not caring if the stranger glows me to death with his hands .
tr	2	I am gallant enough to wipe my nose so I don 't die with snot bubbling out of my nostrils .
tr	0	A naked light bulb sways above us , and a duffle bag and folded towel sit next to the cot .
tr	0	The combination of meticulously combed hair , high forehead and expensive shirt gives him a casual air of arrogance and luxury .
tr	0	" You do not understand this now , but I am making a great sacrifice for you , " the man says .
tr	1	He closes his eyes , and I hear the air dragging sharply into his lungs as he pulls back the stopper .
tr	4	You will nourish yourself from their lives , and it shall be an appropriate start to your new existence . "
tr	0	Sweat pours out of my skin , and I am shaking so hard I can hear my own teeth clattering against each other .
tr	1	Already , the fire is growing into an inferno that snakes up the back of my neck and into my brain .
tr	1	* * * Gabe 's version of events : It was a dark and stormy night ... Yes it was ... .
tr	2	" We 've crossed a lot of lines , but I 'm not going to let you cross this one .
tr	4	I 'm not a bad guy , and I 'd rather be dead then see you turn into one . "
tr	1	I hold my hands out in front of me and stare at the new dark slits running through my palms .
tr	2	" Look Maya , I wish you could know how sorry I am , we both are , that this happened to you .
tr	2	BJ was here " Look , I 'm running out to get you something that 's going to help , " Gabe continues .
tr	3	I let out a guttural moan that is wholly inadequate to express just how obliterated the little planet of Maya is .
tr	2	" Hey , " Gabe says , " I know you 're tired , but I want to show you something . "
tr	1	I try to rub my eyes and instead send flares of pain through my wrists as I tug against the cuffs .
tr	4	I am aware of Gabe 's fingers on my bare skin ; the pulse of his energy in the space between us .
tr	0	The smile jumps right back onto Gabe 's face as if it was only taking a breather in the wings .
tr	0	And yes , I am freaking out , but I can hardly manage more than a low moan and a couple of sparse tears .
tr	4	Gabe takes in a swill of breath and lets it out long and slow like he needs some time to figure his next words .
tr	3	" Not exactly everyone sitting around a table petting fat white cats and planning dastardly deeds , but close enough .
tr	4	I am fascinated by the energy -- sky blue , almost white -- leaping off his body like flames devouring dust dry kindling .
tr	2	" You can 't let your emotions ... " " I 'm so sick of ... " Gabe bites back his next words .
tr	0	The air from the vents catches in his hair and sends the smell of his sweat and shampoo throughout the car .
tr	3	I don 't know how I can possibly keep this up , but that 's why I 've got to stay in the present .
tr	2	He 's also quite fond of hugs and romantic comedies ; you probably don 't know that about him , " Gabe says .
tr	3	The brothers pretend not to notice , but they pause each time I pull my hand out of the water .
tr	2	You don 't know how hard it is to kill an angel , especially a powerful one who feeds without restraint .
tr	2	They seem unconcerned about the loss of their companions or what it could portend for their own chances of survival .
tr	3	Chapter 15 The brothers argue in whispers while I am in the bathroom using a finger to rub toothpaste onto my teeth .
tr	3	He votes in favor of a full night 's sleep on account that neither of them has slept in the past two days .
tr	4	The darkness seems to vibrate , and as I lay in my bed , I mentally explore my new body .
tr	4	" My brother and I have been fighting our whole lives , " Gabe says , " and we 've seen awful things Maya .
tr	4	Afterwards , I curl up on the sidewalk , rocking back and forth and shuddering with the need to keep feeding .
tr	1	Holding his nose , he obliges , and here is what I come up with : This is for Ryan !
tr	1	I see it climbing up the buildings , sneaking under windowsills and lacing dusty cars sitting on the side of the road .
tr	1	Gabe perks up in his seat , and so do I , responding instantly as his aura pulses bright violet streaks .
tr	3	He tosses his bag at me , and I manage to catch it just before it plows into my face .
tr	1	Make up a list of what you need , and I 'll pick it up while I 'm in town . "
tr	0	I gaze out through the windshield , and the only thing I can think is , I already had a home .
tr	0	" We have an ad out on Craigslist for a stuffy British butler , but so far , no luck , " Gabe says .
tr	2	" ... you know , got ta ' have fun with your job , " Gabe is saying behind me .
tr	4	My mind is far away , pinging off book titles , the growing hunger , my mother 's blue eyes .
tr	3	And it 's still night , and I 'm still not tired , and I can 't take this not thinking about stuff anymore .
tr	1	My attention is drawn by leaping sparks of energy all about me and the scents of so many new things .
tr	0	I think I was still in control , and it was only a squirrel after all , a perfectly acceptable snack .
tr	1	What I say out loud is " I 'm fine , I 'm fine , I 'm fine infinity plus one . "
tr	1	This last assertion wins a chuckle from Gabe , but , more importantly , he stops asking me stupid questions .
tr	4	He thinks he 's the leader of the team , but it 's like -- dude , there 's no team .
tr	1	Deep purple humming bird wings are taking flight in his aura , and I think I know where this is going .
tr	1	If you got the right skill set , you can go anywhere , find anything , do anything and never get caught .
tr	0	I find Ryan 's obituary , stare at his face , at that hint of a smile he always teases the camera with .
tr	4	Not when I need just one moment of peace so I can think and close Facebook before I do something truly stupid .
tr	1	They snake all over his body , crisscrossing each other , extending around his torso and down past the waist of his jeans .
tr	0	I don 't think to hide my shock , because I don 't understand how this could have happened to him .
tr	3	Then I realize that I 'm still in his room ; that he 's still staring at me through the mirror .
tr	3	The other noises of the day are a choir of disjointed notes that I 'm learning to sort and dim as best I can .
tr	1	Taught us history and science along with evasive driving , fighting , picking locks , that kind of thing . "
tr	2	" You 're going to okay , you 're going to be okay , " he chants like a mantra .
tr	1	Shivering , trying to force his gaze forward on the road , but inadvertently glancing at his brother over and over again .
tr	3	Without warning he hurls the empty bottle , and it shatters against a tree in a spectacle of exploding glass .
tr	1	The giggles burst out , and Gabe , who is just recovering , falls back on his elbows in fits .
tr	3	Now that I have a perfectly good computer to write with , I have realized that writing is most definitely out of the question .
tr	1	His energy is faded to a thin foggy glow that hugs close to his body and spikes with red and wild yellow jags .
tr	3	I follow his gaze up to the stars , trying to see what 's painting yellow hues into his aura .
tr	4	I am aware of every little flick of movement , the red blush of his pain growing brighter within the flowing blues .
tr	2	They can , I don 't know , go to the movies and complain about it to each other the whole way through . "
tr	4	" Actually , they prefer to be called ' Little People ' , " Gabe corrects , " and little people have big hearts .
tr	4	We drive straight to Arizona , stopping only for gas , restrooms and a pet shop where Gabe buys me three terrified little mice .
tr	2	" It 's for your ... " Gabe takes a deep breath , trying to contain his laughter , " ... your own good .
tr	1	We were hanging around the front trying to think of a way in , and this clown comes driving by .
tr	2	Oh , you look ... " elf eyes filled with mirth , " ... oh god , you look ridiculous . "
tr	2	I know I have to be good about this -- me wallowing here , them going off to kill someone .
tr	3	I write apology letters to Ryan 's family , and this causes sweet torrents of pain to course through me .
tr	2	" Okay , " I say and try to put some power in my voice so it doesn 't come out like a croak .
tr	3	" No one 's going to adopt this guy , " Gabe says as if that could possibly make anything better .
tr	0	You can have as many as you want as long as you don 't let me touch ' em . "
tr	1	The air is cool and crisp , and I hear the hum of an air conditioner vibrating through the walls .
tr	2	I let go of the table , breathe out a long , shuddering sob before slowly turning onto my back .
tr	3	Tender , painful boxes , but at least I can pack them tight in the back of my mind and keep the lights out .
tr	3	I really do want to kill them , and I 'm not sure I have enough strength to stop myself .
tr	3	For the first time , I notice that the song is beautiful -- delicate and powerful at the same time .
tr	1	The last noise for a long time , except for the song which pulls and pulls and the whoosh of cars passing by .
tr	3	A car pulls up in the next spot over , and a little girl hops out of the back seat .
tr	1	So I think about Maya , but Maya is thinking about rabbits , bright little rabbits , so I 'm thinking about rabbits again .
tr	1	Anyone with enough money and the inclination to be part of a new master race could buy their way in . "
tr	1	If you could grab some Aspirin too , while you 're in there , I 'm cramping like crazy . "
tr	0	" You should really clean this thing once in a while , " I toss the hat back at him .
tr	3	I put my gray duffle bag on the bed nearest to the window and unzip it , curious of its contents .
tr	4	His energy field is low and hazy , and reading the exhaustion he tries to hide gives me some pleasure .
tr	3	" But why isn 't the angel moving on or at least spreading out the kills to multiple locations ? "
tr	1	The missing woman is pale as milk , has dark , pretty eyes , round cheeks , and short curls .
tr	4	We don our orange vests , a perfect complement to my hideous straw hat , and make our way into the park .
tr	1	He takes several steps forward , stops , turns to me and says , " Chuck Norris does not sleep .
tr	1	I assess his aura , looking for his true emotions , but , as always , they follow his face .
tr	0	I 'm beginning to twitch again , and I wrap my arms around my body , pressing my hands hard against my ribs .
tr	0	" We leave in half an hour , " he says to Gabe who nods and collapses backward on his bed .
tr	4	I didn 't realize that two minutes could possibly take this long ; that seconds could endeavor to stretch themselves so far before breaking .
tr	0	The gray rabbit stands apart from its huddled companions and stares at me with bright black eyes that seem strangely aware .
tr	4	" I 've been meaning to ask ... " I pull my glove back on , wriggling my fingers through the holes .
tr	3	We almost caught up to him too , but he slipped away just before we got to this huge condo he was staying in .
tr	4	" We learned that he was looking for you -- had hired the best trackers , given them every resource available .
tr	2	You 're biting your lip , and you have this look in your eyes like nothing is going to stop you , not ever .
tr	3	* * * We wander past the fields , past the community garden , past the dog park and into the woods .
tr	4	Each second presses the cold and wet deeper into the center of my bones so that my limbs ache with it .
tr	3	Chapter 37 Leaves slap against me like wet hands , and I 'm charging through roots , twisting around trees without thinking .
tr	2	Stupid , I think and finally , finally realize that an angel was just here , could still be here .
tr	4	I can feel the skin scrolling back , the feeding buds rising from their chambers and throwing out flares of heat .
tr	0	I am aware that all I have to do is stop , turn around and peel these horrible , itchy gloves off my hands .
tr	0	I watch his fingers brush the barrel of his gun , ready to flip it from his holster and shoot .
tr	2	My hands are still glowing , so I press them into my belly and pull my legs up tight to pin them in place .
tr	2	He pulls out shampoo , soap and a clean pair of boxers from the bag and tosses them onto the bed .
tr	3	I realize that he 's actually going to tell me the truth , and I suddenly don 't want to hear it .
tr	0	" He 's so ... so far away and I can 't figure out how to find him and bring him back .
tr	1	" He was , " Gabe says this so soft , I wonder if he meant to say it out loud .
tr	0	* * * When Gabe comes out , he 's in a pair of gray boxers and a ratty undershirt .
tr	3	Dad told her everything , about Thane , about Dr. Cook , about the angels and his mission to kill them .
tr	2	" Okay , but you have to swear not to be all , you know , give me shit about it . "
tr	1	Gabe sighs , and his aura pulses a tangy orange that I 'm beginning to associate with his embarrassment or distress .
tr	0	" Look , I 'm sure Keira Knightly appreciates your daily fan letters , but you can hardly call that a healthy relationship . "
tr	2	So , you know , a guy 's got to get a little nymph love every now and again . "
tr	1	I hit the dial button on my prepaid cell , and the connection trills four times before going to voicemail .
tr	3	* * * Gabe and I sit in the room all day searching for something that will lead us to the angel 's identity .
tr	1	Gabe swings around in his chair , lifts the lounging rabbit off his bed and gives it a big kiss on the forehead .
tr	1	Rain taps against the window trying to get in , and the thick banks of clouds are already diminishing the sunlight .
tr	1	2 -- My own breath running the circuit of my lungs 1 -- The song , haunting in the background .
tr	1	Instead , I feint in and out of the shaggy pine trees lining the road and feel the cool rain sliding down my back .
tr	0	The bulbs are pressing against the fabric of my gloves as I look at the woman , watch her confused aura shiver .
tr	1	And then I turn away , because little Maya is clamoring in my mind , screaming something stupid like you 're in control .
tr	2	It lays close to his body , churning slow like sludge and hued a murky brown almost to the core .
tr	4	The one in the center says : An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind - Ghandi I suppose this is ironic .
tr	1	I sent him and his third wife to a beach in the Caribbean with a hundred grand in his pocket .
tr	4	I walk with purpose into Amber 's room and gaze at the picture of the cheerleaders giggling behind their pompoms .
tr	0	She 's wearing the same blue flannel pajama pants along with an old Strawberry Shortcake t-shirt soaked against her body .
tr	1	I tumble backwards , enfolded in night and shrill wind for a horrifying second before crashing into a branch below .
tr	1	The air isn 't getting into my lungs fast enough , and pain crashes cymbals up and down my arm .
tr	1	I 'm grappling with her wrist , trying to loosen her hand , but she 's stronger than me , much stronger .
tr	1	Thoughts are backing up in my mind , crashing into each other as the knots of panic tie off reason .
tr	0	I hear her body smack against a branch and then a final thump as it hits the soft ground below .
tr	4	Her arm is twisted behind her , and she looks like a broken doll some careless child dropped and forgot to put away .
tr	4	When he does , I notice the slightest dip in the vehicle as he lays her body down in the trunk .
tr	4	" Sometimes I do , but I 'm beginning to realize that I can never hate you more than you hate yourself . "
tr	0	After a half hour online , Gabe shuts down his computer , runs a hand through his drying hair and turns off the lamp .
tr	0	All that other stuff , gangs and war , well , I figure those are human problems and humans can solve them . "
tr	4	I haven 't written anything since that night except for imaginary letters asking for a forgiveness I will never earn .
tr	1	Tears of relief drip down my face , or maybe it 's terror , or some strange , sad mixture .
tr	3	The hiccups are dying down , but my heart takes over , kicking hard in my chest , testing the integrity of my ribs .
tr	1	At least the sky is clear , and the sun is streaming down , soaking into my skin and soothing my raw hunger .
tr	4	" We confirm if Hendricks is on the premise and if he 's alone , and then we pull back . "
tr	3	It 's a pretty crappy camo job , but I 'll trust in Gabe 's philosophy that people don 't notice jack shit .
tr	0	" Check , " I reply as gruffly as I can , even though I don 't know how far away 300 yards is .
tr	3	They have a technique for this that I have not yet learned , but I wonder at the thoughts that cross their minds .
tr	0	One is tall and brawny , wearing a torn muscle shirt and a pair of skinny jeans that suck against his powerful legs .
tr	4	The other human , the one who managed to keep his feet , bends down and pulls his companion up .
tr	4	Now the paint is peeling , the window shutters are crooked , and the place looks -- in three words -- spooky as hell .
tr	2	My voice trails off as I look around the foyer , which seems to be functioning as some sort of spider web sanctuary .
tr	0	I 'm not wearing a watch , and it takes me a moment to realize what he 's talking about .
tr	1	I wonder if I should sit down , but since he hasn 't invited me , I just keep standing in the doorway .
tr	0	The phone is on its last chord of the Macarena when I take it from his hand and accept the call .
tr	3	Of course , this doesn 't actually make any better sense , but I don 't give it much thought .
tr	4	* * * Employment Interview with a Vampire , a short story by J Bennett , is available for purchase on Smashwords .
tr	2	For Edith Without you I would not see nor hear nor talk ... and definitely , I would not write .
tr	3	" OK , " Taylor hesitated , " Just make sure you stay downwind from me after the third day of the trip . "
tr	3	" Right , you do that , you have yet to earn your keep on this trip , " Taylor teased .
tr	0	All I am asking for is a full tank of gas for my airplane and maybe two or three weeks of Safe Passage Certificates .
tr	2	If you want a scanner you will have to take along one of my boys to make sure you bring back something useful .
tr	4	She had lost two sons a long time ago in unexplained plane crashes so she treated the flight crews as her own children .
tr	4	" John , come in , " Mary 's face lighted up , " can I get you a cup of coffee ? "
tr	2	' It 's still going to be a good hour before we have enough light to get going , ' he thought to himself .
tr	2	Obviously he was not accustomed to carrying female passengers who frowned upon the idea of having to crawl out of a car window .
tr	4	When the fuel truck had left , Taylor opened the engine cowl and started with the preflight inspection of his airplane .
tr	2	" It 's going to be five hours until you 'll get another chance , so who needs a bathroom ?
tr	3	At the same time this allowed him to disregard almost every other rule that civilian flights have to contend with .
tr	2	You are not going to need it unless you complain during the flight and we have to throw you out .
tr	3	Hunt was in the right seat next to Taylor and already had the checklist out to go through the startup procedure .
tr	3	" Thanks Ma , " Taylor answered , " roger that , only one nut job flying at this hour .
tr	3	< Time Warp > The twenty-first century with its vast technological and scientific advancements was just about to be called history .
tr	2	The opportunity for near total control of the masses through the power of influence was too enticing to be passed over .
tr	2	A simple act of courage born out of rage , life giving rage to shake off the shackles of information slavery .
tr	4	Little Suzie 's outcry was discussed in Internet forums and blog websites gaining her the inevitable air of heroism along the way .
tr	1	In an act of civic defiance twenty-four girls got together in the school gymnasium and disabled their own computer 's networking facilities .
tr	3	He had intercepted the reports flying back and forth between Salt Lake City and Washington , D.C. about their little Girl Scout Revolution .
tr	4	The intuition that a good intelligence operative brought to the table could never be matched to a satisfactory degree by the machines .
tr	1	" Well , we don 't need a panic , so calm down and turn off the warning bells . "
tr	2	Find out who posted the message and inform the ground force commander in D.C. as soon as you get closer .
tr	2	Rachel found the row of books she was looking for and picked up one on American history reaching back many centuries .
tr	0	" Gather around everybody , we will learn today what it was like to be in a class room many decades ago .
tr	2	Bring your chairs to the front and sit down , we are going to learn from a real book today . "
tr	4	The old trusty engine droned its reassuring song propelling the travelers across the sky at a comfortable altitude of five thousand feet .
tr	3	He was hoping to find the turnoff to US Highway 65 to follow it as far as their fuel would get them .
tr	3	It was not long until they saw Lake Maumelle stretching out on the horizon and the Arkansas River Valley right behind it .
tr	4	A lonely low flying plane that was going north might raise some questions , which he was not prepared to answer .
tr	0	It was time to think about more practical things than an ever so pleasant chance encounter in a cramped airplane back seat .
tr	3	Must have been quite a resilient fellow , " Taylor said to Hunt pointing at the road that disappeared into the forest .
tr	3	Better to be safe than sorry was their motto even in a remote location like this , just an old habit .
tr	3	The four travelers sat down on scattered rocks to have a light snack from their military rations that they had brought for food .
tr	1	They settled into a comfortable rhythm of walking a ways and then exploring the surroundings and picking up the hike again .
tr	2	Hunt and Farmer kept dashing on and off the road into the woods like little kids who had too much energy to burn .
tr	3	They all filled their aluminum canteens with nature 's gift and drank as much as they could right on the spot .
tr	0	" We can take the easier way down on the backside of the hill and make our way around back to the road .
tr	4	Only seconds later the fire from his lighter had spread to the larger branches while he added more wood to the pile .
tr	2	No sir , he knew how to live and to survive in the outdoors and how to have a good time along the way .
tr	4	With their stomachs full and sipping the remaining coffee they all settled around the fire contemplating the events of the day .
tr	3	More than twenty years ago the Southern Coalition had gained stable control of the gulf coast and all the way up to Austin .
tr	0	I was a young pilot with the militia , all green and eager to prove what an ace I was .
tr	1	He was moving so swiftly that I never saw him until I felt my own 45 being pressed into my back .
tr	0	" My credentials as Special Operations Officer at the time gave me access to almost any official building or installation .
tr	4	Times were so messed up back then that the night security grunt did not even flinch and let me have my pick .
tr	4	Twenty seconds later we hear three clicks as answer and right in front of me landing lights flicker in the middle of a field .
tr	4	They helped quite a few lost pilots out of a jam and made good business out of recycling the planes they left behind .
tr	0	Come noon the plane had a brand new identity with papers and all , was filled up and ready to go .
tr	4	The four travelers had followed the remains of what was once US Highway 377 west higher into the Ozark Mountains .
tr	3	It was quite out of character for him to grant anyone let alone a stranger an ever so brief glance into his private thoughts .
tr	3	" Hey , what are you talking about , " Spade started to argue but Taylor motioned her to let it go .
tr	2	" Follow me , " Lilly Ann announced very importantly , " I shall take you to my leader ! "
tr	4	" Sure , " she said easily , smiling at them briefly and turning back to her water ripple game .
tr	3	Taylor did not want to appear too desperate but he thought it would help his cause to relay the big picture .
tr	4	Once we have the sample data it will be analyzed and synthesized into the reproductive cycle of the various herds .
tr	3	" He looks smarter than to try to mess with God 's hand writing , " she teased in Farmer 's direction .
tr	4	" Right , " Taylor sighed , " we are authorized to offer you a substantial sum of energy credits for helping us . "
tr	1	" No , no , I don 't know what an energy credit is , but I sure don 't want any of that .
tr	2	" The girl is warming up , " Hunt noted , " mostly to our young cowboy , though . "
tr	3	There was a wider road leading to the left and to the right but still no sign of a town or village .
tr	4	Just a short distance further on the other side of the street an old Jeep vehicle was parked next to the road .
tr	3	" Farmer is going to like this , " Hunt pointed at the car , " looks older than dirt , though . "
tr	2	" Hungry for Lilly Ann , " Hunt mocked ducking out of reach to avoid Taylor 's punch at his ribcage .
tr	4	The two friends made their way back to the camp discussing the unexpected events they had witnessed on the journey so far .
tr	3	Cody Hunt could not retreat quickly enough to escape an angry fountain of cold water that Spade tossed at him .
tr	4	Every piece of sheet metal and the occasional wood panel were painted in bright colors with paisley and floral designs .
tr	0	" Let 's find a table and get some food , " Lilly Ann ushered them to a vacant spot and sat down .
tr	1	" We can 't complain about a lack of diners every night , " Lilly Ann kind of not answered the question .
tr	0	Everyone around the table laughed at her out of character remark as they all knew exactly what she was talking about .
tr	0	Mi casa tu casa , " she added after a short pause with deeper meaning in her words than was obvious .
tr	2	This time he did not have to search the woods for partridge or quail eggs to cook up his specialty .
tr	3	To his delight a good fairy had left a wicker basket full of breakfast treasures in front of their camp during the night hours .
tr	4	he greeted them cheerfully while with the skill of an accomplished short order cook he quickly broke the eggs into the pan .
tr	4	Suddenly there was laughter and chatting and all of them were wondering about the strange place they had landed in .
tr	4	The five of them boarded the van the same way as they had done the day before and with great noise they drove off .
tr	1	Taylor rolled his eyes , " Yes , it is very pretty , did you paint it with nail polish ? "
tr	3	The place in front of the house and all the way up to the barns that stood aside was buzzing with activity .
tr	0	Only Tim Farmer did not seem to mind and eagerly jumped out of the car as soon as it came to a halt .
tr	2	" Oh , I would love to , " she played along , " but I don 't think you could handle me .
tr	3	" It 's in the noggin , junior , you should try it sometime , just a little basic math , right ? "
tr	4	Taylor had heard the engine enough to know that a simple carburetor adjustment was not going to make much of a difference .
tr	1	Why did you let me start to begin with if you didn 't believe I could finish the job ? "
tr	3	She did not waste one thought to the fact that the car was not really broken before he had started to take it apart .
tr	2	It turned out that many of the farm 's utility rooms still had very old linoleum floors hidden under rugs or wood panels .
tr	2	She quickly shut off the motor gesturing apologetic to the people who had run out of the buildings to see what was going on .
tr	4	When Taylor and Lilly Ann returned to the farm from their little joy ride Frank Turner greeted them in front of the main building .
tr	4	A slight shade of red merged into his healthy tan when he saw the amused nods and smiles around the table .
tr	4	It was an intense but short celebration , for the travelers ' minds were already set on the road that laid ahead .
tr	2	What a glorious , wondrous and enriching visit it had been with the forgotten people of the mountains of Oz .
tr	0	He pushed Farmer out the door with his left hand while holding on to the control stick with his right .
tr	1	It disappeared behind a mountain ridge out of their sight leaving a dark billowing trail of smoke in the sky .
tr	4	He can take care of himself , " he barked , " we came out of situations much worse than this all right before .
tr	4	They were able to increase their pace and reached the spot where Hunt had thought they would find Farmer some two hours later .
tr	3	Fifteen days after that fateful lightning strike the trio was back in their familiar surroundings ready to start their new lives .
tr	3	They both heard the plane slowly settling onto the trees , breaking through the crowns with great fanfare and slicing to the ground .
tr	3	They used the branches they had cut some days before to build a stretcher , strong but light and pillow soft .
tr	2	It looked as if one could just break off a piece and stick it into one 's mouth for a quick snack or desert .
tr	3	They both sat quietly for a moment with their eyes closed , trying to get back to the lighter beginning of their conversation .
tr	4	" Yes , Lilly Ann , I remember , " he was fighting for words before sinking back to sleep .
tr	4	You look hungry , " she changed the subject , " Grandpa brought a wonderful chicken soup with little meat dumplings .
tr	4	" I need to see a doctor , " Taylor insisted , " I need to know what 's wrong with my legs . "
tr	4	Her feet found the slippers they were searching for as she got up to greet the first visitor of the day .
tr	1	" That 's good , " Edie May said confidently , " he ate , slept and his mind is working .
tr	0	Bread and butter , ham and honey , strawberries and tea appeared on a serving tray next to Taylor 's bed .
tr	4	For the second time in as many days Taylor felt the undeniable positive effect the food had on his general wellbeing .
tr	1	" Thank you for tending to my burns and scrapes and of course for putting me up and feeding me .
tr	1	Lilly Ann had spent the night in her own bedroom upstairs confident that her house guest would be all right on his own .
tr	3	The soothing splatter of water drops against the bedroom window made the fact that he was confined to this small room almost bearable .
tr	0	She was back a moment later triumphantly holding a small dented metal can in her hand with a faded almost unreadable label .
tr	2	He watched Lilly Ann carefully peel back the plastic lid from the coffee can and pull the aluminum lid open .
tr	4	A small hiss of air rushing into the can told them that the vacuum seal had not been broken before .
tr	3	He knew that there was a method to this madness and he was determined to find out what it was .
tr	4	" Cause he will be out fishing with his buddies all the time , " she lectured running out of the room .
tr	4	Actually , there were some disappointed readers when she missed two weeks while she was playing with you and your friends at the farms .
tr	3	The electric discharge at their touch could have lit up a room , it definitely lit up Taylor 's face .
tr	2	" I don 't know , " Lilly Ann said slowly while reluctantly relinquishing the issue of the Chronicle to Taylor .
tr	3	It took all of Taylor 's self control to hide the tears that were flooding his eyes when he saw that last picture .
tr	2	" I am so glad you like my quirky sense of humor , I really am , " Lilly Ann said relieved .
tr	4	" I knew that he would ask , " she squealed in delight , " I told you Edie May .
tr	3	Edie May got the impression that she was losing Taylor quickly to the esoteric direction this talk was veering off to .
tr	3	In fact , it is always the interplay of a number of vibrational frequencies that provide the information for matter to be formed .
tr	3	The manifestation that you attract with your thoughts will call forth the exact same emotional reaction from you , every single time .
tr	3	This is what Lilly Ann meant when she said , ' The most important thing is that I feel good . '
tr	3	Taylor didn 't know if this was too much or too little information but he was burning to get some answers either way .
tr	3	" I don 't like the sound of it but you could see it that way , " Taylor conceded .
tr	0	" I have something for you to look at , John , " Lilly Ann said with a glance at Edie May .
tr	1	printed on it and announced in big letters , " Nothing is more important than that I feel good ! "
tr	0	He has an inner hamster that guides him and he learned a whole lot from studying the Abraham books and recordings .
tr	4	Her face lit up as she remembered the most basic truth she had come to believe from before she could remember .
tr	1	" Of course there is a great variety and variation in describing emotions so we have to simplify a little .
tr	4	Another way to describe it would be the feeling of freedom and self-empowerment on one end , and bondage or powerlessness on the other .
tr	4	This one is just frustrated and then he is hopeful and then he stands on his head because he thinks he can do everything .
tr	1	" I did many of the drawings , " Lilly Ann confirmed , " but they are not really mine .
tr	3	" There is nothing I can do about that , " Lilly Ann stated , " That 's what it 's called . "
tr	0	As much as the thought of his condition pained him , he was not going to ruin this game for her .
tr	3	Taylor started to feel a little under siege with all the attention he was getting and the activity that filled his room with life .
tr	2	Soon it was standing room only and some of the people who had just arrived yelled over the crowd to partake .
tr	0	It was getting late and Lilly Ann was signaling that it was time to call it a day and maybe continue another time .
tr	1	Lilly Ann rushed down the stairs to find Taylor sitting up in his bed rubbing his legs and feet frantically .
tr	3	Mr. Big had taken a liking to his feet and was just about to start nibbling at them when Taylor opened his eyes .
tr	2	The cupboards all around the walls were filled with an eclectic collection of mugs and pots and glasses of all imaginable forms and colors .
tr	1	She looked at him with that curious smile as if she was trying to figure out how his mind worked .
tr	2	" Why would you want to think about an empty coffee can when you have a full one right in front of you ? "
tr	2	" So John , " Edie May acknowledged Taylor 's newfound mobility , " what are you doing up and about without adult supervision .
tr	2	They are doing a very good job showing their best vibe faces from yucky to hamster euphoria , don 't you think ? "
tr	1	" This is Sudbury , " Lilly Ann clarified , " most of our youngsters come here to exchange questions and find answers .
tr	2	The activity level in this room was much more subdued with only an occasional opening of the door for someone walking in or out .
tr	4	Many of them furthered that knowledge with their asking and listening for answers to a level never before attained by human kind .
tr	4	She loved animals and for long periods of her life she chose her place of residence next to the zoo .
tr	1	Not knowing why and how , they would rendezvous within a short period of time in the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas . "
tr	3	" I bet you know the answer to that question even though you might not believe it yet , right John ? "
tr	4	Abraham started and the audience agreed , " Imagine standing at the edge of a river , a quickly flowing powerful river .
tr	3	You have a boat with ores attached to the sides and you place the boat into the river and you start paddling upstream .
tr	3	Still , our dear friends , this is exactly what most humans , if not all of them , do .
tr	2	When we ask you , ' Why don 't you let go of the ores and go with the flow ? '
tr	4	" This does go against everything I have ever heard before , but it is exactly what my life was like .
tr	0	In front of them appeared an archway that was cut into a dense wall of hazel shrubs that still bore a few catkins .
tr	3	After three or four repetitions he let the bait soar across the water with a fluid motion of his wrist .
tr	0	Taylor was not yet satisfied with Lilly Ann 's reasoning , " What about literature and math and history and geography ?
tr	4	" Maybe , " Lilly Ann replied vaguely , " but for the students here there are no required studies or subjects .
tr	4	For every question there will be an answer but if there is no desire to learn there will be no desire to teach .
tr	0	With its flat side facing the sky it provided a wide and safe platform reaching half way across the water .
tr	3	He did the same with the other steps and in no time he triumphantly joined Lilly Ann at the top .
tr	1	Lilly Ann danced around him singing and laughing , " You did it , I knew it , you did it . "
tr	3	It 's all about wanting something to get the stream going and then going with the flow to allow it into your experience . "
tr	1	" I love it , " he said enthusiastically , " you are a strange cookie , did you know this ? "
tr	3	Then we relax into that idea and let the river carry us to that , and on and on it goes .
tr	4	He didn 't seem to mind the time that had passed since any of the fish showed interest for his lures .
tr	4	Still , the more he read and intellectually understood of the philosophical foundation the town was built on , the more restless he became .
tr	4	" It 's what we all do , " Lilly Ann had a neck of making the most incredulous statements sound self-evident .
tr	3	" So , what if I realize that I don 't want to go with the choice that Lilly made ? "
tr	3	The only thing that matters is , that they answer without hesitation and without actively thinking about the issue at hand .
tr	2	" That 's only for you to know , " the answer was always the same , " or you could ask Lilly . "
tr	3	Most of us hadn 't paid much attention before , to the idea of living without knowing what we know . "
tr	2	It 's like , I do something for you , and then you must be happy , for me to be happy .
tr	0	He shook his head , and with much conviction he added , " Church is boring and saints are dead . "
tr	3	Both of them nodded , sipped their martini cocktails and enjoyed the sound of critters getting warmed up for their nightly concert .
tr	4	" No , seriously , " Edie May 's tone of voice changed , " your quest even inspired a new children 's game .
tr	3	" Neat , " Lilly Ann interrupted , " I have to come to Sudbury some time to play it with the kids .
tr	0	She looked at him , her head cocked , holding her bear and curling a strand of her auburn hair with the other hand .
tr	3	" I don 't know what this is , " Taylor admitted , " but I am sure you can teach me . "
tr	1	So he just sat back on his favorite chair in the kitchen and smiled knowingly , and a lot of good that did him .
tr	3	" I never really thought about it , " Taylor admitted , " What would you like to see me in ? "
tr	4	We could meet for lunch here in the early afternoon , that gives us plenty of time to get ready for the evening . "
tr	1	He found the kitchen empty , a sandwich waiting for him on the table and a note in Lilly Ann 's childlike handwriting .
tr	4	He undressed and put on his borrowed bathrobe to tend to his personal hygiene in Lilly Ann 's bath shed .
tr	2	It never occurred to him to ask how or why , it was just a luxurious convenience that he took for granted .
tr	3	He thoroughly enjoyed the manly ritual , which gave him the daily opportunity to reconnect with his masculine character traits .
tr	3	The upper part of the black dress pants was cut so close to his body that they looked as if painted on .
tr	4	Lilly Ann looked deep into his eyes searching for a sign that he understood the deeper meaning of the last words he had spoken .
tr	2	" Don 't sound so surprised , " she whispered , " you don 't look too bad yourself , you know ? "
tr	3	Stepping down the last of the stairs she added , " Just pray that I don 't kill myself with those heels .
tr	4	They were called Cadillac and this specific model did not have a roof and its rear fenders were shaped like shark fins .
tr	0	" Just in case you need a break from Lilly Ann , " was added with a jovial wink more than once .
tr	0	Well , there isn 't one anyway , as long as I can remember it was always today , every day . "
tr	4	A cocoon of movement and laughter and song created an intimate place for new feelings to be discovered and explored .
tr	1	The first touch of their lips , light like a feather , sent waves of tingling electricity through their bodies and minds alike .
tr	1	" This morning , I made it , this , " Lilly Ann answered his questions and pointed at her chest .
tr	1	" I have a feeling that this is going to be a wild ride , " Taylor said with raised eyebrows .
tr	1	He had earned his share of blank stares , annoyed looks as well as amused outbursts from pitying smiles to all out laughing fits .
tr	2	Even small children would go into dark rooms and just clap their hands twice and the lights would come on .
tr	2	Edie May was trying not to show her amusement too obviously , " Even the little ones know how to do it . "
tr	2	" None of us would be able to turn on one light bulb if we ever thought about the why and how .
tr	0	" Sure , " said Taylor , always eager to learn more about his new hometown , " what is Wal Star ? "
tr	3	Turning the corner to the loading dock they spotted Tom sitting on one of the platforms seemingly in deep meditation .
tr	4	" No , no , " Tom disagreed , " you came here after all , didn 't you ? "
tr	2	" That 's some interesting logic , " Taylor shook his head , " but if it works for you I won 't argue .
tr	0	Someone had made drawings of both units a long time ago and we always went by them to fix it .
tr	4	" We have all kinds of tools , " Tom confirmed proudly , " I don 't think they have ever been used . "
tr	4	The first few explosions sent thick black clouds from the smoke stack but after only a few seconds the engine ran smoothly and quietly .
tr	4	Taylor began to notice that fewer people crossed his way on his walks and whenever he was out with Lilly Ann .
tr	4	Was he really so insecure that he needed other people to need him , even if it was just to fix their stuff ?
tr	0	She was wondering what made him change his mind and she got curious when she heard him rummaging in the back yard .
tr	4	" I know , " he conceded , " but I had the impression that people started to avoid me .
tr	0	He ran to the tractor , yanked off half a bail of hay from the cabin and jumped into driver 's seat .
tr	4	People who had been watching the proceedings with open mouths from a safe distance rushed in to retrieve Frank Turner from his trap .
tr	1	" I think David tried to tell you when you went into the barn , " Lilly Ann grinned at him with raised eyebrows .
tr	0	Lilly Ann could not stop laughing at Taylor 's incredulous face and stuttering attempts to find a reasonable explanation for what had happened .
tr	3	That night on his way to bed , Taylor clapped off the lights and kissed Lilly Ann , " Good night . "
tr	0	It was always a fun time to get together with a few friends for a guessing game around a bottle of Schnapps .
tr	2	" Call me old fashioned , " Taylor smiled , " but the thought of formally proposing had crossed my mind .
tr	0	" No thanks necessary , " Fritz smiled at him , " you make an old man very happy . "
tr	4	Magically , one after the other , the family sized food containers disappeared from her kitchen table before the evening turned into night .
tr	1	" Mm , " was the first thing he said walking into the kitchen , " something smells delicious . "
tr	1	" Not in a million years , " Lilly Ann burst out laughing , " Don 't get your hopes up .
tr	1	" Really , " Lilly Ann asked , " what 's on your mind to keep that in mind ? "
tr	3	" Let 's eat first , " Taylor suggested , " this really smells too delicious to be kept waiting . "
tr	2	" No , not really , " Taylor admitted , " it just felt good for a moment to blame someone else . "
tr	3	He paused for a moment to gather his thoughts , " One thing you might want to keep in mind , John .
tr	2	" You 'll figure it out , we are all rooting for you , " he said and went on his way .
tr	0	Lilly Ann was royally amused by Taylor 's attempt to be inconspicuous , " What did they have to say ? "
tr	2	For the first time in his life he did not worry about tomorrow , or today , or anything about his past .
tr	0	Short cut dark brown hair adorned by a thin reef of braided silver strands framed a face that was foreign and familiar at once .
tr	3	She had to put up a mighty fight to not laugh out loud at the bewildered look on Taylor 's face .
tr	3	" Cut it out mom , " She scolded the older woman , " don 't scare him away just yet . "
tr	0	They both laughed and hugged as the woman 's appearance solidified as if nothing unusual had transpired in the last few moments .
tr	2	She took Taylor 's hand in both of hers , " I am Lilly Grace , Lilly Ann 's mother . "
tr	2	You didn 't think we would miss out on a chance to have our own fun , did you ? "
tr	3	Not wanting to further flame his sister 's wrath he cautiously drove out into the street and out of town .
tr	2	We brought food and drink for about two hundred and it 's just a short ride into town if we need more . "
tr	3	It took him the better part of an hour to cross the meadow to his designated place at the head of the table .
tr	2	Lower and lower she crouched until all that was left of her was a convulsing billowing white cloud in the darkness .
tr	0	Taylor was amazed how little information he could gather about Lilly Ann 's father despite the many questions he had asked .
tr	3	" I will never forget this night , " Taylor said to Willie as they parted , " Thank you so much ! "
tr	2	" Yes , I liked what I saw , " Taylor answered truthfully , " but I really love this . "
tr	3	" A silver bird dropped me out of the sky , for my darkest night to give way to my brightest day .
tr	1	Taylor kissed Lilly Ann 's hand , " I love you , " and slipped her grandmother 's wedding band onto her finger .
tr	0	" It was my happiest day too - so far , " she added , falling asleep in Taylor 's embrace .
tr	3	Now it seems that he is going to bask in that reverberation a little longer , but his time has certainly come . "
tr	1	" I 'm not sure I understand your enthusiasm , " Taylor frowned , " I always enjoyed having the old man around . "
tr	3	" I don 't know , " he said still skeptical , " all of this sounds a bit too weird for my taste .
tr	3	" Pull up a chair , John , " Fritz started , " wan na try my latest concoction too ? "
tr	1	A soft glow had settled upon him and his words were directed as much inwards as they were addressing his visitors .
tr	4	His features seemed almost translucent and the touch of his skin felt like an afterthought to the person he once was .
tr	3	The time had come to end this particular conversation , anticipating to pick up the next one right where they had left off .
tr	4	Somewhere in them , around them or associated with them was Fritz , having fun with them all over again .
tr	4	As the crowd turned towards her and calmed down a bit her clear voice was heard to the last place in the house .
tr	0	" Grandpa says , ' Hi ' , " she said , " and he thanks you all for coming .
tr	0	" Do you have any idea what grandpa could have meant when he said , ' Tell John to not forget our pact . '
tr	3	" Just before my little speech , " Lilly Ann said as if that was the most natural thing in the world .
tr	1	The only thing we both knew was that we wanted to know and to understand beyond the conventional avenues of learning and reasoning .
tr	2	I had to hold him and calm him down for almost an hour before we were able to talk about it . "
tr	2	Taylor had one more question that he almost did not dare to ask for the answer might be too much to comprehend .
tr	3	Taylor had an innate knowing of the answer to this question but he so much wanted to hear it spoken by another .
tr	2	" In that light , shouldn 't we do something to clean up and expand our vocabulary , so to speak ? "
tr	1	It 's like with music that thrives on tension and relief , rhythm , harmony and disharmony , noise and pure tone .
tr	4	After a short pause she added , " It never hurts to let more fun into your life , though .
tr	1	" All part of the service , " he stated with military precision before cracking into his widest little boy smile on tap .
tr	1	As Wilbur grew older he got increasingly impatient with the bounds of gravity , which tied him to the ground .
tr	3	He was convinced that all would go according to plan if he just found the right amount of explosives to light underneath his feet .
tr	0	' Can happen to the best of us , ' Wilbur thought while he promised himself not to miss his chance this time .
tr	3	Fascinated beyond measure , Wilbur took mentally picture after picture of the intricate construction of this light and sturdy design .
tr	1	" I 'd rather you stop calling me sir , Wilbur , " Taylor said , " And no , I don 't mind .
tr	4	" All here , " Wilbur pulled back a tarp covering the salvaged engine and the deflated but intact main wheels .
tr	3	" Did you do any stress tests on the wings and tail to see if it 'll hold together ? "
tr	3	The plane was almost finished were it not for that little detail that they had conveniently avoided to even discuss .
tr	2	" We have to look at this mess sooner or later , " he fought for encouragement for the both of them .
tr	4	" We are missing about a third of an engine , " Taylor concluded as he went over the list again .
tr	1	" It 's balanced in all directions too , " Wilbur explained , " to a fiftieth of an ounce . "
tr	1	" You are full of surprises my friend , " Taylor said full of admiration for his resourceful and ingenious protégé .
tr	4	An approving gasp could be heard from people who had not seen the airplane before as it appeared in the gleaming midday sun .
tr	3	In a crisscross pattern that was ingrained into his brain from many repetitions Taylor tightened the bolts of the propeller assembly .
tr	4	The two pilots stood next to the plane and went over the tasks to be performed and over the flight plan one more time .
tr	4	The beautiful wooden propeller sung its song driven by the ingeniously resurrected motor , propelling the craft faster and faster .
tr	2	There was ample room in front of them so Taylor forced the plane to stay on the ground for just a few seconds longer .
tr	2	Taylor had enjoyed Wilbur 's show of talent immensely and with waving thumbs up to his copilot he took back control of the craft .
tr	3	" No , not at all , " Taylor shook his head , " that was the best decision of my entire life .
tr	0	I find myself calculating flight plans to Texas and back here and I don 't know how I should feel about this . "
tr	1	" I can imagine that you miss your friends , " Lilly Ann nodded , " I know , I would .
tr	3	If I could just give them a small foothold to get going , that might make all the difference for them .
tr	4	All we ever have to do to live a more pleasant and satisfying experience is to find thoughts that make us feel better .
tr	3	" Wow , " Taylor was taken aback , " I didn 't know that you feel so strongly about this . "
tr	3	" Right , " Taylor smiled , " if I do then I might be part of the problem and not the solution .
tr	1	She pulled Taylor inside the house , her face glowing with an unfamiliar intensity and kissed him passionately on the lips .
tr	3	" No , that 's not it , " Lilly Ann huffed and lowered her dress much to Taylor 's dismay .
tr	2	" Sit down , apparently we have to do this the grownup way , " she was not happy about his slow comprehension .
tr	1	" I don 't know , " Taylor began , but Lilly Ann put his hand on top of her belly .
tr	1	The shift in weight and direction of their discussions was invigorating on the one hand but slightly confusing all the while .
tr	1	" Abraham 's little sister , " she said simply , " Leila is my spirit guide , my inner being .
tr	3	Its warmth and comfort swept across the barren land of despair and showed her the path out of this false jungle of thoughts .
tr	3	Now he was starting a family and he had made up his mind that he would get to the bottom of this .
tr	1	" No , it is not , granted , " Taylor answered , " I am going back and forth on the issue .
tr	2	" Lilly Ann said the same thing , ask Lilly , but can I really put that on her ? "
tr	4	It wasn 't so much that she changed , really , she just became more of herself in every way .
tr	2	Not before you teach me how to swim , to ride , to dance , to fly and to love .
tr	1	I was almost 100 % positive that the Fleet Air Arm had never operated Hawker Hunters from its aircraft carriers .
tr	0	So far no one had abused the situation and bent my ear , but I daresay it was bound to happen one day .
tr	1	Teddy was just starting his second alcohol laden Guinness and third ' mind blowing ' dessert when it finally sank in .
tr	2	I looked along the line of aircraft and thought ' one down , three to go ' and clambered out .
tr	0	He , the man in Switzerland , had just had a phone call from a lady , also in Switzerland .
tr	0	' You didn 't ask ' she snapped , and disappeared inside , I was already starting to like her .
tr	0	First his favourite Uncle passed away and left him a tidy bit of money and a nice chalet up in the mountains .
tr	3	It was brilliant news , Topsy and I had been trying to work out how to get the Hunter out .
tr	4	We revived her and then I mercilessly continued , ' and that does not include ' top dollar ' for your home ' .
tr	3	Later that evening I sat in the cockpit of my new ' best friend ' and had a long chat with her .
tr	0	He had a few more words with the pilot and was out again , with a look of absolute amazement on his face .
tr	0	' Most likely her auto-pilot ' he said with a straight face ' you 've never flown a Russian aircraft have you ' .
tr	1	Supervisors would of course be supervised closely by the Officers , and the mechanics would call all Officers and Supervisors ' Sir ' .
tr	0	I watched her give a phenomenal display , and then plop down on the taxi track just in front of ' A ' hangar .
tr	2	Carol was just about to ' hang a right ' ( move slowly to starboard ) when he said ' oh ho ' .
tr	3	It was the waste of a beautiful aeroplane but those ' dummy ' guns were just a little too realistic for my liking .
tr	0	On either side of its fuselage , just aft of the parasol wing , the Catalina had a large glass bubble .
tr	1	The first person that Harry rang when he arrived on board was his brother , who was a Special Forces ' Ranger ' .
tr	0	It rang , which was very unusual as not many people know my number , but Maria had apparently put this call through .
tr	1	As she slowly regained consciousness she did just as her David had taught her , she didn 't move , or make a sound .
tr	1	As she sat there regaining full consciousness she started using what senses that she had available to her to assess the situation .
tr	4	Zoomer was into making specialised movies ; they were called snuff movies , where the principle participant was killed on camera .
tr	4	When her husband ( s ) returned from their successful trip , she asked them for a belated birthday present .
tr	4	She accepted the limitations of her life style and settled down to re-assemble her mother 's stud farm , electronically .
tr	0	She gave him all the details of how to get into several large banking organisations , and how to create accounts , backwards .
tr	2	Then , to the obvious delight of both Zoomer 's he lowered his pistol , but not all the way down .
tr	2	When Charlie told him ' his ' solution to that problem , instructions on how to disable the reader were quickly forthcoming .
tr	4	' First off ' interrupted the Head of Internal Affairs , ' Weapon and shield on the table - now ' .
tr	0	' Yes , and the Ambulance , and the Police , and one of our cameras has caught it all on disc ' .
tr	0	One scaffolding pole had slammed into the small of her back and another one had caught the back of her head .
tr	4	Topsy then flung open the end doors and just inside we could make out the gleaming nose of a Mark 6D Hawker Hunter .
tr	1	The crowd control barriers paid only lip service to crowd control and an ecstatic crowd surged forward , heading towards her aircraft .
tr	2	Margaret and Gerald had fallen in love with Spanish Morocco on their honeymoon World tour , and got no further .
tr	0	Fortunately she was just making landfall after flying across the Med from Melilla and there in front of her was El Campo .
tr	0	As I always finish off my showers with a blast of cold water , it wasn 't going to be a very big perk .
tr	3	and transport me stylishly to the Pavilion , this was the ultra-modern shore side facility for members of the club .
tr	3	As Carol returned the courtesy I nodded over the intervening water to the Captain and thought ' size is important ' .
tr	3	Its colour signified that its contents were not earth shattering , but it contained information that I was very interested in .
tr	2	It looked abandoned so he decided to continue on with his supply drop but would investigate further on his way back .
tr	4	came the voice down the phone , and then David started to seriously interrogate him , although poor Mr. Peters didn 't realize it .
tr	0	Andrew Michaels ( AKA Santa Claus ) p.s. please find enclose an aerial photograph that may be of interest to you .
tr	2	, then I had one of my ideas , how about as my personal helicopter pilot , although I didn 't actually own one .
tr	3	Then it was down to the logistics of actually getting them out of Morocco , and a rough plan quickly came together .
tr	1	' If you wouldn 't mind filling the rest of it in for me at your leisure I would be much obliged .
tr	3	It turned out that he had flown Phantoms in the post war Luftwaffe and he cried like a baby throughout the entire flight .
tr	0	' Marcus ' I said ' please wait a moment ' and indicating a vacant chair I said ' take a seat ' .
tr	3	Slightly bemused he sat down , but looked forward to the opportunity of watching the ' powers that be ' in their deliberations .
tr	2	He stopped in front of me , opened his mouth to say something , took a look around , and changed his mind .
tr	3	' Perhaps a visit to your office might be in order ' she suggested , and left it at that .
tr	2	' You are joking ' I shouted at his back ' I don 't like anyone well enough to do that ' .
tr	4	To me it had just been a means to an end , but apparently to her it had been a life changing moment .
tr	1	Every Thursday Lady Hyacinth 's four star restaurant , the one hidden under the mezzanine floor was up and running for business .
tr	0	She gave me a scowl , but didn 't make any comment , although was that a hint of a blush on her cheeks ?
tr	0	' Well -- do you want abstract , contemporary , classical , impressionist , art deco , fantasy , minimalist , surrealist .
tr	4	I looked at the painting , then back at her and signalled for her to rotate the painting 45 degrees .
tr	2	Kurt , who hailed from Blackpool , had been taken on by Mr ' A ' to strengthen his close protection squad .
tr	4	After his encounter with the wrong end of the shotgun Kurt recovered well from his injuries , only to fall foul of the hospital .
tr	3	It was then that ' Dick ' knew that he really was in the ' brown and sticky ' , and it smelt terrible .
tr	0	He was a fan of that famous American athlete and dearly wanted his new son to follow in his namesakes footsteps .
tr	3	The last time that this had happened was when Dim Daisy 's father had found them in her room trying to play strip snap .
tr	4	Before engaging brain I blurted out ' but you are only half my age , what will people say ' .
tr	1	Collecting her things she quietly stormed off , throwing the rest of her questions into my swimming pool in passing .

tr	1	We must stop and ask ourselves if we using this technology wisely or simply squandering it for profit and short-term gain ?
tr	1	I had spent my working career as an archeologist , digging up lost civilizations and searching for the causes of their demise .
tr	3	It was likely to happen abruptly so once it begun there would be nothing that could slow or arrest it .
tr	0	It was hard to contemplate yet as an archeologist I had come across it many times on a much smaller scale .
tr	4	It was no easy task to project menus and needs months in advance but eventually I worked out a list I hoped would suffice .
tr	2	I also purchased four cases of stove alcohol along with charcoal for the grill , although I planned to cook mostly with wood .
tr	3	Armament was high on the list , in truth , I would have liked to have mounted a fifty cal .
tr	0	Africa was the first and hardest hit , Somalia , Southern Sudan , and Kenya found they were cut off from international aid .
tr	1	Iran suffering under sanctions and also facing famine saw advantage in manipulating the ill will and the weakened condition of Europe .
tr	4	In an instant , Israel found herself battling for her very existence as her Muslim neighbors flung themselves upon her in mass .
tr	3	This vicious attack from all sides without hope of outside intervention placed her back to the sea with the certainty of annihilation .
tr	0	The Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf became a radioactive inferno bringing an immediate halt to all petroleum production and shipments from the region .
tr	3	The North feeling isolated , with a starving population , was left with no alternative but to join in the chaos consuming the globe .
tr	0	Here in Florida , outbreaks of Ebola in Miami and Orlando caused panic , and soon stores shelves became empty and gas stations closed .
tr	3	I won 't elaborate , just to say I had vastly underestimated job and would never attempt anything of the sort by myself again .
tr	3	It left me cut , bruised , and completely worn out , so I was more than glad to call it a day .
tr	0	Last spring 's planting had been haphazard , and those who managed to plant found no fuel available to harvest .
tr	4	Savage gangs roamed the land bent on surviving for one more day even if it meant eating their best friend .
tr	4	I was on my own ; every morning was a guessing game trying to figure out what the day 's weather held .
tr	3	My first priority was the boat ; it wasn 't going to be beat up by the surge sitting back in the creek .
tr	4	I peeked out of the hatch ; the boat was covered in small branches and leaves but was otherwise unscathed .
tr	3	I quickly turned tail and headed back to the boat , grabbed the 22 pistol and shotgun then waited in the cockpit .
tr	3	Skinny handed the other his rifle , pulled out a pistol , and with it in hand boarded the boat .
tr	3	It was going to be necessary to time it just right and pick a moment when their guard was down .
tr	0	The license read , William Combs , and gave a Clay County address from the DOB I calculated he was 36 .
tr	0	This didn 't tell me much as I didn 't know where they had come by the gas or how far they had run .
tr	4	There were three and a half boxes of shells for the deer rifles and two for the pistol but none for the assault rifle .
tr	0	There was no movement of man along the banks just an alligator and assorted waterfowl going about their daily business of earning a living .
tr	4	There was a pile of miscellaneous clothing and cooking utensils , from it I deduced this must be where the duo had their base .
tr	3	I said , " It 's alright , I 'm not going to hurt you relax , let me get those ropes off . "
tr	2	" Don 't worry Connie , I 'll get you out of this hellhole , how long have they held you ? "
tr	3	She said , " That 's the first time I 've had a chance to wash in two months . "
tr	3	She said , " My dad did too , but we ran out about three months ago that 's why I 'm here . "
tr	2	I guess the word got around as a group of armed thugs came by one day and took the rest .
tr	0	I now had almost a hundred gallons of gas and fifty-five gallons of diesel not counting what was still in the boats .
tr	1	I lit a fire in the grill , and later we sat in the cockpit and picked at the fish .
tr	3	She said , " I want you to know ; I didn 't eat them , any of them , I would starve first .
tr	2	" Connie it 's over , behind you , if you continue to look back I 'm afraid you 'll be consumed by it .
tr	3	I tied up to the houseboat ; it was evident the storm had blown it against the bank as the anchors were still attached .
tr	4	When I 'd found a suitable path over the bar , we threaded the Hunter into the Glen and anchored .
tr	3	After scratching my head trying to figure some way to get the little hooker in water , Connie came up with the solution .
tr	4	We were ready I throttled up the Sea Ray it churned sand and water sending wash against the stranded houseboat .
tr	3	The wine or the fact it was almost Christmas brought us to broach another subject , Connie brought it up .
tr	4	This cycle of dependency continued stretching the rubber band until the wars and Ebola came along , and the rubber band snapped .
tr	2	This country had been so hollowed that when push came to shove we could no longer stand on our own .
tr	2	" Now I don 't know about you honey but I 've had enough of this crap for one night .
tr	1	Connie was sitting on the front deck and at the sound rushed inside and asked , " Is that for real ? "
tr	3	He said , Mayport , was the district capital the only other groups were congregated on the west coast around Sarasota .
tr	4	I had covered a little over half the distance ; Skipper had been barking and I thought it was because he had seen me .
tr	4	I glanced up and saw Connie standing on the front deck of the houseboat with a deer rifle pointed directly at me .
tr	0	I said , " That was a fantastic shot , you nailed him honey , look ... that damn things bigger than the canoe .
tr	4	Just to be on the safe side we 'll leave him sit , after lunch , we 'll gig him . "
tr	0	Sam was a big strapping guy much closer to Connie 's age than I and had an earned reputation as a ladies ' man .
tr	1	I had run across many of these individuals in my travels and had one or two of note in my own lineage .
tr	2	Sam , was one of those people born for a purpose , yet out of sync with the times and society .
tr	4	I was glad to see Sam as if ever there was a time for a pioneer type that time was now .
tr	0	I had known a gal archeologist somewhat like her in my youth and spent a couple of years chasing her to no avail .
tr	1	I rigged up an old fashioned AM antenna on top of the boat we began picking up the Washington news .
tr	3	I had constructed a primitive irrigation system that ran off the solar panel system it would water the greenhouse and part of the garden .
tr	4	Sam provided us all with an ample supply wild meat ; we added the vegetables and between us had more than enough to eat .
tr	3	The Captain said , " That 's still a scarce item , but this makes a good excuse to put on a pot . "
tr	2	We got one guy on board who 's worked on them and were hoping to get the generators up and going .
tr	3	As for the old part I would rather stick around and watch you fall apart then even contemplate life without you .
tr	2	We 've got no idea how long or short our lives will be , so let 's just get on with living them .
tr	3	Still they had their work cutout , moving into a run-down town with no functioning electricity , water or sewer system .
tr	2	Astor had nothing to profit from , so they were basically going to remain on the dole for a while .
tr	3	Sam look at those kids out there working their asses off attempting to build a better life , that 's humankind at its best .
tr	1	That night I told Connie , " Well kid I guess this is it , I hope we 're ready for prime time . "
tr	4	Three ships were in the process of unloading , and we passed another being shepherded along with the help of two tugs .
tr	1	I said , " This is Captain George Collins I am coming at the request of Captain Allan Bright . "
tr	1	The Ensign said , " I 'm sorry sir ; Captain Bright didn 't expect you to arrive by private yacht .
tr	2	Allan got up came around the desk and said , " Come in Captain Collins , or would you prefer Doctor ? "
tr	3	What drew my interest were the papers you did on the Theory of Man thing and that tirade on The State of Affairs .
tr	4	The best that can happen is someone will ignite a new spark and hopefully it will grow into a fire . "
tr	3	I took the liberty of putting you in for a commission , damn good thing you like that title captain .
tr	1	I said , " I think Connie , and I are going to need a little time to chew on this . "
tr	0	I don 't know how in the hell Bright came across them , but I wish he hadn 't . "
tr	1	Hell honey I don 't even know if I 'm going into the Coast Guard or back in the Navy .
tr	0	I said , " I hate to appear naïve , but just what in the hell am I going to be anyway ? "
tr	4	He answered , " A captain in the United States Coast Guard by the time we walk out of here . "
tr	3	It was the first time I had the opportunity to witness her at a social event , and I was truly impressed .
tr	0	I also feel I have an obligation as a human being to do something to keep it from happening again .
tr	4	It was felt if the top brass were put in charge they would place too much emphasis on keeping their commands intact .
tr	4	It was the first day , and everyone was busy feeling out each other 's views on the subjects that were to be discussed .
tr	1	Bob had been responsible for changing my view of mankind and was in large part the inspiration for Man the Extension of Nature .
tr	3	Let us pray that we have in this room the talent , means , and wisdom to accomplish this endeavor .
tr	4	This drive to acquire knowledge created the conflicts between myth and reality we observe today as being the rift between religion and science .
tr	4	We should then be able to enjoy all she has to offer and still progress without having any deleterious effects .
tr	4	It was the first chance she had to use her degree and she was tickled at finally having the chance to practice her craft .
tr	3	I sat debating on whether to get out and wander around then thought better of it and told the driver to go on .
tr	3	I can 't send the cutters out just to explore , Christ I can 't even get them back in Key West . "
tr	2	I couldn 't help from grinning , " Allan I still believe there 's a hell for lairs but thanks anyway . "
tr	0	As the car speed away from the boat , I asked again , " Have any idea what 's going on ? "
tr	0	" Not really sir , something about a hijacking and pirates , I just know it has the whole base on alert . "
tr	4	We pulled up , I just had time to lean over and give Connie a quick kiss before I was hustled into the building .
tr	1	I 've assigned Lieutenant Bishop here as your aide , Jimmy will be with you on Mohawk good luck and happy hunting . "
tr	3	I told Jim , " Let 's take the cooks tour , start at the pointy end and work back . "
tr	4	The blasts knocked both Jim and I flat on the narrow walkway I felt little needles pricking me in the back .
tr	4	I figured the next round would either hit or straddle us , within seconds , we might all be dead .
tr	1	With everything going on I found an instant to think of Connie , it was interrupted by a tremendous explosion .
tr	0	I said , " Allan you bastard , putting me in harms way like that three days before my wedding . "
tr	4	We have absolutely no business ever wanting to leave here yet we will ; our inner nature will force us .
tr	0	I said , " Why don 't you get up a resume and I 'll forward it to Allan . "
tr	4	Allan sent notes telling of one delay after another finally a month after we got back there was something concrete .
tr	3	We stepped out of the car the crew was lined up on the wharf standing at attention with the proud little ship behind .
tr	1	I said , " Jesus , I thought this was going to be research , sounds more like search and destroy .
tr	1	I said , " Think of it more like Teddy Roosevelt , ' Speak softly and carry a big stick . '
tr	2	Got another surprise for you a small helicopter on floats to strap on the new helipad let you do a little air reconnaissance .
tr	2	Now come on George lets get back to the party so you can enjoy your first night back in civilization . "
tr	3	It hadn 't taken him long to jerk the knots out of my tail and he wound up becoming my mentor .
tr	2	Being a small ship and working in close quarters meant it would be essential we all got along personally as well as professionally .
tr	0	" OK Dan , draw up a list of exactly what you need , I 'll see what I can do .
tr	4	" OK , now it is my turn , your both experienced officers and have a lot more time at sea than I do .
tr	2	Right now , Connie and Joyce have no idea of what to do except to poke around in the labs . "
tr	1	I would like you to know beforehand that it 's not intentional on my part nor is it meant to be demeaning or patronizing .
tr	2	I said , " Round up Joyce and come upstairs , Herb 's about to put on some fireworks . "
tr	3	There 's another problem the dome won 't retract , the damned thing looks like a big toadstool sitting out there . "
tr	1	I whispered to Connie , " Let 's go work on having quiet sex if such a thing is possible . "
tr	3	I want to paint a picture so in five hundred or a thousand years there is no conjecture about what went on .
tr	4	Take your time , and we 'll all sit down and hash out the fine points when you 're ready . "
tr	4	I got Herb and Dan together told them to make sure everything was removed and that no damage was done to the gun .
tr	1	Up until now things had been running along with just a hitch or two , nothing out of the ordinary .
tr	1	I have just made provisioning the number one priority , you will be working with Ensign Sanchez she is junior logistics officer .
tr	0	Allan said , " Say your guys didn 't come across a stray refrigerated truckload of meat by any chance did they ? "
tr	4	I sat munching on the hamburger wondering if just maybe I did have a Holden in my crew after all .
tr	4	Herb grinned , " If I should happen to come across anything I 'll make every effort to recover the Captains steaks . "
tr	2	I said , " There 's only one rating on board who 's worked for NOAA and knows anything about operating the trawl .
tr	4	He teamed up with the guys who dreamed up the funky gun cover and together they designed and built the pad .
tr	0	I walked on board called Jim over and said , " Jim round up everyone and make ready to get underway ASAP . "
tr	4	I popped in , checked on the bridge then Connie and I walked out , and stood leaning on the bridge rail .
tr	3	I never told you , but before this started I was on my way to taking little Surreal and cruising the Caribbean .
tr	2	Occasionally a small fire or twinkling light gave proof that there were still a few people tenaciously clinging to life .
tr	2	" Hello Abe , everything 's going pretty well so far , knock on wood ... how about you , feeling OK ? "
tr	4	The meeting would be held aboard Pisces that way we could avoid putting people ashore until we were sure the situation was safe .
tr	0	Small boats began to gather around , they were smiling and waving , among them was a friendly young man wearing a uniform .
tr	4	I had Linda ask him who was in charge and to tell them we would like to arrange a meeting here on the ship .
tr	2	" We made a conscious decision to play God and to select who would live and those who would die .
tr	0	Man 's law , nature 's law they had been in conflict and in the end it was nature 's that prevailed .
tr	0	He warned to be careful as a flood of refugees had inundated Cuba and it had started a bitter war .
tr	1	We widened the search but after an hour had found no signs of current human activity , not even a wandering dog .
tr	4	We returned to the ship and stowed the chopper , Later I downloaded the pictures so everyone on board could see the devastation .
tr	4	Gerald can give me a tour over Cap Haitian then we 'll head on down the line to the Puerto Rico .
tr	2	That afternoon the lookout reported a small boat was approaching the ship and reported there were only two people on board .
tr	0	I asked if she would act as translator , Connie also knew a little French and came along to listen in .
tr	1	Connie and I were sitting in the sand , a plate between us picking on a rack of ribs when a gunshot rang out .
tr	4	I grabbed the glasses and could see several others in the distance , they had hold of Carol Abernathy and were dragging her away .
tr	3	I told everyone to get back to the ship , it would take two trips to ferry everyone , the scientists first .
tr	0	I can 't send a search party out after dark poking around not knowing anything about the area and who were dealing with .
tr	3	I said , " OK we know what they want ; How do they plan on going about getting it ?
tr	0	I said , " I 've known Sam for a long time he 's a hunter at heart and he 's damn sure game .
tr	2	It took him about an hour to cover the distance and locate the group who were camped out in an old villa .
tr	4	When he found her , she was almost naked hands tied behind her back and ankles hobbled so she couldn 't run .
tr	4	Connie was standing next to me she asked , " GW why did you do that to those people . "
tr	0	It had regressed to the days when all a physician could do was to hold a hand and comfort the patient .
tr	1	I said , " Your thanks should go to Dennis , Sam and Ned they risked their lives for you .
tr	1	As it is , your back with us in one piece and Cindy will get off with no more than a reprimand .
tr	2	Jim shouted , " Ensign Jackson permission for you only to come on board , please be ready to surrender your side arm . "
tr	1	Sorry about the formalities but we 're under strict orders not to allow anyone to bring a firearm on board .
tr	1	He said , " Captain Collins I run a tight ship , San Juan I believe is the safest harbor in the Caribbean .
tr	1	I turned him over to Cindy and Linda and let them fill him in and bring him up to speed .
tr	3	We spent the night at anchor , I still felt the necessity to post double guards and lookouts , but the night was uneventful .
tr	3	There 's a tanker on the way , but I don 't want to start counting chickens before they hatch .
tr	2	If we were going to stay around for two weeks , I was going to do some exploring of my own .
tr	0	He said there was a committee of sorts that was handling civic affairs and was run by a man named Fernando Vella .
tr	1	It 's possible in his zeal to do his job he might not be aware someone is manipulating him for their own purposes .
tr	4	Every fiber in my being was urging me to lean over and say to Connie its time to go home dear .
tr	2	The US is on its way to recovery and coming along , but we still have a ways to go . "
tr	2	" Mr. Vella I can well understand your position as Puerto Rico was left on its own to fend for itself .
tr	1	I assembled Jim , Herb , Dan , and Dennis as well for I had come to value his opinions on military matters .
tr	4	" It 's not going to be easy , I 'm sure were being watched and no one except Linda speaks fluent Spanish .
tr	3	Anyway that 's the score up to now let 's make up our minds and get on with it one way or another . "
tr	2	Killing used to be my profession you guys come up with a mission , I 'll do my best to carry it out . "
tr	3	" Captain I found out what you wanted to know about Jeff , I had to sleep with him to make sure . "
tr	1	" I know you been wondering where I fit into all this , I figured that out when you sent Linda snooping around .
tr	1	Jeff said , " Not here sir you won 't , Roosevelt Roads that 's where he stashes all his stuff . "
tr	0	Dennis and Jeff had planned all day , they had to be careful as Vella had spies watching all the activity around the station .
tr	3	I needed to totally disarm him and gain his trust , what better way than to appeal to his grandiose nature .
tr	4	I understand there 's an armature radio operator in town would it be possible for him to send a message ? "
tr	0	Capt. A. Bright , Mayport , As per ships arrival request permission to rendezvous at sea and provide escort into San Juan .
tr	0	Vella was excited and licked his lips nervously , I thought OK , now I got you bastard and gave the signal .
tr	4	I hadn 't been asleep but in a stupor dreaming of Connie and had almost expected to see her when I opened my eyes .
tr	1	I said , " No Jim you and Herb run things for a while , what 's the situation ? "
tr	3	The launch slowed to a stop we were a sitting duck all they had to do was to walk in on us .
tr	2	We pulled up to the doctor 's house he met us at the door , took the blood , and began the transfusion .
tr	3	Don 't beat yourself up over this , nowhere is it written that it 's a crime to be human . "
tr	3	The GPS system had come on line but was intermittent and unreliable so it still remained the rule to take sights at every opportunity .
tr	4	As far as I was concerned the statute of limitations had run out and the evidence had for the most part been consumed .
tr	2	It was good to be free from the burdens of command and among friends with whom we had shared so much .
tr	1	I immediately shut the engine down , as Dan would eat my ass if I ran it until it came unglued .
tr	3	Gerald was sure to find us with the helicopter in the morning until then we would have to sit it out .
tr	0	What say you and I make a trek tonight and look around then we 'll have some idea of what 's going on ?
tr	4	We agreed to return tomorrow night with the battery and diesel from the launch , sneak aboard get the ketch running and haul ass .
tr	2	" I wish I could lay out some kind of decent option for you and Joyce but frankly there aren 't any .
tr	0	Honey if we aren 't back by daylight pack up as much food and water as you can carry and start walking north .
tr	3	Travel at night its cooler ; try to get as far North as possible , there 's a good chance Pisces will find you .
tr	3	" GW I don 't want to sound like a wuss but I really think it 's time we went home . "
tr	1	Someone had gone to the trouble of fitting the engine with an auxiliary panel , and it now came in handy .
tr	4	It soon became evident this had been a private vacation island of the rich and infamous , most likely some drug cartel .
tr	3	Great but we still had to know if it was from one of the good cisterns so Sam went to investigate .
tr	3	" Look what I 've found , I bet it runs all the way out to the end of the dock . "
tr	2	Connie said , " We threw out a good bit of stuff some of the cans were rusted through or bulging . "
tr	4	We searched for the key off and on for two days ; it was Joyce who found it in the caretaker 's kitchen drawer .
tr	2	I flipped on the light and in front of us was something far more valuable than drugs or money , food .
tr	0	I found a dual action air sander and removed the name on the transom board then put on fresh coats of varnish .
tr	3	Finally , we shut down the generator , which had in large part contributed to making this truly our little , Fantasy Island .
tr	0	We watched our Fantasy Island grow smaller until it vanished from sight , just a small cloud marking its location .
tr	1	With the current and wind both working in our favor calculations put us in Belize after a leisurely four or five days of cruising .
tr	3	All traffic was either by foot , mule cart or bicycle even without cars and trucks the streets seemed to bustle with activity .
tr	4	Belize had never stopped using its currency so Claude had lent us fifty bucks in exchange for a promise of some of our booze .
tr	3	" Rumor has it someone torched the Venezuelan Navy you didn 't have anything to do with that did you ? "
tr	4	We , on the other hand , had been conserving our battery waiting for a light so we could respond .
tr	0	I said , " Not so fast Jim we 've been passing command of this damn thing back and forth like a hot potato .
tr	2	I was hoping Allan would concede and let Jim take over Pisces for I couldn 't bring myself to abandon Homeward Bound .
tr	2	Get settled in we 'll go over everything tomorrow I have something for you which should be right down your ally .
tr	4	At the little reception , that evening Abe Gully and Chad were hungry for details , especially about Puerto Rico and Venezuela .
tr	2	" George , I want you to become a roving ambassador and follow up on the contacts you made in the last few months .
tr	0	Sam should be an asset ; anyone , who can defeat a whole navy single-handed , is always good to have around .
tr	1	" Allan 's right , you 've changed history and I can 't see you quitting without finishing the job .
tr	4	China , the sleeping giant , soon took notice , awakened , and quickly raced to the head of the pack .
tr	0	Financial markets became increasingly convoluted as a once great economy attempted to maintain its world position solely by manipulating paper .
tr	1	This marked the beginning of the end for both the small family farm and hometown banking as we had known it .
tr	0	Many of the banks in our area began to look toward commercial real estate investment instead of making personal or farm loans .
tr	2	I now view the selling of stock in a company as something akin to selling off little pieces of your soul .
tr	0	They make their living watching , alert to any weakness , and ready to swoop down on some fat hapless company .
tr	3	As with all isms , it has its limitations and must be managed to some degree least it get out of hand .
tr	4	They completely lack the wisdom , vision , moral fortitude , flexibility , and especially the common sense necessary to solve complex problems .
tr	3	It 's disgusting , a blatant betrayal of the public trust , and in every sense of the word just dog gone wrong .
tr	2	Without really being aware , major news organizations through their own volition have evolved into nothing more than propaganda machines .
tr	2	People associate propaganda with the likes of Goebbels , Stalin , or Tokyo Rose as the telling of gross untruths , not so !
tr	4	It appears to have created little difficulty between Canada and the US as we operate on a more or less level playing field .
tr	1	It will become another industry of jobs Americans don 't want as they can no longer afford to work in the trucking industry .
tr	3	It 's your property , you pay the mortgage , and taxes , you maintain , improve , and protect it .
tr	3	There should be no amnesty offered it is an affront to those patiently waiting around the world to legally immigrate to this country .
tr	1	Deport any individual who is discovered residing in this country illegally using whatever means it takes if that includes so-called profiling so be it .
tr	1	Human beings rely on profiling , it is a basic innate survival strategy employed even by infants and is enhanced by life long learning .
tr	1	We have squandered our blood and treasure for zero gain in our attempts at selling our brand of democracy around the world .
tr	0	I have watched two of my favorite corporations International Harvester and General Motors go from being giants to virtually disappearing .
tr	4	The companies will tell you that it was the intransigence of their workforce that led them to lose competitiveness in their respective markets .
tr	4	As the Japanese steadily advanced , we , who were still loyal , waited patently for G.M. to come to its senses .
tr	1	Any entity , which is allowed to do so , will stifle all competition and innovation which is counter productive in a capitalist system .
tr	2	We have to find some solution to our innate proclivity to procreate and to limit world population to a level of sustainability .
tr	2	They began to consolidate power closing small community schools and busing kids miles away from home to become just one among thousands .
tr	0	Schools can again become an integral part of a child 's life and a positive force , which helps to bind a community together .
tr	3	There is a group at the top that sees nothing wrong with turning America once again into a peasant society .
tr	4	Liberals and Conservatives alike are quick to wield it like a weapon accusing one group or another of being intolerant .
tr	2	It makes no difference whether its wood , coal , oil , thermal , wind , hydro , solar or what have you .
tr	1	It is not only demeaning to us as a nation but may in the end prove to be our undoing .
tr	1	This will go hand in hand with the increase in new technicians both of which can be mass-produce without sacrificing quality .
tr	3	Pharmaceutical companies need to concentrate on getting things right instead of paying doctors to push pills just to maximize profit .
tr	3	The modern pharmaceutical industry cares not whether it does good or harm just so that its makes a huge profit .
tr	1	I see nothing wrong in doing this as it is every nation 's duty to guard the well being of its citizens .
tr	4	It directly addresses the important question of who we are as a species , and our presence and purpose on Earth .
tr	4	It is a prime directive of nature , but one she has been unable to fulfill until the evolution of man .
tr	4	We have begun to ascertain for ourselves as well as for her what lies in our solar system and beyond .
tr	1	If life is to survive and thrive in such hostile enviroments , it will be necessary for it to adapt .
tr	4	Primitive senses evolved organisms still had no concept of intelligence yet within them there developed the seed of the thing we call Nature .
tr	4	If only she could take one of her life forms and gradually force and coax it into becoming capable of thwarting the next threat .
tr	3	Even at full throttle , there might not be time to avert the next big event but it was worth a try .
tr	4	Nature even went so far as to deprive this miserable creature of a luxurious fur coat to provide him protection from the elements .
tr	1	This species still had no idea of why it was here , only realizing that in many ways it was becoming unique .
tr	4	This transition , as it takes place , may well be responsible for the turmoil we find ourselves experiencing today .
tr	4	Nature unleashed and no longer bound by the constraints imposed by ordinary evolution is free to explore multitudes of new avenues .
tr	0	When we are finally successful think of what a coup it will be not just for humans , but for Nature as a whole .
tr	2	He lay back on his mat looking up into the gloom of the rafters through the faint haze of smoke from the morning fire .
tr	3	His final thought being , " we 're short of meat and I won 't be hunting today , " then the darkness .
tr	3	Jennings stood up , stretching his back , thinking about breakfast and a shower , not that the water ever got cold .
tr	2	Probably won 't get to talk to them for another week or so when they slog out so no help there .
tr	3	" Thank you Captain but you might prefer to call me Gema it 's so much less of a mouthful . "
tr	2	If you do go in you could take them along ... ... sort of give ' em a test drive so to speak .
tr	3	" There 's something she 's not telling me , " thought Mason , " but now is not the time .
tr	3	It 's obvious they 're using it to incite the Muslims and get them onside plus as a tool to spread propaganda . "
tr	3	He was down in that area a few months ago , tells me it 's not exactly his favorite part of the country . "
tr	2	asked Mason , " we 've been looking all over for you and your team , couldn 't find a bloody soul . "
tr	4	For jungle warfare they might be really good but we don 't know yet what sort of foliage deflection we might get .
tr	4	We 'll use the one we use for reconnaissance , it 's got the extra fuel tanks , they 'll probably need 'em .
tr	1	If it 's not hot we could rope in , damn sight easier than slogging in from a few miles out .
tr	2	" Sounds good to me sir , if it 's OK with you I 'll take the normal fire team ... .
tr	3	Nothing exists on earth other than this girl , with the wide open eyes , standing in front of him .
tr	3	Mason smiled , it was still hard for him to accept the total lack of customary military discipline with the troopers .
tr	0	The group laughed at Mason 's casual approach , understanding that he was making light of putting them in harm 's way .
tr	1	Three hundred rounds a man plus an extra two hundred for Robbie and I , grub and water for two weeks .
tr	1	She was dressed in her usual long black skirt , white blouse and sandals and invited him into her sparsely furnished flat .
tr	3	" Deal with that when we get to it , " he thought , " there 's no other way . "
tr	3	He spent the rest of the morning going over the duty watch reports of the previous night 's radio traffic .
tr	1	The green light flashed on and the four of them , in unison , jumped into the beginning dawn light .
tr	4	the river , now discernible winding away to the south , the light green of the cultivated padi visible in the bend .
tr	4	Robbie with the Bren and Mudd with the FLN immediately take up defensive positions eyes sweeping the compound in front of them .
tr	1	Not a sound save for the snuffling of the feeding boar in the underbrush and the normal jungle sounds in the canopy above .
tr	4	They buried the two bodies in a shallow communal grave , gathering rocks to create a small marker and committed them to their maker .
tr	3	It had stopped raining and the sun was trying to break through the clouds even though it was late in the day .
tr	3	He hated it but it was something to do and he had ample opportunity to play golf when it took his fancy .
tr	3	He , in turn , had threatened to resign his commission if that was what it was going to take .
tr	4	" I thought we 'd already agreed , " she said , " I 'm going to start dinner . "
tr	0	Gema was adamant though and , off and on , they 'd been chewing over it for over a month ... . .
tr	3	From time to time she thought perhaps she was using Wendy but she 'd get plenty out of it too .
tr	4	" Where we are going , in a couple of days , is one of the last truly uncivilized places on earth .
tr	2	Tomorrow we go shopping for you , jungle khakis , boots , headgear , a couple of changes plus a first aid kit .
tr	0	You 're going to need bug cream , a knife and a parang plus water bottles and backpacks for both of us .
tr	0	He was a small wiry man in shorts and tee shirt , parang tucked into a colorful sash around his waist .
tr	4	" Try and get some sleep Wendy , " said her mother , " tomorrow we start the hard part . "
tr	1	I didn 't see a visitor , a stranger , until I was fifteen years old ... ... a missionary . "
tr	2	She was obviously looking for something although what it could be , after so many years , Wendy had no idea .
tr	4	It was a large clearing in front of the house that was used for festivals and quite often where the children played .
tr	0	His drive had leaked a bit to the right and he was mulling over which iron to use on his approach shot .
tr	2	unusual for you to be home this time of year , usually you 're off gallivanting in some far off place . "
tr	4	He 'd lost friends during his career and he 'd mourned them but death was a shadow that hung over them all .
tr	2	Not so long ago he had been approached by Shell Oil to provide security for their oil rigs in Brunei .
tr	3	The nice thing about this club was that it was within walking distance of his store on the Kensington High Street .
tr	1	He 'd recently expanded his business onto the continent and now had a regular truck running from London to Amsterdam .
tr	1	He 'd also indulged himself recently and spent a stunning amount of money to join a golf club down in Richmond .
tr	2	" Bout a month from now , not much notice for the chaps that have to come a long way .
tr	4	" Actually I 'm from Viet Nam originally but I 've been here so long I feel as though I was born here . "
tr	1	" I 'll come with you , " said Harry , " don 't like using the bushes with guests in tow .
tr	0	" What a dump , " he thought , " hope I don 't have to wait much longer . "
tr	3	He was starting to feel conspicuous , sitting on his own , in a pub getting more raucous by the minute .
tr	1	Suddenly , standing in front of him , out of nowhere a nondescript oriental bloke in leather jacket and jeans .
tr	3	" For these tickets to the match tomorrow afternoon , " he pushed a pair of tickets across the grimy table .
tr	2	" Soccer match tomorrow , round of golf at Moor Allerton on Sunday then pick up my car and head home on Monday . "
tr	4	She rummaged through the top drawer ... nothing but the usual stuff , pens , pencils , paper clips , his diary .
tr	2	A dozen photographs fell out onto the desk , the first a photo of a headless man lying in a pool of blood .
tr	4	Her Silat training allowed her to control herself and all the tangled up emotions that would overcome her ... ... .
tr	3	She knew that the true trial was about to begin , tonight of all nights ... ... a Regimental Reunion ... ... . .
tr	3	The following Wednesday he made his way to the Victoria Line and took the Tube to Brixton , the last stop on the line .
tr	3	Stay out of his way , he 'll get impatient particularly if the crowd starts to boo , then he 's toast . "
tr	3	The smartly dressed man , sitting in the crowd , on the dirty bench applauded and shouted with the rest of them .
tr	0	" I can , " said Avi , " but there 's a couple of reasons I don 't want to .
tr	4	" After you 've sent me the list you wait one week and then call the number I just gave you .
tr	1	They had taps on his home in St John 's Wood , the shop in Kensington and the warehouse in Brixton .
tr	4	" Not quite sure yet , " he replied , " I 'll probably know better in a week or so .
tr	1	" Let 's go in my office Dave ... ... grab a coffee ... if you can stand the stuff . "
tr	2	" Hey I 'm on your side in this , " said the Commander , " I 've known you too long .
tr	3	" Most of them are still around , if not active at least still close to what 's going on .
tr	3	He was sitting in the snug in The Green Dragon on Broad St. just down the street from the Cathedral .
tr	4	A pert thirty year old complete with freckles , turned up nose and auburn hair cut in a page boy .
tr	2	" I was down to London for a couple of days , " he said ordering another pint for himself .
tr	2	The following morning he got to the office balancing a couple of Starbucks , one for him and one for Jennie ... . .
tr	3	" Give us a chance to get a good look around then without them getting their knickers in a twist , " said David .
tr	2	" He 's in a bunker , on the fifth , close to the pond , four women in the group that found him .
tr	0	" That 'll make the grounds staff happy , " said David " a truck in the middle of the fairway . "
tr	1	" Well it 's a start , " said David , " let 's try and shake up Forensic Services on the prints . "
tr	4	Here in Hereford we 're surrounded by military bases so it seemed like a good place to put me out to grass .
tr	4	" Obviously there 's something going down although we 've no idea what it might be , " said Jennie .
tr	3	He really regretted having to retire but he knew he was getting a little old for that sort of thing .
tr	4	She had an appointment to see George Mudd at the old manor house and he 'd given her easy instructions for getting there .
tr	3	" This place cost a bob or two , " she thought getting out of the car in the gravel forecourt .
tr	0	Approximately six feet , tanned and extremely fit , didn 't look as though he had any fat on him at all .
tr	0	As I 'm certain you already know we were part of ' C ' Squadron 22 SAS stationed in Kuching .
tr	2	Harry Downer dead and these two ex clerks obviously up to no good , somehow Tony Wei mixed up in the whole bloody thing .
tr	2	" I 'd appreciate knowing the cause of death as soon as you know , would you give me a ring ? "
tr	3	Told me there 's ongoing petty theft out of the quartermaster 's stores but they can 't pin it on anyone specific .
tr	2	" Sorry this took so long , " a young sounding voice over the phone , " had us baffled for quite a while .
tr	2	OK , now this part is going to blow you away if you 'll excuse the pun ... ... . .
tr	4	" Okay , " said David , " we might as well release it but we 're both going to the funeral .
tr	4	She didn 't seem to call home that often ... ... in fact she only seemed to call when Gema was home .
tr	4	Gema just hadn 't been the same since the reunion , not that things had really been any good before .
tr	2	I 'm not suggesting we split up , I am suggesting some changes ... ... providing you agree ... . .
tr	3	who 's calling me at this stupid hour it 's my day off , " she said to the empty room .
tr	3	" That 's the trouble with the systems in this country , " said Jennie , " there 's no central information data base .
tr	4	Jennie noted that his manner seemed a lot lighter now as though getting some information had allowed him to make a decision .
tr	2	He stopped at a solid looking door and keyed a code into an electronic pad to one side of the door .
tr	1	" You could take someone 's head off with this thing quite easily , " said David thoughtfully , looking at Jennie .
tr	1	He 's either a cold fish , which I doubt somehow , or it 's just bottled up inside him . "
tr	1	He was sufficiently concerned to tell Dick that he was going to call Robbie in Brunei and fill him in .
tr	1	He still wasn 't used to having her around but it saved having to do his own cooking and bringing in a cleaner .
tr	2	" Tomorrow if that 's not inconvenient , " replied the Commander , " I 'll call you from the hotel . "
tr	3	The following day the Commander and David agreed to meet at the Bath Street Police Station rather than the Dragon .
tr	0	They gave me a hell of an argument , " he said laughing , " but I think it was all a front .
tr	3	" Could well be the case , " replied David , " but I think it goes a lot further than that .
tr	2	It would be a shame to cut her out of the picture , she 's a good copper with a lot of local knowledge .
tr	3	He 's got it all bottled up inside of him , he might think he has little to lose . "
tr	4	" OK see you then , " he said sounding happy , " and don 't wear those red shoes ! "
tr	0	If the shit hits the fan later we can always plead ignorance and fall back onto our ' consultant ' understanding .
tr	2	Normally it took about an hour and a half from door to door but today he was in no hurry .
tr	2	" I didn 't tell you but I 'm on the board here so I kind of know what goes on .
tr	4	Dave was going to bring you up to speed but I kidnapped you down here before he had the chance .
tr	4	after all that I still can 't believe Harry and Peter are gone , " he whispered his voice and face hardening .
tr	4	George promptly called David and brought him up to speed who in turn alerted the teams on the other three .
tr	3	He was picked up at the bus station by a known Provo and they met two others in Victoria Square .
tr	0	They have a daughter up at Cambridge you know and Gema herself has a terrific job with a Translation Company .
tr	2	" I need to talk to Robbie anyway , why don 't you come over to the house tomorrow ? "
tr	4	The East Window , installed in 1320 and removed during the war for safekeeping , gravestones so old you could barely read the inscriptions .
tr	0	" I hear what you 're saying , " said Jennie , " but who 's to say it 's not a woman ? "
tr	4	Nice looking place , obviously an old farmhouse with the barn behind her on the other side of the cobbled yard .
tr	4	George , lying stretched out on the couch , stroking the back of her neck affectionately answered , " not absolutely sure yet .
tr	2	I know Dickie is coming and probably Wendy if she comes down from Cambridge but Dick wasn 't sure about Gema for some reason .
tr	4	They were all staying in different hotels and bed and breakfasts , all within walking distance of the center of town .
tr	0	He was far enough away from the main road as to be almost invisible providing a police car didn 't patrol through here .
tr	3	It took better than forty minutes to throw up road blocks on all the major arteries in and around the base and Market Drayton .
tr	1	" If I was planning a strike like that I would do it with six to eight people ... ... no more .
tr	3	The three of them got into the car parked at the curb , the driver pulled out into the traffic .
tr	4	" Sit down John , " said the cultured one nodding his head towards one of the pine chairs at the table .
tr	3	" Okay John the moment of truth , firstly the names of the men with you at Tern Hill . "
tr	1	He had been complacent , he knew it and now the knot in his stomach was becoming a constant reminder .
tr	2	Having come to a conclusion his stomach settled down and he could focus more on the details of the jobs at hand .
tr	1	He just got bored silly going round and round and much preferred jogging down by the river and the canal .
tr	3	* Tony took a table in the dining room sitting with his back to the wall facing the entrance ... ... .
tr	2	Frank told him that his order was ready and that he would be willing to deliver it the following Monday Dec 23rd .
tr	3	Each of the four sat , quietly lost in their own thoughts , considering their potential part in what the Commander was proposing .
tr	3	" Well ... that 's the most activity we 've had in the last ten days , " said George .
tr	1	" Darn right , " replied George , " no point in running backwards and forwards all week is there ? "
tr	3	I don 't want to be treated as Lady of the Manor and I want to be involved in the household stuff ... ... .
tr	2	" You know this is too bloody complicated , " said the Commander , " too much going on at once .
tr	4	The Command and Control center was , in fact , a completely nondescript fifty three foot trailer parked several blocks from the warehouse .
tr	1	The SAS Captain , sitting in a swivel chair in front of a console of screens and phones , turned to him .
tr	0	The police , in Yorkshire and Ireland , are all in place and are just waiting for the go ahead from us . "
tr	2	There 'll be two on the back door , two on the main entrance in the front and two on the dock doors .
tr	0	The Met is prepared to handle road blocks if necessary and will block all traffic as soon as we go in .
tr	4	Jennings got out of the van , looked up and down the street and rang the bell by the side of the dock door .
tr	3	All the same ... ... looks like two calibers ... ... about 5000 rounds in total I 'd estimate . "
tr	0	It was as quiet and as unobtrusive as we could have it and no one got hurt ... ... ... ... . .
tr	4	All the Irish have been picked up , are in transit to London and are awaiting Her Majesty 's pleasure .
tr	1	By the way we found twenty thousand quid in small bills in a briefcase in Wei 's office ... ... . .
tr	1	David and Jennie are coming up to London next Friday to interview Tony Wei ... ... ... ... anybody anything to add ? "
tr	1	It was obvious that now the dogs were playing rather than working , chasing each other and rolling in the snow .
tr	2	Jennie had moved over to the stereo and now the soaring sounds of the Guildford Choir filled the room with a traditional carol .
tr	2	I know you haven 't known each other for too long but it 's obvious to everyone that you belong together .
tr	3	I think what I 'm trying to say is that they would do anything for him ... ... ... . .
tr	2	Just a word to the wise ... ... ... ... ... ... " George came back into the room ... ... dogs in tow .
tr	1	" I 'll be wearing it tomorrow , " said Robbie " full dress tomorrow ... ... it 's Christmas Day . "
tr	1	" It 'll go wonderfully with my gift to you , " he said passing her a long box wrapped in Christmas paper .
tr	3	There 's a bit of a jurisdictional fight going on , the fact that it 's Christmas Eve doesn 't exactly help either .
tr	0	" I agree , " said George , " anyway it 's Christmas Day and we should just enjoy it .
tr	2	I 'm going to take the dogs out for a pee Robbie why don 't you come with me . "
tr	3	They walked out into the paddock , the bright moonlight lighting the way , the dogs tearing around , glad to be out .
tr	3	I 'm not comfortable with this at all ... ... ... put it down to my intuition , " said George .
tr	4	She showered and dressed in a tweed skirt complemented by an emerald green silk blouse that accented her auburn hair and green eyes .
tr	3	" Why don 't we go into the study and crack a nice bottle of sherry whilst we wait for them ? "
tr	4	I don 't think one word passed between Dickie and Gema all day or with Wendy for that matter ... ... . .
tr	3	She also works out with her mother and apparently goes to the same dojo ... ... ... doing that Indonesian martial arts thing . "
tr	2	Four will be doing a guard duty on the estate and I want you personally to babysit someone for me .
tr	3	I don 't want her out of your sight but I don 't want her to know you 're even there .
tr	3	" I 'm with you on that Robbie ... ... they wouldn 't expect anything less and neither would I ... ... .
tr	0	Reaching in he took out two handguns , his SIG 9 mill and the Browning High Power which he passed to Robbie .
tr	1	no sign of anyone having passed since the snowfall , the gravestones standing like dark , lonely sentinels against the bright snow .
tr	3	Due to Pauline being in the car it was impossible for them to enter into anything other than small talk .
tr	0	" Sergeant Mudd to you Wei , " said George walking over to a chair against the wall and sitting down .
tr	3	" Well don 't get used to the idea , " said David , " it won 't last too long .
tr	4	Tony sat there seemingly unperturbed understanding immediately that he must have been under surveillance for a considerable period of time .
tr	2	" Of course I admit to playing golf on both courses but I had nothing to do with your killings .
tr	0	Why would I deny it anyway ... ... ... you say you have enough to lock me up for several lifetimes anyway ? "
tr	2	" It 's not our intention to lock you up , " said David , " that would be too easy .
tr	2	With that he stood up , opened the door and walked out into the lobby closing the door behind him .
tr	4	" Go ahead and bring someone else in , " said George , " makes sense when she 's in Hereford and not here .
tr	3	" What is really strange is that they are similar to the tattoos on Gema and Wendy ... ... ... ... ... . .
tr	3	" That 's a great idea but I would prefer if you don 't mention anything about either Gema or Wendy to him .
tr	3	that and a reduction in libido although he hadn 't had the opportunity to put that to the test for quite some time .
tr	4	" Look for a note and dust the whole place , it 's a crime scene until I say different .
tr	0	I have him in the house but he 's a bit hypothermic , he 's going to be OK though .
tr	1	" Stop right where you are , " a soft Irish brogue from the dark , a flashlight right in his face blinding him .
tr	2	" Sergeant Major ... ... didn 't know if it was you or not , can 't be too careful .
tr	4	The dogs nearly knocked him over when he opened the door , Robbie was waiting for him in the study .
tr	1	" I 've no fucking idea , " said George , " what I do know is that it 's getting out of hand .
tr	0	" Conference call , " said David walking into the office , " Commander wants to talk to us ... ... .
tr	3	" That 's a turn up for the book , " said David , " what 's with the one way ticket ?
tr	1	" First thing you can do is invite me in , " said Jennie , " it 's damned cold out here . "
tr	4	Concerning the death of your husband nothing has , as of now , been concluded therefore this entire property is a crime scene .
tr	3	Either you let me in right now or I will come back with a warrant that will allow us to search the entire property .
tr	4	she 's a grown woman and has her own life , she certainly doesn 't check in with me all the time . "
tr	2	" Seriously though I ' m actually a consultant or observer as I ' m sure someone is going to explain .
tr	2	" George I 've known you for over twenty years do you really think I have anything to do with this ?
tr	2	I have to advise you not to touch or remove anything until you are advised that it is clear to do so .
tr	1	Downer was into it a little and took some basic training whilst he was in Sarawak back in the sixties .
tr	1	It 's derived from the hunting styles of animals in the jungle and is common in families that have inherited cultural traditions .
tr	4	It 's not limited to physical offense and defense but really focuses on the spiritual which makes practitioners even more dangerous .
tr	4	" We can 't ignore the fact that four people are dead therefore we have to assume a defensive posture for the time being .
tr	4	David was going to speak to the Commander to both bring him up to speed and suggest some technical surveillance on Gema Mason .
tr	3	He found it tucked in with all his notes , the print of the photo he had taken of Tony Wei 's hands .
tr	1	He was in no hurry and the rain had set in again , if it turned much colder it would snow .
tr	4	Passing through it he came to an open plan , super modern kitchen and breakfast room with large shuttered windows doubtless overlooking the courtyard .
tr	1	" I know you did Jen but this is bloody amazing , I had no idea it was like this . "
tr	1	" I had no idea it was like this , it 's like her own personal dojo , it 's almost creepy .
tr	2	He took the photo of Tony Wei 's hands out of his inside pocket and held it out to her .
tr	4	She focused on her centre and did not allow her feelings or thoughts to manifest themselves physically in any way .
tr	3	" It 's hard to say , " she whispered , " the tattoos are faded and the photo is quite small .
tr	3	The hotel , she found out , was the oldest in Wales and actually built into the walls of the ancient castle .
tr	4	Based on the photos a reconnaissance team from the 22 SAS was inserted to investigate on the ground , I commanded that team .
tr	3	David I want you to elicit her help with identifying the tattoos so get her into see Wei in Barnet .
tr	1	" She either made you or just assumed she was being followed , " said George , " I always said she was smart .
tr	3	If the authorities wanted to trace her by the time they got the information it would be too late anyway .
tr	1	He put his hand in his pocket and handed her his car keys and then knelt down in front of her .
tr	3	They 'll do all the usual things ... put watchers on the airports , bus terminals , ports , train stations etc. .
tr	1	" Shut up , don 't say another word , " she spat at him in Malay to his surprise .
tr	3	" That 's a lot better , " she said , " I hate the thought of having to clean up .
tr	0	" Place looks nice and quiet and pastoral , " said David settling in the drawing room with a cuppa brought in by Marjorie .
tr	3	" Twenty years later it is done , " she thought , " my honor and the honor of my family is reinstated .
tr	0	He was dressed completely in black with a black balaclava hiding his features , black combat boots on his feet ... black gloves .
tr	0	It felt as though a jack hammer hit him in the chest as a boot hit him below the heart .
tr	4	She took a deep breath and a smile of anticipation covered her face as she wound up for the killing blow .
tr	2	If you would like to share this book with another person , please purchase an additional copy for each person you share it with .
tr	2	Dedication To all the authors who inspired me over the years of reading allowing me a moment of joy exploring their Worlds of imagination .
tr	3	I also want to thank my husband putting up with me and literally did all the house hold chores so that I could write .
tr	3	Led by a tall blond man , the two women of the group were attracting a few lustful looks of unwanted characters .
tr	2	The blond giant closed the door behind them , tapping on the roof to signal the coach driver to move .
tr	0	Two years ago they had embarked on a voyage from India to Portugal , a supposedly easy and hassle-free voyage .
tr	1	I had to stop myself from shivering in front of this obnoxious man , and will keep my distance the entire trip .
tr	0	The Captain told me it was quite a large number but bragged his vessel was capable of carrying the load .
tr	2	I can only hope that we will be well and that the Lord 's protection will be with us daily .
tr	3	I could see that it hurt her but I had to explain to her that he has to do his work .
tr	4	It was by pure accident since I keep my distance , but when I touched her I could not let her go .
tr	3	Don 't let him turn out to be just another man who wants to bed me , only to run off again .
tr	4	She merely walked up to me and started to introduce herself to me while she placed her hand on my arm .
tr	0	The Captain and Faro sneered down at him while they talked about me , as if I am a common whore .
tr	3	It was a peace that settled deep within me and I know that this is the man I have lost my heart to .
tr	3	I wanted to stay but Alfonso convinced me it would not be wise for the captain to find me there .
tr	4	She had read them so often that she knew them by heart , but still they evoked in her a sense of belonging .
tr	0	Captain Jean le Blanc was around her father 's age with dark blue eyes and black hair , grey visible all around his head .
tr	3	She tried to convince him to talk to her , to find out more detail but he was silent all the way .
tr	4	It was he who wounded me before I got off the ship , to make sure I would deliver the message . "
tr	4	His eyes shifted to her with amusement and with a mockingly courteous nod to her , he turned and left .
tr	3	When the crew started to drink all the whiskey in an attempt to soften the blow of death , he kept calm .
tr	0	Wrapping his arms around his wife , he caressed her back and in return , tiny hands held his broad back , caressing him .
tr	4	She stood there until the white sails were set high above her , the breeze filling them with snapping sounds .
tr	3	A small dresser and table stood in the one corner with a chair next to it , next to the port .
tr	2	Her room was comfortable but small ; not what she enjoyed at home , but for now it suited her purposes .
tr	2	Moreover , if Pedro 's good marksmanship was any indication , she would be a force to be reckoned with .
tr	1	With a gentle stroke to her still loose , wavy hair , shoulders straight and back rigid , she walked into the dining cabin .
tr	4	She never once noticed him , so close to her , and he could enjoy her beauty without any disturbances .
tr	4	The Falcon 's way with women was legendary , using them , breaking them until there was nothing left of the once beautiful woman .
tr	0	† † † February 28 , 1624 Today I had to deal with a situation in the village as part of land owner duties .
tr	1	I miss him when he leaves in the mornings to do his work but the reunion at night makes up for it .
tr	3	Father strapped me to his back and my mother to his chest and jump into the angry , cold waves .
tr	4	A few times , we went under into the cold depths , and just barely in time , emerged again .
tr	0	I can hardly wait to teach them all I know , about the sea , the land , about people .
tr	4	Roberto and his men 's faces were tense as they scurried around to change the flags from pirate to her father 's crest ensign .
tr	4	He cursed as he turned to Pierre with a quick move causing the chair to be unbalanced for a brief moment .
tr	0	I explained to her that the Captain had rules , and it did look as if I was running away .
tr	0	For the first time in days he was happy , laughing as his father dragged him through the water playfully .
tr	2	Although Roberto was the son of the Falcon , the Falcon would not hesitate to kill him for disobeying a direct order .
tr	0	Pierre could warn him of any lurking dangers ; and once again , Roberto had to speculate about the ship and its crew .
tr	3	The agony of the last two days , without food or water followed by the blow against her head felt like torture .
tr	2	" Roberto , I hope you are not serious about doing what I think you are going to do ? "
tr	3	He did not want to show disrespect for the man in front of the crew , but this was important .
tr	2	Too afraid to move , she never went outside for water or food , the risk too great to take .
tr	3	" We are already two days behind them and it will cost us another day or two to catch them .
tr	4	Sitting down on the chair she had left , he leaned back and closed his eyes , a smile on his handsome face .
tr	4	She was a novelty in these times where women were only expected to have children and do household chores , staying in the background .
tr	4	He watched as she listened to the conversation at the table , smiling sweetly at the men , and another emotion surged through him .
tr	0	It annoyed him and he pushed his chair away , stepping out into the passageway as the door slammed behind him .
tr	4	It was already late and Roberto decided to do it early in the morning , when most of those men would still be asleep .
tr	1	Her bosom was showing too much soft roundness for his taste , and her small waist was even more accentuated .
tr	4	She had never flaunted herself deliberately and felt self-conscious about it , but the reaction from Roberto surprised her in a good way .
tr	4	She rolled her eyes in disdain , sighed heavily at the mere thought , and touched her heart " Not a gentlemen at all .
tr	3	At the time , she thought it was odd for a pirate to ask this request , without any explanation .
tr	3	Both knew it was time to get out of there before the man got it in his head to sound the alarm .
tr	3	Proudly she sat in the long boat , shoulders straight , as Fausto took the oars and started to row away from the ship .
tr	4	The whole idea was preposterous but as he watched her it grew on him just as she grew on him .
tr	0	It annoyed him and he pushed his chair away , stepping out into the passageway as the door slammed behind him .
tr	1	Her bosom was showing too much soft roundness for his taste , and her small waist was even more accentuated .
tr	3	At the time , she thought it was odd for a pirate to ask this request , without any explanation .
tr	3	Both knew it was time to get out of there before the man got it in his head to sound the alarm .
tr	3	Proudly she sat in the long boat , shoulders straight , as Fausto took the oars and started to row away from the ship .
tr	3	At first he didn 't want to speak to me , shooing me away , but he couldn 't resist my childish charm . "
tr	4	" I continued speaking to him because , in my young heart , I was desperate for a father 's touch .
tr	0	It was more precious than gold at that time and as he said , he was not going to waste good bullets on animals .
tr	1	Suddenly shots broke the silence and we saw the captain looking frantically around and shooting blindly into the thick bushes .
tr	4	Before he left , he set some traps , in the hopes that small animals could be caught to prepare as meals . "
tr	0	After he regained his health , he arranged for a ship that was willing to wait for us and came back with enough food .
tr	4	My mother and half-sister were the only two able to stand , but they were exhausted in caring for everyone .
tr	0	He threw himself from the ship into the whirlpool of angry waters , knowing he was losing his mind . "
tr	0	The captain hoped that another ship would pass but after a week it did not happen and the food was already scarce .
tr	4	Heavy rains fell like buckets from the sky onto them and the strong winds blew them around like a feather on the ocean .
tr	4	Her chest burned and with one last desperate attempt she reached out her hand to be pulled back in , losing all consciousness .
tr	4	He finally saw her pale blue dress bobbing in the swells , her head disappearing at an alarming rate into the dark depths .
tr	4	He pounded on her back out of desperation to get the water out her lungs and much needed air in .
tr	4	Roberto was so relieved that he grabbed her body in a fierce embrace , kissing the ice-cold face with desperate kisses .
tr	1	The doctor wanted to carry her but Roberto just lifted her in his arms and carried her to her cabin .
tr	3	This does not change the fact that you are still a pirate and that I am the price of a sick scheme . "
tr	4	The hardened pirate was all soft and mellow in her presence and she learned more about him during this time .
tr	4	There was no rush in his action as he stroked her neck and shoulder and told her how beautiful she looked .
tr	4	When his eyes were used to the darkness around him , he saw two figures struggling on the port side .
tr	4	It was a while before they broke apart and he sat down and held her hand , visibly trembling with excitement .
tr	0	After breakfast he took her to his grand cabin and said , " I want us to get married today . "
tr	1	The pure thrill of being in his arms , of loving him was so new that it kept her up .
tr	3	For now he had to convince her that this marriage was important not only to him but to her safety .
tr	4	" Pierre is also a captain , " he said as a smile softened his own features and he pulled her closer .
tr	3	" I cannot help it , it is my nature , and you do this to me , my Rosa . "
tr	4	Her door was slammed open and she was unceremoniously thrown on her bed , drenched with the rain still pouring down outside .
tr	4	He ran below to where he thought it came from , down the passageway , until he reached her room .
tr	1	He froze at the picture in front of him , a smouldering pistol still in her hands , pointing at a man .
tr	3	Thinking of the naked body in his bed made his own to act in arousal , but that had to wait .
tr	4	When he put his arms around her , the sheets moved down , revealing a soft shoulder and the slope of her breast .
tr	3	That is all that matters " " If any harm should come to you I would never forgive myself , " he said softly .
tr	2	If you want to know the man you must look at his room that will tell you much about him .
tr	0	His scent was all over the cabin , a distinct smell that mixed with sea , wind , cigars and earth .
tr	4	I loved the land , the smell of breaking ground , the whole process of planting and waiting , and then the harvest . "
tr	4	16 " Veronica was raped on the first night , while we were still on the ship taking us to the Falcon 's lair .
tr	0	" At night Pedro had to tell us about the adventures on the sea and in Africa and he talked much about you .
tr	1	He could still feel her soft skin under his hand , the soft roundness of her curves as she burned with passion .
tr	0	She thought about her brother Manuel and the man he had become ; about Pedro and the path he had chosen for himself .
tr	4	When she looked for him later she found him sprawled on the bed , too tired to bother with the wet clothes .
tr	3	Softly she walked to him , just studying the broad back , ripped shirt , the narrow waist with the incredible long legs .
tr	3	He looked like the paintings they had on the walls in the study at home ; a portrait of masculinity and beauty .
tr	1	He tangled his hand into her hair , bringing her head down , and then kissed her with a burning passion .
tr	4	In return , she could enjoy every part of him , lingering at the places she came to recognize as his most sensitive spots .
tr	0	He would whisper about his life and future with her , sharing his heart , and she would do the same .
tr	2	" But , my Rose , you will have to trust me from now on to get us both out of the piracy life .
tr	4	He chuckled , a deep , rough noise that came from his throat , his beady eyes dark with cruelty .
tr	0	A pitcher with wine and glasses awaited them and a servant girl was already pouring it for them , hands shaking .
tr	4	This caused Tiny to smile widely so that you could see the empty gums , the beady eyes sparkling with glee .
tr	0	He had seen most of the known world , which she only heard from her father or had read about .
tr	0	He had a love for both land and sea as he talked about the farm , the land , his country and his parents .
tr	3	She had not mentioned it to him and knew she had to work through it if she wanted to continue to trust him .
tr	4	It clung around her and she found it difficult to breathe but it gave her the necessary courage to do what was expected .
tr	4	The rough hands kneaded her and he leaned forward to suckle a breast , biting the nub so that it stretched .
tr	0	He came closer again , looking at her abdomen , and again he raged , " She is with child ! "
tr	1	Why is it so hard to find a virgin in the world , especially one that is supposed to be a lady ? "
tr	2	Two windows framed each side of the wooden door and on both sides , closing with shutters , no glass in the panes .
tr	3	Father removed all their clothing to show the chief that they were too skinny after the lack of food during that time .
tr	3	The two slave girls still had enough on their bones to win his approval and they agreed without any struggle to stay behind .
tr	3	" I am so sorry that you had to go through that , but that was the only way that I could protect you .
tr	1	Whispering tender words in her ear , on her stomach , the vibrancy of every word causing her to arch into him .
tr	0	He would have to thank the man once he took her back , for he had prepared her for him without knowing him .
tr	4	He walked over to her and slapped her so hard that her head bounced back , slamming into the man who held her .
tr	1	" Roberto , my son , " the Falcon said with a snarl in his voice , mocking him with the endearing word .
tr	4	So infuriated was she with the man in front of her , she did not notice the buzz and then the silence .
tr	0	" I am Captain le Roux and I am here to arrest you , Falcon , you and your men . "
tr	0	He gave her his handkerchief , which she took with a small , delicate hand , whispering a " Thank you . "
tr	2	She was so small that he had to bend over to hold her , but for some reason it felt good .
tr	4	Pierre looked around , not sure what to do with her , but he wanted to spend more time with her .
tr	0	I made a deal with them that I would hand them Falcon on a platter if they would give me a break .
tr	0	" The Falcon was a bastard by anyone 's standards and was slipping through their fingers each time , creating havoc wherever he went .
tr	1	But now all was clear and she sighed in contentment , dropping her head on his shoulder , just drinking him in .
tr	1	" I recruited him when I met him ten months ago , " Roberto said with pride in his voice .
tr	4	Pierre and Nora were smitten with each other , walking along the beach just talking about everything , holding hands .
tr	1	Nora was happy about his new assignment and told him as much , enjoying the young Captain 's closeness and tenderness since they met .
tr	0	Nora was a well-bred lady who , after the ordeal and in his tender care , became a vibrant young woman .
tr	4	Her eyes blinked in the dark to take him in and she whispered , " Hey , what is wrong ? "
tr	4	" Your father ... " He lifted his eyes , filled with dread and terror instead of his normal stern expression .
tr	0	She turned her gaze back to him and laid a hand on the scarred cheek , beautiful and full of character .
tr	4	After four months of rolling seas , steady winds in the sails and beautiful weather they saw land beautifully edged on the horizon .
tr	1	As the busy harbour came into view , he felt his shoulders tense and his rigid posture as stiff as a plank .
tr	1	Roberto thought he was going to break her in two as his strong arms wrapped around the protruding belly of his pregnant wife .
tr	0	I have already handed my resignation in , and I plan to become the farmer I always wanted to be .
tr	4	He had one hand on the stretched belly and one hand under her face , the pouty lips warm and inviting .
tr	4	He could not help but smile , tenderly touching the soft skin and tracing every line on the youthful face .
tr	4	By the time they departed to their new homes , a journey of just over a week to France , the two women cried .
tr	4	Finan watched as Rafe considered the parchment before him , his fingers tracing the edge as he thought over his friend 's words .
tr	1	" I 'll do this thing my own way , Finan , nothing that you say will change my mind . "
tr	2	Do you suggest that I disregard a word of honour , my father 's word of honour , and refuse to have her ? "
tr	0	Rafe had watched the glory that he had worked so hard to attain in battle fade , tarnished with blood and misery .
tr	0	Finan was slightly taken aback by the seeming change of subject , and paused while searching for a suitable answer .
tr	3	One could postulate that this hesitation was natural in a bridegroom who had not met his betrothed and had little knowledge of her .
tr	4	He had seen the signs a thousand times before and recognised a certain recklessness that could only lead to turmoil .
tr	4	" I hope to ... " Rafe broke off again and reached out for the wine jug at his elbow .
tr	3	" There is something , I do not know what it is , that is strange about her manner of address . "
tr	3	As time went on it became more difficult to tell her a truth that would give embarrassment to us both . "
tr	3	Rafe twisted the goblet in his hand until the light from the fire struck the gems set into its rim , making them glow .
tr	4	Rafe 's eyes had been fixed firmly on the goblet but at this last , he turned again to Finan .
tr	1	Finan started forward in his chair , his fingers gripping the wooden arms with such strength that his knuckles were white .
tr	3	" My father , although it is true not enamoured of my plan , does not forbid that I carry it through . "
tr	2	" Or is it merely that you are prohibited by your position from telling me how many times a fool you think me ? "
tr	2	" I see ; I suppose I am to become one of those ' poor fools ' you pity so much ? "
tr	2	For the sake of your name you must have a son , and for your father 's honour you must marry the Lady Adele .
tr	0	Chapter Two To say that Lord Rafe was made uncomfortable by his father 's disapproval was something of an understatement .
tr	0	Rafe reached the door of his father 's apartments and halted , smoothing his hair across his brow and taking a deep breath .
tr	3	It didn 't occur to him that this little ritual might be considered strange in a man in his twenty eighth year .
tr	2	I know that this is not what you would have chosen for yourself , that it is hard for both you and her . "
tr	2	" One day you will have a son of your own , Rafe , and you will see that ' tis no easy thing .
tr	3	No matter how big he becomes , to you that is how he remains ; a tiny bundle that you must protect .
tr	0	Rafe made his way along the track that led through the huts and up the hill , and came to a guard post .
tr	0	Rafe watched the man look past him at the horse he was leading , and then back at the chain mail Rafe was wearing .
tr	0	The man rocked back on his heels and supported himself on his spear , looking up at Rafe with a faint air of apology .
tr	4	The top of her head hardly reached his chest , but whatever she lacked in stature she more than made up for in spirit .
tr	4	" Your master writes that he has sent , " she paused , taking up the letter again and reading aloud an excerpt .
tr	4	She regarded him again as though she could not quite reconcile the words in the letter to the man standing before her .
tr	3	In short , you cannot expect her to undertake any sort of hardship , she is far too delicate for that . "
tr	4	Of what use do you suppose Lady Adele will be to her people , people who have waited sixteen years for her return ? "
tr	4	It was not the voice that Rafe would have recognised as belonging to her , filled as it was with tender warmth .
tr	4	" It seems you are to leave me , Adele ; an escort has arrived to take you to your new home . "
tr	0	Of all things she prayed that Lord Rafe was a good man who would be kind in all his dealings with Adele .
tr	0	The chief reason for this lack of pique was that Lady Adele had always thought Lord Rafe to be kind .
tr	4	He need not have had much interaction with her until their wedding day , but he had always been kind and generous .
tr	2	The soft light coming through the narrow window was reflected on the polished wood and it glowed with soft luminosity .
tr	2	Pulling the soft furs around her to shut out the cold , she ran her fingers over the smooth wood .
tr	4	The grain of the wood varied beneath her fingertips , and she opened the lid and withdrew one of the parchments from within .
tr	3	It was fortunate that Rafe was unaware of this , for it would have unsettled him horribly to have known .
tr	3	He turned on to his side on the narrow bed , as if the movement would shut out such thoughts .
tr	3	His words , impersonal and cold as the frost , allayed any thought that his conduct toward her would soften as time went on .
tr	0	The same words as he had said to the ladies , would have caused no such outrage if spoken to a man .
tr	3	He did not linger at the task but was , at the next second , seated upon his own mount .
tr	0	How could she have been thinking about walking through fields of flowers when she might have known Eda was unhappy ?
tr	3	This observation struck her as amusing , and she promptly forgot that she was not in the best of humours with him .
tr	3	Eda turned away abruptly , hiding her tears that what little dignity she had left to her might remain intact .
tr	4	Her voice was quiet and a little husky , the sort of voice with which to whisper an endearment , it was somehow caressing .
tr	0	He would carry you through the heaviest of fighting at a charge , and he would not panic or flinch . "
tr	1	" Finan ... Finan ... " Adele tested the name , rolling it around her mouth with a frown of concentration .
tr	1	" If you wish , my lady , " answered Rafe , his voice was stiff , and he moved restlessly on his mount .
tr	3	Suddenly he had seen that his father was right : he could not win her trust only to destroy it with a petty deception .
tr	3	No , that wasn 't quite correct ; he had seen the pit falls but had thought the means necessary to the end .
tr	1	" It could be said that I know him better than anyone , " replied Rafe giving in with a sigh .
tr	4	Having hobbled his horse , he approached Lady Adele and Eda with the obvious intention of helping them to dismount .
tr	1	" It will be fine , Eda , can you not see that Finn is making a fire for us ? "
tr	4	" Yes , one of the ladies , I assume she was the cook , was kind enough to provide me with them . "
tr	0	" Many is the lad who wished he had stuck to farming after a hard days march , " answered Rafe with a shrug .
tr	4	He wrapped a piece in rye bread and held it out to Adele first , along with a wine skin .
tr	3	He told them nothing of the aftermath of battle which was , in its own way , just as horrific .
tr	1	His sword was at his side , along with his bow and spear ; it was possible that they could make it .
tr	0	His sword crashed against that of his adversary and he pushed the blade aside , delivering a heavy blow to the man 's jaw .
tr	4	Chapter Seven They rode through the trees until the grey light of dawn filtered through the bare branches and they came across a creek .
tr	1	Rafe felt a sudden and uncomfortable sensation in the pit of his stomach , caused by the ruthless removal of all his solid facts .
tr	3	" But you said that it was better for you to make a stand and not come with us . "
tr	4	They have as little rest as you do , but in between must carry your dead weight , " reasoned Rafe .
tr	4	Adele was obliged to pause and lean over the horse with her hands pressed against the bodice of her dress as she laughed .
tr	4	She had not thought that Rafe was attending or that , if he was , he had merely been suffering her conversation .
tr	4	Every thought scurried away into the dark recesses of his brain , save for the one that told him he was in deep trouble .
tr	0	He was some years younger than Lord Rafe and Finan , and had a levity of manner that some might say was inordinate .
tr	1	God was always there to give lives direction , knowing in his infinite wisdom that which was best for each and every person .
tr	3	He shivered uncomfortably , as though just discussing the atrocities of the past had brought an oppressive atmosphere of evil into their midst .
tr	2	At first he had not noticed , his head was too full of plans and worries for him to spare a thought for conversation .
tr	4	However , for a long while he had been conscious of the deafening silence between them , and had been made uncomfortable by it .
tr	0	She looked up at him , not having heard what he had said but knowing that he had addressed her .
tr	4	He had the feeling that she was not requesting confidences , but merely seeking reassurance ; the comfort of companionship with another person .
tr	4	Rafe heard Eda scream as , for a few dangerous moments , the slippery ground gave way beneath the horse .
tr	4	The words had not left his mouth before he found himself fighting for his balance , and he heard Adele laughing ever harder .
tr	1	She didn 't know why Eda couldn 't see that Finn had not expected an answer , did not want an answer .
tr	3	That would mean the assuming of yet another name , and Rafe could hardly see that that would help the situation .
tr	3	The thought of just what was to come about from these many and complicated little deceptions , brought him out in a cold sweat .
tr	0	At least , he might have had a vague notion that such and such was prettier than so and so .
tr	3	Quite apart from the natural antipathy he felt towards such a course , he had always known that there would have been little point .
tr	4	Somewhere down there was a river , but the carpet of trees made it invisible even from this height up on the rise .
tr	3	Bron recognised his master 's tone , and knew that he had better go about his master 's order without question or hesitation .
tr	0	Finan saw the steam that rose from them , and could smell on the air a spicy , sweet aroma .
tr	0	" And if ever I catch you playing such a trick again I will beat you , do I make myself clear ? "
tr	4	He helped her to dismount and she moved into the shelter under the out crop of rock , Eda close behind her .
tr	4	She could feel the gentle and accidental pressure of Rafe against her , a circumstance that she could not but be acutely conscious of .
tr	2	Your pardon , Finn , I did not mean to make you uncomfortable ... I fear I am very tiresome tonight . "
tr	0	He had two sisters , yet Finan had none , only brothers , so which truth did he tell her ?
tr	0	Rafe was lost in thought again , a heavy frown creasing his brow that lent a bitter cast to his face .
tr	3	Looking out into the darkness he wished that whoever it was that followed them would strike and end his discomfort .
tr	1	His sword was drawn in his hand but his grip was loose , as though he had little intention of using it .
tr	4	Eventually it had been too much , and he had risen from his bed and crept out of the camp .
tr	0	He could have walked across the space that separated them and finish finally what his father had started all those years before .
tr	3	His closeness to Adele , but his inability to get closer , was a sweet torment that both frustrated and yet excited him .
tr	2	Bron smoothed a hand over the skin of his neck which still tingled from the touch of Rand 's sword .
tr	3	Rand did not reply , but turned back to his contemplation of those beneath the shelter of the out crop .
tr	1	His hand , as it clasped his sword , gripped with such fierceness that the sinews stood out from the bone .
tr	1	Their strength is as great as our own , we should be stirring a hornets ' nest of unrest . "
tr	4	" Yes , well , as that may be , there is a reason for such behaviour , " answered Lord Brogan .
tr	0	" ' Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy , ' I have out grown such things . "
tr	1	" Yes , I should imagine that it is , " Lord Brogan answered , taking a sip of his wine .
tr	4	He had stirred at some point during the night , and his arm was no longer covered by the cloak .
tr	4	" Unfortunately , yes , my lady , " replied Rafe , " and we should resume our journey as quickly as possible . "
tr	3	" Yes , I suggest you breakfast well for we will not stop again today until we make camp tonight . "
tr	2	Eda waited for Rafe to respond to her question , but he said nothing and continued to apportion the food in silence .
tr	0	She had thought that he would ignore Eda 's question but now he answered , the words coming hard and bitter from his mouth .
tr	2	" You were so insistent that we take our food , Finn , and yet look : you forgot your own . "
tr	0	Rafe paused , taking a deep breath and staring at a bare patch of earth kicked up by the horses .
tr	1	" You are mistaken if you suppose that I should be so disloyal to him as to let you speak such things . "
tr	0	It seemed suddenly a hard thing to slide his arm around her waist and lift her onto the great animal 's back .
tr	0	Adele did not look at him again , she stared rigidly down at Charger 's mane as though it absorbed all her attention .
tr	2	Life within a house full of women could not but be filled , upon occasion , with a certain nervous tension .
tr	4	She could not but be sorry for it , she understood the trouble that she and Eda were to him .
tr	2	" That explains how you know me , what it does not explain is why you followed me to this place . "
tr	3	" I have no interest in the trivial differences of others , I will not take part in this matter .
tr	4	Rafe wished he felt such a certainty but did not depress her hopes with his own , less cheerful , reading of the situation .
tr	0	Maybe Eda was right ; it was possible that the hunting party would not come this way again but was now far away .
tr	0	Abruptly Rafe pulled Valiant to a standstill and , sliding from the horse , reached an imperative hand up to Eda .
tr	4	Rafe watched them calmly , his eyes alert to their every movement , before suddenly launching upon them a ferocious attack .
tr	0	He turned his head , wincing as pain shot through him , and his cheek touched the cold dirt floor .
tr	3	It was something he had no craving to comprehend , and it was certainly not an activity he intended to participate in .
tr	2	" Of course it did not occur to you that I might be pleased to have him out of my way .
tr	0	He was an embarrassment , a fool who had no thought in his head except for that of his next drink .
tr	2	Mine is bound by the bonds of honour , for goodness knows that we have no love for each other .
tr	2	" So know your fate : I will turn you back onto my lands without horse , bow , axe , or spear .
tr	3	" If that is your wish , I merely thought that you might care to rest a little and take some food first . "
tr	1	Anxiety became evident in Rand 's eyes , and Bron noticed tension beginning to build up in his master 's frame .
tr	0	Lord Rand was of a secretive nature , a circumstance that had caused great friction between him and his father .
tr	0	Finn had said to carry on , and if that is what Finn had said , then it was what they must do .
tr	3	The thought of those following them , those who had attacked them that first night at the camp , filled her with a fear .
tr	3	" This from the man who has spent the last hour staring out into the mists in search of nothing ! "
tr	3	At that point there had been no action , in fact there had still been hope that negotiation could be made .
tr	4	He was just in time to see the colour flee from Finan 's face , a circumstance he had rarely witnessed in his friend .
tr	0	The prize over which they had fought was an apple that had chanced to fall over the wall of the orchard .
tr	0	" Finally you meet him and all that you have to say of him was that he was not so tall as Finn ? "
tr	0	He could hear the sound of horses , not only behind him , but also hemming him in on each side .
tr	1	One man urged his horse forwards , breaking rank with the other riders , and coming closer to where Rafe stood .
tr	0	" You are a long way from Mercia , Rand , take my advice and leave Wessex while you still may . "
tr	3	" It is not your argument so you will allow them to beat what little sense they possess out of each other ? "
tr	1	" Well I am , perfectly , which is more than will be said of you when I am finished !
tr	2	" Good , for ' tis you who would probably come off the loser , you clumsy great oaf ! "
tr	0	His hand clenched on his sword and he jerked it roughly from its sheath , flinging it to the ground .
tr	0	Rafe was uncomfortable in the knowledge that whatever it was that Rand wanted , he had a certain amount of leverage .
tr	4	His friend 's voice seemed to penetrate the fog of rage around Rafe 's brain , and he stopped his struggling .
tr	3	" Nevertheless you will find that it is true ; my only wish is to bring comfort to Adele . "
tr	4	" It would be best if you went back to your men , you need to set up camp before nightfall . "
tr	0	There was so much to be said , or maybe that was wrong and there was actually nothing to say .
tr	4	His voice was almost begrudging but after a moment he spoke again , his natural honesty needing to see fair play .
tr	2	" If that is how you feel , Finan , you know I will not force you , " answered Rafe .
tr	4	He disliked the ease with which they caused trouble ; between each other , between vying suitors , and even upon occasion between kingdoms .
tr	0	He had hidden his own sadness from them as much as he could , not wishing to burden them with anything more .
tr	3	All three men turned to stare at the small figure that rushed through the aperture of the tent and into Rafe 's arms .
tr	1	King Ine was not really attending to him anymore , but was staring at the missive in his hand in great perplexity .
tr	2	King Ine was looking disturbed , his eyes troubled , and a droop to his shoulders that worried Lord Brogan .
tr	1	It was so unknown , so powerful , trapping her , tangling her in a vast web of confusing emotions and loyalties .
tr	4	" Maybe it is our intervention Rafe is unwilling to take , it does not follow that he deems our counsel incorrect . "
tr	1	" This is different ; Lady Adele will be his bride , this thing touches his pride and honour . "
tr	0	" Considering that the principals in this affair are asleep , I leave you in control of a peaceful camp .
tr	4	He took full advantage of the position he found himself in , and wielded his sword with the precision of an expert .
tr	1	The spear struck Finan in his side , making him lurch forwards over Brute in surprised hurt , his sword falling from numb fingers .
tr	1	Around him he could hear the sound of men running this way and that , shouting loudly to one another .
tr	0	Bron had his spear in his hand , his attitude alert and ready for the fight he knew was upon them .
tr	4	" We could not hold them together either , you must fetch Lord Rafe 's men : now go ! "
tr	0	As the horse and rider came abreast of him , Rand caught his arm and dragged him from his mount .
tr	3	" No , the fever is yet in him , he talks still but I cannot make out that which he is saying . "
tr	3	" There is no way to tell , but he 's strong ; he should be able to fight it . "
tr	1	Because Finn , and she could not help but keep thinking of him by that name , was standing staring grimly at the floor .
tr	0	She hung her head , if he knew he would think she had not a loyal bone in her body .
tr	3	I had not meant for it to cause you discomfort , " he spoke stiffly , his uncertainty making the words diffident .
tr	3	It is why I have told you the truth ; I did not wish you to hear it from anyone else . "
tr	0	He was looking at her as though he had sought to find something , but she had been found wanting .
tr	2	" Only look at the two of us ; we do not play this game of love very well , do we ? "
tr	0	It was your father 's offer on your behalf and I cannot recall any mention of your heart at the time . "
tr	3	" You mistake the matter ; should I wish to be rid of her I could accomplish the task without your help . "
tr	3	His trepidation seemed to stem from the worry that he would not make his wife happy , and that this unhappiness would be mutual .
tr	0	Her voice was brisk , trying to hide how much this man 's concern for his friend had moved her .
tr	4	The daylight had faded an hour since and , as she passed into the tent , she blinked against the brightness of the fire .
tr	4	Her fingers were cold from the night air , but even so she knew that he was much too hot .
tr	4	After an eternity it seemed as though Finan was a little cooler , surely he seemed more restful and moved less ?
tr	1	It seemed an almost impossible task and she shifted her pose , stifling a groan as her aching muscles protested .
tr	2	He took the cloth from her loose grip and , looking over her at someone who stood behind , jerked his head slightly .
tr	4	She stumbled a little over his name , but he was glad she had made the effort to used it .
tr	4	Adele seemed unaware of his stare but Rafe remembered , with a sickening lurch , how close Rand had stood to her chair .
tr	4	Rafe looked again to where Adele kneeled beside Finan , her hand gently pushing the damp hair back from his brow .
tr	4	So I will be given the opportunity to avenge my honour by ending his life , and your task will be complete ? "
tr	0	When he arrived I was to kill him and make it appear as though a raiding party from Mercia was responsible .
tr	3	He had only left Finan 's side long enough to walk them back to their tent and station two guards to keep them safe .
tr	1	" I suppose you had no choice , " he conceded grudgingly , but his eyes still burned with the indignity of it all .
tr	0	Rand ran his hand over his head and , grasping a handful of hair , gave it a sharp tug .
tr	3	" Do not dare to think that which you are thinking , or I will throttle the lot of you !
tr	1	" I think Finan is wondering if I am still under the impression that I am betrothed to him . "
tr	4	" I do not wish to be uncivil , my lady , but you relieve my mind greatly , " answered Finan reassured .
tr	4	Adele had not expected to be followed and so had allowed a few tears to fall from her brimming eyes .
tr	0	" Finan was fostered into my family before I was born and has always been as a true brother to me .
tr	0	Rafe and Adele sprang apart guiltily at the sound of Rand 's voice , and a crimson wave of colour suffused Adele 's features .
tr	2	All he had wanted was a son that would make him proud , who would follow in his illustrious footsteps .
tr	3	He thought himself the best of good fellows , and it never occurred to him that others did not share that view .
tr	2	Their friendship was looked upon as something of an oddity , and sometimes Brogan himself did not know how it had sprung up .
tr	4	" This young pup takes every opportunity to remind me that he always believed you could escape those who followed you .
tr	4	" It seems to me that we have met before , you and I , " he remarked at length .
tr	0	It was not unpleasant or smug , merely a calm acceptance of due appreciation for the part he had played .
tr	3	" My bride 's safety is my concern ; you may be assured that I will not neglect my duty in that direction . "
tr	2	Do you not see that I already know that you could never do such a thing as your father did ? "
tr	4	Chapter Twenty Nine Rafe suffered an uncomfortably restless night and had no trouble laying the blame firmly at Adele 's door .
tr	0	Adele cleared her throat nervously and Rafe , called back to his surroundings , snatched his hand away from her .
tr	0	" He has always wished to , although I do not think he knew it until he felt her beyond his reach . "
tr	3	It seemed that she did not intend that he should escape voicing his own wish that the betrothal would continue .
tr	1	She smiled , a rather inviting smile to Rafe 's way of thinking , and leaned fractionally closer to him .
tr	3	I thought that , if it was no great trouble to you , we might try it once more . "
tr	4	With an impatient movement he pulled the sword from its sheath at his side , and handed it to Adele .
tr	2	He retired across the room to rub the offending area gingerly , whilst casting black looks to both of the occupants of the chamber .
tr	3	When in situations of great stress his control always slipped , and he found he could do little to prevent it .
tr	2	They allow us to do as we wish , and yet present our actions to the world as an illusion we call nobility . "
tr	0	He had brought his sword over his head to block the blow that he knew would fall , and reached for his dagger .
tr	3	" I do not think that Rand will be able to restrain him , but you will know what to do . "
tr	4	It hadn 't been what he had planned to declare , but somehow he had spoken before he could stop himself .
tr	3	" I did not mean that ; I meant that I was sorry for how I behaved to you . "
tr	3	" You think it a dishonour that I should realise that my behaviour toward you was not what it should have been ? "
tr	3	" And so you shall , but first I shall show you what it is to be treated with dishonour ! "
tr	3	" If I had thought that you would be so enthusiastic , nothing could have made me wait this long . "
tr	2	" Eda , if I ask you something , something you might not like , would you answer me ? "
tr	3	" I could not tell you that until first you had told me ... " She broke off swallowing with difficulty .
tr	3	" You did not know the truth , and I confess that I did not wish you to learn it .
tr	2	Now it was up to her ; she must go to him , for he would never ask her to .
tr	0	Rand pulled away , his arm falling from her waist , and she realised that she had been silent too long .
tr	0	" You have always been kind enough to call me ' Lady Eda ' , but we both know that I am no lady .
tr	2	I suppose I was too young to cook and clean , and not strong enough to help on the farm .
tr	2	" Not with me , " he stated firmly , " for I know how to handle you ... do I not ? "
tr	3	He took them to Rafe 's tent and left them with assurance that Lady Adele would be with them shortly .
tr	2	Lord Brogan took in the thick plait of hair , large soft eyes , and smooth skin , before replying to her salutation .
tr	0	However , on my arrival I found not only that he had departed , but that also Finan is unavailable . "
tr	3	That the exterior was misleading he had no doubt , something told him that this pretty little girl had a fiery core .
tr	2	" I did not like to think of you forced into a course because none other was open to you . "
tr	1	" Yes , of course ; it was his bravery that earned him his position as adviser to King Ine . "
tr	3	It stretched on for so long that Rand almost decided to leave , despite the fact that the tent was his quarters .
tr	3	Rand was following with Eda , but had shown enough understanding to take a different route to their shared destination .
tr	2	" I promise you ; the day we wed no one will have any doubt as to my perfect satisfaction with my groom . "
tr	1	No stranger to loss , the precariously balance world she has constructed begins to fracture when Ben starts asking questions about her past .
tr	2	" I 'd hoped for days you 'd been building up the courage to ask me out with sweaty palms and an out-of-control heartbeat .
tr	4	The boy should spend hours planning the date and picking out the perfect desserts and the right clothes to wear to impress her . "
tr	3	And is it true that your only intention and motivation were to get closer to the girl for your career purposes ? "
tr	0	I narrowed my eyes , and a grin spread across my face as an utterly evil idea sprang into mind .
tr	4	With shaky fingers , I rushed to unbutton his pants and slide them off , revealing navy blue boxer briefs .
tr	3	The light from the Eiffel Tower and the street lamps still cast a romantic glow but this night had become anything but romantic .
tr	4	If I hadn 't been all cute and flirty and tied Malcolm up , he 'd be much better off .
tr	1	I hadn 't heard any gunshot pings since I ran away , since Malcolm got shot , since our date got ruined .
tr	4	I wasn 't sure how long I stayed or if I even nodded off here and there , but he never came .
tr	0	I could 've at least asked him some questions first or talked about my hurt feelings in a rational way .
tr	0	I looked at a clump of dried gel hanging from a hair above Dad 's ear , anywhere but at his eyes .
tr	4	At the top , Aimee and I helped each other hook the zip line cables onto our belts and tighten the safety straps .
tr	2	I couldn 't look down for long because my stomach felt queasy and vertigo hit me like a sugar high .
tr	4	Sweat tickled my armpits and dotted my forehead as the cement and the heads of the people swung back and forth in my vision .
tr	3	I wanted to burst out that I 'd tried , but the guy I thought I 'd killed just showed up alive .
tr	2	Walking through the hallways that would soon be bustling with tourists , I headed to the Vien Room on the second floor .
tr	3	With my chest heaving and my breath shooting out in short gasps , I waited in a shorter line for the elevator .
tr	0	I recognized it , a scarf with threads of a paisley blue and yellow , and the lady had brown hair .
tr	3	The Eiffel Tower clue was a basic code that sent them off on a treasure hunt through the most famous historical sites of Paris .
tr	4	Eight Peyton 's eyes burned into me like they were lasers and I was a metal wall he was trying to blast through .
tr	0	I think in the Spy Games handbook it says -- " He shot back , " I know what the handbook says .
tr	2	If I were a real spy with any good instincts , words would have slipped out and cooled him off .
tr	1	Gray , Nancy , and Frankie tried not to look at me , shuffling their feet , fixing their hair .
tr	1	I 'd burst into the room , pull out my gun , and the intruder would run for his life .
tr	2	The whole Spy Games staff was outside my front door , and I had thousands of dollars spread out on the table .
tr	0	It said how sorry she was for the short notice , and that she 'd be in touch when she got back .
tr	3	I 'm known to be pretty loquacious but I couldn 't quite find the right words to express my shock .
tr	3	" I can 't argue that you didn 't take time to get to know me before our date . "
tr	1	" Hope you don 't mind spending a lot of time with me , " he said with mischief in his smile .
tr	3	Just yesterday morning , before the start of the games , I 'd told her about my date with Malcolm .
tr	4	Her wispy white hair was held up by bobby pins and she wore a faded , flowered smock that looked like a relic .
tr	2	With a warm hand on my waist , which I tried to ignore , Malcolm said , " Good one down there .
tr	4	I whipped out my cell and sent an email to my home computer , reminding myself to check up on Marie next week .
tr	4	On my knees , I wiggled the end of the paper clip into the small keyhole of the bottom drawer .
tr	0	" I was hoping we 'd have a bit more time to pay off those loans , " Dad said .
tr	4	" No way , " I muttered and took a few steps back , dragging him with me to give Peyton space .
tr	3	For the umpteenth time that day I had to fight the urge to pull out my phone and text Aimee .
tr	1	I didn 't shower or brush my hair , and I raided almost every single carb we had stored in the cupboard .
tr	0	I finally showered and threw on my dad 's oversized white T-shirt that said " pastry chef " and a pair of jeans .
tr	1	I spent a few hours whipping egg whites into a meringue , dicing strawberries , and attempting to turn confectioner 's sugar into frosting .
tr	0	I pulled out our travel pack of games -- checkers , Backgammon , and chess -- and played against myself .
tr	4	I played the role of the crab while searching Malcolm 's face for the sly wink that told me there was more to this .
tr	0	He had to understand I wasn 't here to bat my eyelashes at him and that my focus was on finding Aimee .
tr	0	I swear I was a walking commercial for patchwork quilts , and not in a cozy cottage kind of way .
tr	0	Just so you know , I was the understudy for Aunt Spike from James and the Giant Peach in a third grade play . "
tr	1	I pictured me and Aimee riding on the bike , dodging squirrels in the path until we 'd give up and walk .
tr	4	He led me down narrow paths overhung with tree branches and ferns , and with no one around , we jogged .
tr	2	After gasping a bit , I stepped onto the first wooden plank , swallowing down my breakfast and refusing to look below .
tr	0	I wanted to find Aimee , and I couldn 't give Peyton any more of a head start than he already had .
tr	1	I couldn 't stand there , next to Malcolm , so I ran and ran and ran until I couldn 't breathe .
tr	0	" I 'll play out any fantasy for you , Savvy Bent , if it will keep a smile on your face . "
tr	3	I stared at the water far , far below us , just waiting for a victim to fall into its clutches .
tr	3	I pressed into his warmth , but my thoughts stayed on the fact that I 'd gotten shot at twice .
tr	3	That during this year away from home , I won 't be able to meet up to his expectations . "
tr	4	The whole being married pretense was dropped and even though he sat next to me , he didn 't touch me .
tr	4	Some friends are willing to die for each other but our friendship was new , just budding , needing sunlight to grow .
tr	2	Gripping the bottom of the window , I let my body scrape against the wood as I slowly lowered it .
tr	1	Inch by inch , I raised my head until I could peek into the kitchen window past the ruffled curtains .
tr	0	I had no idea why , and I wasn 't any closer to figuring out what had happened to her .
tr	3	His big old belly protruded out and if he swung at the right time he could take someone out with it .
tr	2	" You can joke , girl , but I promise , no one pulls a fast one on me . "
tr	3	The judges had to taste my entry -- even though I hadn 't made it -- and that was all that mattered .
tr	3	With light footsteps , I went into what felt like the underworld with no clue what demons I would find .
tr	3	I held my breath on the stairs , afraid of creaks , but then let it out at the bottom .
tr	1	Even in the freezer , a hot flush spread across my skin , causing goosebumps to rise on my goosebumps .
tr	1	My mind whirled , and I had to suck in air in shallow gasps so they didn 't hear me .
tr	2	At last , when they left through the front door , I clumsily crawled onto the wooden planks of the floor .
tr	0	I rubbed my stiff hands across my arms and legs , but I didn 't have time to lay here and thaw .
tr	4	I crossed the living room into the kitchen and eased the pan onto the stovetop , then positioned myself behind the kitchen table .
tr	1	My friends always thought she was kinda weird because she 'd spend hours in the backyard , shooting at targets .
tr	0	As he rubbed my back and ran his fingers through my hair , I didn 't know how to feel .
tr	0	But I also knew that from our very first date Malcolm had an interest in my family and Malcolm worked for Jolie .
tr	4	I gave in and whispered , " After she returned from a trip , I looked through her stuff and found some secret documents .
tr	1	I think she was some kind of , " I paused as his eyes grew wider , " spy . "
tr	0	Her grandmother 's cottage was abandoned , the neighbor warned me to stay away , and I had no leads .
tr	4	As Gray finished up his end of the meeting , Dad shuffled papers ready to embark on a long list of to-dos .
tr	1	Mine can snore away , mouth open , drool spilling , and still know what 's going on around him .
tr	3	I looked a little bit like the wannabe spies I mocked , but I wasn 't going to dwell on that .
tr	1	I stopped rushing around and let my eyes wander the kitchen , taking in everything slowly , not missing an inch .
tr	3	In less than three seconds , I slammed the laptop shut and crawled into the tiny closet that wasn 't meant for people .
tr	1	I tried my hardest not to picture him ripping off his shirt and revealing his impeccable pecs , which I 'd seen before .
tr	1	If I kept my nose to the trail , I 'd find my mom , but Malcolm had to think I 'd given up .
tr	4	He moved into the chair right next to me and pulled it up , so his knees surrounded my legs .
tr	3	He didn 't say anything at first but ran his fingers through my hair to tuck it behind my ear .
tr	2	" I 'm afraid you 'll take it a step too far ... and try to spy on Jolie by yourself .
tr	3	He chatted with customers , instructed a new waiter , and then took off down the street at a brisk stroll .
tr	4	When my breathing got back under control , I dashed across the small yard until I reached Jolie 's house .
tr	4	I clasped my hands together to keep myself from hurdling the bushes , grabbing a potted fern and knocking him out .
tr	3	Our traditions revolved around the latest gadgets for listening in on a conversation or how to put the biggest scare into clients .
tr	2	" Why don 't you think about how wrong your actions were , and I 'll be back later . "
tr	3	I strode into the kitchen , confident , in control , ready to take on the world of espionage with the best of them .
tr	2	But I 've pulled shooting blanks at our clients from the program , for now , until this dies down . "
tr	3	" Don 't think , " I stuffed pancakes in my mouth , " that I can 't see what you 're doing . "
tr	3	I lifted my head straight back and stared up at the stone structure carved with so many saints and intricate details .
tr	4	Sometimes I 'd love to touch the iron fence , the right one , and I 'd travel back in time . "
tr	2	From the outside , I had to look like I was enjoying myself , out on a date with a cute boy .
tr	2	I went to the door of the bathroom and peeked outside , hoping to find Malcolm waiting for me with two drinks .
tr	3	The golden sun rested in the lower half of the sky , but I couldn 't find warmth in its rays .
tr	0	Brief thoughts of whacking him over the head with the crowbar passed through my mind but then he zipped his pants back up .
tr	2	I scooted back across the wooden floors , ready to run , escape , and eat donuts for the next two hours .
tr	3	After scrambling to my feet , water still dripping from my hair and clothes , I ran down the stairs and into the kitchen .
tr	3	I should get my freakin ' ass out of there and walk -- no run -- straight to my dad and tell him everything .
tr	3	I couldn 't be foolish about plunging into a dark pit that probably didn 't lead to a nice , lighted cellar .
tr	0	All the spy gadgets and granola bars in my backpack wouldn 't help me in what were probably the catacombs under Paris .
tr	2	And he carried a small tool chest in his other hand , probably filled with corkscrews , pliers , and nail files .
tr	2	Maybe he knew about the package and the instructions to shoot him , so he grabbed Mom and tortured her for information .
tr	0	My legs moved with the fear of a whip wrapping around them at any second , or kissing my back .
tr	3	I 'd cave at the first sight of the pliers heading toward my teeth or at the first snap of the whip .
tr	3	But if it was information on Mom they wanted or her secrets , I wouldn 't be able to tell them .
tr	3	They continued back and forth , their words coming out in surges as they made their way up the stairs .
tr	0	Classic case of a girl abandoned by her mommy and trying to make up for it by pretending to be Martha Stewart . "
tr	3	As they kept talking , I stood straighter , trying to control my rage at Malcolm 's cheap shots at me .
tr	0	They advanced toward me , so I did what any panicked girl caught spying on a famous French pastry chef would do .
tr	1	If I was lucky , Malcolm and Jolie didn 't even know who it was spying on them from the stairs .
tr	1	I hated butting into other people 's business and living life like a trapeze artist , constantly afraid of falling and dying .
tr	3	I didn 't want the answer to it , because then I 'd have to admit that my emotions had been manipulated .
tr	2	My arm twitched , and I had to grab onto it to stop myself from slugging him a good one .
tr	0	This whole thing , you and me , flirting and having fun , has been a game , a charade , a distraction .
tr	0	In that one conversation I 'd gone through fear , anger , hurt , betrayal , heartache , and back to anger .
tr	3	At home , I slipped in through my bedroom window , leaving a trail of dirt against the outside of the apartment .
tr	2	I slid out of bed , grabbed the heaviest book on my shelf , and stood to the side of my door .
tr	4	If someone usually slams the door and grumbles on entering , then he should always slam the door and grumble .
tr	4	The lines around his eyes were deeper and he seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders as he hunched over .
tr	2	Of course , I love having you here , but if you 'd rather be with your mom , I can work it out .
tr	4	I ran my fingers over them , and the pulse shocked my fingertips and spread like wildfire up through my arms .
tr	0	After completing a series of karate kicks and floor drops and ninja turns -- that I totally made up -- I did them again .
tr	3	I couldn 't keep training like this or I wouldn 't be able to walk to the Extravaganza finals the next day .
tr	3	The guilt that hung over this box could finally leave because for the first time , it would get put to good use .
tr	1	I attacked each one like I was going for Olympic gold , scribbling furiously , a smile spreading across my face .
tr	0	I kinda missed those days when Malcolm and I would flirt and do spy stuff together instead of against each other .
tr	1	I mean I hadn 't turned my back on spying , just on my laziness when it came to working for Dad .
tr	4	Especially if I tripped and my toes nudged the door open all the way and I just kinda fell into the apartment .
tr	0	In the back of my closet I found a pair of black leather pants I 'd packed for the Paris nightlife .
tr	1	His hair was perfectly styled , not for vanity , but so it wouldn 't fall in his eyes while in the field .
tr	2	Maybe it was the only way to control his hair or maybe no one ever told him he used a bit too much gel .
tr	1	Dad pulled a clump of gel from the side of his hair , stalling , probably waiting for me to disappoint him .
tr	1	I 'd have to talk to Dad about investing in higher-quality devices , if he was really serious about this whole spy thing .
tr	0	He gave me a final push , and I broke my forward momentum by slamming my hands against his front counter .
tr	4	My fingers traced a path through the grime on the walls as I headed toward the door in the back .
tr	3	The water spilled down his throat and the sides of his mouth , making dark prints in the floor of the cavern .
tr	1	Instinctively , I screamed , dropped to the ground , and curled into a ball , waiting for a burst of pain .
tr	3	I stormed up the stairs , down the hallway , up more stairs , and burst into Jolie 's kitchen .
tr	0	I grabbed a tray of pastries and lifted it up in front of my face , a pitiful attempt at camouflage .
tr	0	And that was when I fully grasped the old cliché of , " You can 't have your cake and eat it too . "
tr	2	I spoke out the corner of my mouth as Jolie advanced through the crowds , the cameras and press following him .
tr	0	During Spy Games , I always disappointed , always made the wrong choice , always caused a scowl to cross his face .
tr	1	Slowly , his hand went from his beard , to the frosting on his shirt , and down to the sides of his pants .
tr	1	With a quick kick of my good leg , I made sure my jab landed right in Malcolm 's gut .
tr	3	I didn 't plan on saving Jolie like that , just cause a distraction so the creeps couldn 't get a clear shot .
tr	4	The pain seared my skin , and I felt like the fiery flames of hell were punishing me for my lies .
tr	2	How can I protect myself if I don 't know what 's going on or why people are after me ? "
tr	2	" Your family , your mom 's side of the family , will do anything to protect those persons in danger .
tr	1	His warmth spread through me like wildfire , igniting , growing , burning away the rest of the fear and tension .
tr	4	He leaned forward and pressed his face into my hair , then he dropped his head and tried to kiss me .
tr	1	Maybe I 'd end up on a YouTube video , get like a million hits , and wind up on TV .
tr	0	It was like I was in a mosh pit , except my destination was the back of a cop car .
tr	4	Smoke billowed out through the side doors of the high school gym in great puffy clouds , creating exactly the effect we 'd wanted .
tr	3	I nudged Jules and couldn 't help but glance at the trail through the woods that led to our getaway .
tr	0	What if I outran him to the waiting car and we ended up in a high-speed chase through the neighborhood ?
tr	3	" Then I guess you won 't mind coming down to the station and taking a polygraph while chatting with the detective . "
tr	3	" We 'll need time to talk to the school and think about this so we don 't make any rash decisions .
tr	2	" Maybe you 'd better take someone with you tomorrow morning when you go up and finish the road . "
tr	4	" Oh now this is getting ridiculous , " Steve grumbled and strode to one of the open garbage barrels .
tr	1	" So you 're saying they 're opening the barrel , looking inside then moving on without touching the contents ?
tr	4	The next morning , to his delight , all of the food was gone from the tray and the garbage drums were still locked .
tr	3	" Looks like you 're on to something Scott , " Steve smiled at the empty tray his brother brought into the kitchen .
tr	4	As he approached the barrels Scott saw something rise up from behind the drum and the apple floated up then disappeared .
tr	3	He heard the rustle of the thicket and stood motionless until the sound had vanished into the warm morning air .
tr	4	" Not really obsessed , " Scott replied as he slid the high powered rifle into the clips that were attached to the dashboard .
tr	3	Scott spent the entire day on the computer trying to find any information that he could link to the little girl .
tr	3	" If you wanted to get her something I 'd suggest a pair of jeans with an elastic waist though .
tr	3	Scott snapped as the truck turned off the highway and headed down the road that weaved through the tall timber toward the camp .
tr	3	The following morning , Scott Lyndon 's first stop was the third garbage drum and he smiled down at the empty tray .
tr	4	As he reached to pick it up he saw something fall from it and looked down to the ground to see the banana peel .
tr	4	Scott examined the little girl 's face and even though he saw fear there , he saw something else too .
tr	3	" Oh boy , " Scott said under his breath then looked from the bear to the little girl and back .
tr	3	" I 'm glad I left the rifle in the truck last night , " Steve said and started back for the truck .
tr	3	He looked at the little girl who was standing at the back of the truck watching him and he smiled and nodded at her .
tr	4	He opened the cap , squeezed a glob of it onto his finger and gently covered the animal 's wounds with it .
tr	4	He saw the girl 's questioning expression as she looked from the coyote to him and he smiled and nodded .
tr	0	" That was an experience and a half , " Steve said when his brother sank into a desk chair .
tr	4	Each night for the next three weeks Scott left food for the child and each morning the food was gone .
tr	3	It took him almost twenty minutes to reach the site and he spotted the Lyndon Logging trucks on the west side of the jam .
tr	3	" Well let 's see if we can 't pull that jam up enough to find out what it 's caught on . "
tr	2	If we try to move those logs that whole mess is going to come down on top of Chet . "
tr	0	Scott had to take a chance that it was the same bear and that it remembered him and he held out an open hand .
tr	0	" Alright , " Scott said and turning , came back down the hill toward the foreman at a slow pace .
tr	3	Scott decided he did not want to find out and picked up the tray silently and started back for the cabin .
tr	2	" Show you , " she said slowly then she nodded her head and added , " It 's ok . "
tr	3	Scott was not sure if the little girl would still be there but , to his surprise , she had not moved .
tr	3	If they could get even part way , they could hike the rest of the way as long as it was not too far .
tr	3	Any other child in a truck that had tons of buttons would be pushing them and wanting to see what they did .
tr	4	He steered the truck around several large boulders and knew they would not be able to go much farther by truck .
tr	3	It would be best if they did not try anything faster in case a drop off loomed up in front of them .
tr	2	Her expression told him she did not understand and he smiled and held up the radio then said , " Wait . "
tr	0	" Beyond the back forty from what I can tell , " Scott said with a frown as his gaze slid around the area .
tr	0	The path is gradual and winding then we have to backtrack about a quarter of a mile over the rock bed . "
tr	0	Scott saw the blue backpack a few feet ahead of the animal and realized they had arrived at their destination .
tr	4	When Sidney stopped by the blue backpack Scott came up beside her and looked at the twisted mass of bones .
tr	0	After pulling out a jacket and a pair of gloves Scott found several days of rations and a map book for hikers .
tr	0	The map had several blue and red lines on it , each one marking a trail that was in this part of the mountains .
tr	2	" Mommy and Daddy said he had to go to sleep and would sleep for a really long time . "
tr	3	Scott wasn 't so sure about that but he took her word for it and grabbed the radio then slid out of the truck .
tr	3	He chose two pair ; one black and one blue , that he thought would fit then looked at the shirts .
tr	1	I 'm hoping she 'll bring it to me and that it will have some kind of ID in it . "
tr	3	" Better slow ... " Just then something hit the truck with a loud thud , breaking off his sentence .
tr	3	Scott read the membership card from the Audubon Society stating that ' Steven Southington ' was a member in good standing .
tr	0	We have no family as both Susan and I were foster children who lost our parents at a young age .
tr	2	" Daddy told me that someday a really nice man would come and I would go to live with him .
tr	3	The collar of the shirt , as usual , was turned up and brushed against the bottom of her short curly blonde hair .
tr	3	Scott 's gaze jetted to the calendar then up to the map that covered half of the wall of the office .
tr	2	A low throaty growl lifted Scott 's gaze to the door and he saw a silver coyote framed in the doorway .
tr	4	They hunted in the forest that covered most of the back half of the Lyndon land , never bothering neighbors or townsfolk .
tr	0	" Somehow he found out about Duke and he 's claiming that Duke is leading a pack of coyotes and attacking his cattle . "
tr	0	Josh Logan laughed outloud then grinned as he lifted his hat from her head and stuck it back on his own .
tr	4	The blonde gave the sheriff a kiss on the cheek , tossed a wave at Scott and Steve then disappeared out the door .
tr	3	" I think I 'll take a little ride south , " he gave them a wink then went out the door .
tr	0	" Oh shit , " he thought and his gaze rifled to the underbrush on the far side of the yard .
tr	3	Scott thought it only fair to warn the man even though it would serve him right to get confronted by the three animals .
tr	0	Jansen felt himself sliding down along the wedge that was holding him and he sank to his haunches as his gaze hit the ground .
tr	4	She gave her brother a small smile that melted the remaining anger from her expression before she sat down in the chair beside him .
tr	1	" I really am sorry Miss Lyndon , " Dan Jansen repeated , his gaze on the mound of fluffy fur in his lap .
tr	1	Dan Jansen sighed and nodded then looked down at the pup who was still sucking on a bottle that was now empty .
tr	4	" You see Jansen , " she said as she returned to the yard and stopped in the middle of the coyotes and bear .
tr	3	He looked at the man to see him watching the red blur that was moving up the distant slope at a fast pace .
tr	2	I would also like to thank the following for making this book possible : My mother , Shirley , for ... everything !
tr	3	Scott , for hashing out the intricacies involved and for trying to tear apart every theory I had and eliciting controversy at every turn .
tr	1	She could smell the biscuits , eggs , sausage , bacon , and gravy as soon as she opened her bedroom door .
tr	4	" But you 're a geeky video game nut -- you play video games sixteen hours a day sometimes ! "
tr	0	That means I 'm happy you enjoy what you 're doing and I 'll help any way I can ! "
tr	0	All Anna had known of her father was that he was black , which anyone could guess from her dark skin and kinky hair .
tr	0	As far as she was concerned , Rick was her dad now , and she was totally proud to be considered his daughter .
tr	4	She often called him Dad at home , but always ' Uncle Ricky ' in public -- because it embarrassed him .
tr	4	As he sat on the edge of her bed he chided , " You know , you 're almost fifteen .
tr	0	I pamper them too much , he thought , then smiled ; he wouldn 't have it any other way .
tr	4	Her short blonde hair framed a face with deep blue eyes and a spattering of freckles on her bony cheeks .
tr	0	She had straight thick black hair that hung just past her shoulders , which she kept tucked behind each ear .
tr	0	" Anderson 's going to have a pop quiz today , " Kaylie announced as they marched lock-step toward their first class .
tr	3	I think you have questions that are probably more interesting than facts about stuffy old farts in sheets , don 't you ? "
tr	1	" I want to know if the kids played sports , " she said easily as she marked through the question .
tr	0	Kaylie watched as the coach handed her co-captain a jersey , as well as most of the other starting players .
tr	3	With whistle in one hand and stopwatch in the other , she made eye contact with both captains and blew the whistle .
tr	4	The coach was pleased with the effort and told them to hit the showers , making the red team run a mile .
tr	2	And , uh , don 't you even know how you 're supposed to jump this ... Here , let me show you . "
tr	0	The coach was stunned again , " You 're not even arching your back -- can you try that ? "
tr	1	She carried it to the bike and laid it down while searching through her bag for something to wrap around it .
tr	4	They started with relays : girls in one lane , boys in the next , alternating for each age group .
tr	4	There were six girls in her age group today and six boys as well , so naturally they were racing .
tr	4	Now she had developed a slight trace of upper body muscles and was beginning to rise up from the depths of the team stats .
tr	3	" You had a fourth place finish just a week ago -- that 's two points , " Alex pointed out .
tr	2	As soon as she got most of the loose stuff off , she held it out for Alex to scrub .
tr	2	" It looks like one of those hologram cards , but those have angled surfaces , this is so smooth , " Jodie puzzled .
tr	2	" Well , I 'm battling Caesar 's army for some of my land right now -- " " Cool !
tr	3	Kaylie came down the stairs , flipped on the TV and sat down to brush the tangles out of her hair .
tr	2	You start cooking the rice and beans and I 'll go look for those books while I 'm thinking about it ! "
tr	1	" No , after the broccoli cooks , drain it and pour it in this dish , then mix all the other things in .
tr	0	I don 't know why she wanted beans with all this stuff , " he mumbled , shaking his head .
tr	1	This girl is wearing what looks like a grain sack cut open down the sides and tied at the waist .
tr	3	" Just because you both sit and read and talk about those history books and stuff together all the time .
tr	4	If you know any experts from the future , please , let me know and we 'll contact them . "
tr	1	" There 's some very strange math on it , too , Abby , as well as tons of writing and symbols . "
tr	2	" Nothing , just try not to call me dear in front of five curious , nosy girls again , OK ? "
tr	1	During the entire discussion , the kids had been passing the cube around , banging , poking , squeezing and even talking to it .
tr	2	" He 's on ; I 'm going to invite him to our chat ; he has no video . "
tr	3	" I don 't know , that 's why I didn 't mention it , but I noticed there are others by each entry .
tr	3	" Well ... " Walt paused for dramatic effect , " wait until you hear the translation of the ones I do understand ! "
tr	3	" It says , ' Time is critical ; follow the path ; the vortex is the key ' . "
tr	1	" Certainly , Walt , as long as you don 't show anyone unless we say it 's OK . "
tr	3	" What I mean is even the Bible is subject to thousands of different translations and interpretations for thousands of different sects .
tr	2	" Why don 't you go watch a movie and leave us dorks alone so we can think and figure it out ? "
tr	4	" I haven 't seen Abby in like a year , I thought maybe you broke up , " Kaylie said .
tr	3	We went to two digs with her last summer and back again to the second one just two months ago for spring break .
tr	3	He punched the third button on the wall to open the farthest door , housing the beastly old Dodge Caravan .
tr	1	" Don 't get near or touch it ; we don 't know what 's happening , " he warned .
tr	4	The object looked like a deep red crystal , about two inches long , shaped like a finely faceted teardrop .
tr	4	" It 's dated 1755 , " he read , " I wonder if that was when it was buried ? "
tr	4	" I should have guessed , " snickered Rick , " You know someone who does everything , don 't you ? "
tr	0	She quickly typed a message , " Rob , got a map for you -- it 's algebra , your favorite ! "
tr	4	" Algebra is just a joking way treasure hunters refer to maps where they have to ' find X ' . "
tr	1	In fact , if you find this one , I 'm almost positive Rick will part with that coin real quick . "
tr	3	" That 's what friends are for ... " " Tell Rick not to get his greasy fingerprints on my coin .
tr	2	He was dressed in what looked to be the consistency of aluminum foil , but obviously not stiff or metallic .
tr	1	" This is the precise location of the Earth Union Science Facilities of New Paris , built exactly thirty thousand years ago .
tr	0	" I think reality has just changed for all of us , " Abby said calmly , trying to comfort her .
tr	3	" Go to the last entry , Alex , then we 're turning this off and watching a movie , " Rick instructed .
tr	3	" He wanted it bad enough , so he got it ... but not before the blast of his pistol got me .
tr	2	But it 's not too late to develop a ... " He coughed , noticed it was blood he was coughing up and sighed .
tr	2	There 's so much you need to know but I 'm ... I 'm out of ... time , hah !
tr	4	It 's necessary to learn before you -- " He gasped , clutching his chest , barely recovering this time .
tr	0	Kaylie and Christy each rose next and placed a napkin in Rick and Abby 's laps before returning to their seats .
tr	0	Anna raised her hand as if she were in class and giggled , " Um , that 's my job ! "
tr	1	Please don 't be disappointed and don 't think you failed this morning -- this breakfast is totally incredible ! "
tr	3	" Why don 't we just drop Anna off at the track , she doesn 't want to go to the cave anyway ! "
tr	2	You girls don 't work so hard at these sports for us to not be there to support you . "
tr	3	I 'd like to learn about its history -- who set it up , who runs it and ... why ? "
tr	3	On the way , Alex took out the ' UC ' as they now called the Chronicler , and started to play with it .
tr	2	And use your cell phone to let me know if you 're getting out so I can watch you . "
tr	0	Alex asked the other girls , eventually giving him a list of drinks , candy , and nachos for Kaylie .
tr	1	It 'll be nice to see five blue ribbons today , " Rick said while chomping on a hot dog .
tr	2	A monotone voice could now be heard , " ... six , five , four , three , two , one . "
tr	0	In a flash of brilliance , accompanied by a rumble that shook the display , came a dart trailing fire into the sky .
tr	3	" Of course not , its next orbit around the sun will be in the third millennium BC , then the 76th .
tr	3	I do want to see it for myself but I can 't do anything about it now , can I ?
tr	1	" I guess it can wait , we have all the time in the world if this stuff is real , right ? "
tr	2	And Dr. Taylor almost got squashed by this one -- its toe was like the size of my whole body !
tr	4	We 're not talking about a circus or amusement park here ; we 're talking about something closer to running with the bulls .
tr	2	One is long jump and we should win all three places in that , so we basically can 't lose now . "
tr	4	" Then let 's go to the soccer field , " Kaylie decided suddenly , " since it 's over now . "
tr	0	" It 's not just a street -- it 's a major highway -- " " You 're paranoid , " she accused .
tr	3	Anna 's team won both of them and the coach motioned for the team to join him at the finish line .
tr	0	Rick backed up the video and paused it ; Anna had finished changing and came out from behind the seat .
tr	4	" That guy , " she indicated by touching his big nose , " Mr. Anderson , seventh grade history teacher .
tr	2	" I 've been waiting forever for you guys to show up so I could go get something to eat . "
tr	2	Just hold your nose then , Jessie ; I 'll roll a window down , too , " Rick joked .
tr	1	I want one of you in the back with Anna and one in the middle with Abby , who will be checking the map .
tr	3	" Anna , I want you to draw an arrow at each intersection to point back to the exit , OK ? "
tr	3	That drawing didn 't exactly match the maps , but this is definitely the area where it should be . "
tr	3	They both stuck out their tongues and gave a big raspberry , he calmly pointed to the bathroom , then left .
tr	3	As he tiptoed across the floor , she muttered without moving , " Please don 't disturb this burial site . "
tr	2	" Come on , I got plans for you , mummy , " he whispered softly , tugging at her arm .
tr	3	" Why don 't you head on down there and I 'll join you after I get that brat in the tub ? "
tr	4	He stood her by the tub , leaving her standing there , teetering , while he finished with the water .
tr	2	" Do you think you can get in on your own or do I have to throw you in ? "
tr	0	" Um , well ... " " Oh , " she said , almost embarrassed , " you and Abby ? "
tr	1	Rick splashed her , " OK , I 'm honored , now can we discuss it again when she 's 25 ? "
tr	0	Alex complained that she had to drain the tub because Anna had forgotten , and hopped in the bubbling , fragrant waters .
tr	3	" Yeah , that would be neat , honey , but I really don 't want you girls to get your hopes up .
tr	4	Wiping tears of mirth from his eyes he finally answered , " Kay , you wouldn 't have liked me at all then . "
tr	0	I 'd have to kick your butt now , while I can call it a spanking and not an assault ! "
tr	4	When he walked back into the kitchen , Abby was slumped at the kitchen counter with a cup of coffee .
tr	4	Christy , Jessica and Alex swarmed when they heard the kitchen door shut and immediately relieved him of the donut boxes .
tr	0	Jessica returned from her task , snickering , " I took a sandal and swatted Anna 's big fat booty ! "
tr	4	When the girls had heard the news of the secret passage , they demanded an immediate return to the cave .
tr	0	Anna was so excited that she ran to her room and came back carrying her shoes , still in her nightshirt .
tr	0	Each reluctantly picked up their donut as Rick and Abby packed their bags a bit lighter than the previous day .
tr	0	He rejoined his clan ; they had gradually crept toward the water and were also admiring the clarity and beauty .
tr	4	" The hot tub is 92 degrees , " Jessica stated factually as she continued to document every bit of the place .
tr	2	" Hold on , " he switched his light back on , " none of you are going in there . "
tr	3	" Don 't panic yet ; I 'm gon na go down like ten feet to test it out first .
tr	4	He tucked the bag into his shorts pocket so the light hung outside and immersed himself the rest of the way .
tr	2	he shot back casually , " I 'd hate for you to lose me before you finally admit you love me ! "
tr	0	Abby glared at him as he went under , and then turned to Kaylie , " What did that mean ? "
tr	4	He stood and pecked her lightly on the forehead , then squeezed the camera into his pocket and started back into the water .
tr	3	This was nearly the entire source of light in the room , but it wasn 't bright to look at .
tr	0	" Oh , he said you already told him no -- " " But that was two years ago ! "
tr	4	Jessica came right behind her , giving him little time to snag her under the arms and propel her on the way .
tr	3	Finally , he saw Abby 's foot lightly supporting her against the current at the split and hopped back in .
tr	4	Abby exclaimed as she broke the surface , then her elation turned to fascination as she saw into the room past his head .
tr	4	He grabbed the camera and took several pictures of the girls , capturing their complete bliss , overflowing with pride .
tr	0	A crack of lightning couldn 't have made them blink as Rick walked over to the machine , " Stay back , please . "
tr	2	I am not accustomed to crowds and it is much easier if you direct comments or questions to someone by name .
tr	3	" OK , that 's enough , T , " Rick interrupted and the display reset quickly back to 1941 .
tr	0	Any time you have an answer , I 'd like to hear it , T , " Rick said gladly .
tr	2	" First , as you now know , you choose a destination -- or time -- which you have done .
tr	1	" If you said New York City , " the display instantly changed , " you would get this view .
tr	1	" I can see you are having difficulty , so let 's get back to our introduction , Rick . "
tr	0	As Anna stepped cautiously into the bathroom , Kaylie perked up asked , " Can you make food , T ? "
tr	3	" Not really ... " " OK , let 's get to the important stuff , girls ... " Rick stopped them .
tr	3	Rick thought he sensed another hint of emotion in the answer though , as if she wanted to say more but couldn 't .
tr	3	Although the court thought , a witch she was not ; The first victim is seen with a diamond of green .
tr	0	" I am programmed to anticipate your needs , Rick , but I wouldn 't classify that as a poem .
tr	3	As they stared at the bright crystals , a portal opened in the top of the console and an arm containing four slots emerged .
tr	3	He wasn 't sure of his age , but that detail wasn 't important ; he wanted to find something else .
tr	3	" Yes , thanks , T. " He sat down and started to pour ketchup and add salt to his fries and burger .
tr	1	" I 'm rewinding it now , slower -- " The image was of Octavian walking through the street with guards all around him .
tr	4	The scene suddenly skipped to what appeared to be slightly earlier , where he was coming out of his home with the guards .
tr	4	He knew she had been studying the display carefully for some time and also wanted to assure her that he valued her opinion .
tr	4	" He 's always looking at himself in the mirror and he 's always either guarded heavily outside or surrounded by servants inside .
tr	4	All we have to do is cut the sides out of them and tie them together ... " " Who 's we ? "
tr	3	Christy took over , " Look , that 's 32 injuries out of over eight thousand trips , that 's like 0.4 % .
tr	3	" Honey , I hate to hurt your feelings , but I think you girls would only get in the way .
tr	0	she stared at him like a mother would stare at a child whose hand was still in the cookie jar .
tr	3	Think about it , Rick , you 'd let them go to Washington DC for a field trip , wouldn 't you ?
tr	4	" I feel like a thief , searching through people 's homes like this , " Alex admitted with a slightly scrunched up nose .
tr	0	" In those times it was often considered bad luck to disturb any belongings of a man while he was away at war .
tr	3	That wouldn 't give you much time to persuade her , and she probably wouldn 't part with it anyway , " Kaylie opined .
tr	4	Abby asked nervously " No , Abby , they will be gone only one minute and you must not interfere with their return . "
tr	3	" Would you like to put any time limits or any other restrictions on your journey at this time , Rick ? "
tr	4	In the distance , past the farm , they could see the edge of the city -- they were literally on its doorstep .
tr	2	" Yeah , me too , it 's so isolated , but so close to town ... " Kaylie agreed .
tr	4	He appeared to be about eleven years old or younger , but they knew he was fifteen from their research .
tr	2	" Well , we uh , well , we 're on foot -- " " Nobody would travel that road on foot !
tr	3	Alex decided to try to change the subject , " So how much is this tunic he 's fetching worth ? "
tr	3	She then turned to the girls , " He turns sixteen soon but still acts like a little girl sometimes .
tr	0	She had always acted tough , as if it were honorable for a girl to lose her daddy at war .
tr	3	He told her of the necklace and that it was to be given to Octavian today , but they did not know how .
tr	4	Alex asked specific questions about how they built their homes , what they were made of and how they cleaned them .
tr	4	" Go for it , " he replied and stole a glance down the street in anticipation of the future emperor .
tr	3	The captain appraised Rick thoroughly , finally concluding , " The daughter of a veteran in the famous fighting Thirteenth Legion ?
tr	2	" I know , but if you don 't , I won 't be able to run or even walk ! "
tr	4	He was glad her body blocked the view of his leg and he didn 't dare risk a glance at his shoulder .
tr	1	Rick half hopped , half limped , following Christy , with Kaylie and Alex at his side , helping him stay upright .
tr	4	Christy quickly led them to the main road where they hid behind a display while Kaylie doubled back to purchase some cloth .
tr	1	She probably didn 't even know it was stolen ; she was just as innocent as you , dear . "
tr	1	Rick nodded , and then reconsidered , " Wait , " he said , fumbling in his pouch for something .
tr	0	All Rick saw was a white blur and the back of her tunic trailing behind her like a comet tail .
tr	0	The tunic was ripped in more places than it had places , but she was happy as a pig in mud .
tr	4	" One minute , " Abby sarcastically replied , " I just hope they come back with all their fingers . "
tr	4	Abby rushed to the lockers and located the medical kit while the girls went to change back into their normal clothes .
tr	4	he explained very coolly , calmly , betraying his own fears only by the way his hand clutched his wounded leg .
tr	3	It took all his strength to get to his feet and walk to the bathroom door and knock at the partially open door .
tr	0	All sitting around the table , Rick asked , " OK , let 's make a plan , what do you all think ?
tr	4	" Only a couple that mention it ... how the colonies and government were formed and became the United States . "
tr	1	" And you are certainly not in any condition to do anything but go to bed tonight , " Kaylie challenged .
tr	0	Jessica leapt out of her seat and bounced around her , finally stopping long enough grab Abby in a huge hug .
tr	3	" No , Rick , it simply changes the molecular state of the objects you place into it to air .
tr	3	She certainly isn 't alive this day , but I need a specific date to answer that to your satisfaction . "
tr	4	" Kaylie , let 's get back to the most important problems now -- like how are we getting out of here ? "
tr	2	" That sounds like a good thing for you to do when we get home , " he told Jessica .
tr	2	I 'd break both my arms to save one of you , don 't you worry a bit about that .
tr	2	Let 's print it all out , you go lay down and I 'll sit on the bed beside you and read it all .
tr	4	He printed out all the information he had found , and grabbed it as Abby headed to check on the kids .
tr	3	Most startling of all his revelations was that it really had turned out to be the key to a time machine .
tr	2	Abby was shopping for supplies for her upcoming expedition and didn 't come home until it was almost time to get Jessica from school .
tr	4	Some say he was born in Jerusalem , some in Jericho , some in Nazareth , some even say Mary wasn 't his mother !
tr	1	She fits the profile , Scott : four years as a programmer for the DOD , fired for insubordination last September .
tr	4	He marveled at the carefully groomed lawn and shrubbery , imagining the time it must take to maintain the manicured look .
tr	2	His last two movies grossed $ 3.8 billion , more than the total of all other movies for the previous four years .
tr	0	What started as entertainment for his daughters evolved into a coping mechanism to maintain his sanity as he waged a monumental battle against injustice .
tr	3	The monstrous figure strode forward , toward Margaret - the last remnant of its long , dragon tail shrinking away into its backside .
tr	0	Margaret screamed again and clawed at the arm holding her - but her nails might as well have been digging at stone .
tr	1	The giant looked her up and down , taking in her skinny , vegetarian 's body and her manly haircut .
tr	1	A Christian fish , like Josie had seen countless times on the trunk lids and bumpers of cars around town .
tr	0	Nearly a flash flood , the rain had washed all the ash and soot off the stone corpse in a very short time .
tr	4	The man 's stone chest was whole , his head a bald , smooth surface with no sign it had ever been broken apart .
tr	4	CHAPTER TWO After a long , wet , treacherous ride , Josie and her friends had made it back to their campsite .
tr	3	The man held the can to his lips and tilted his head back , trying to drain the precious moisture out .
tr	3	The man dropped the empty bottle from his right hand and started to raise the bottle in his left to his lips .
tr	1	Carlos , Kendall , Jimmy and Logan all started in their tents - kicking off blankets and being generally disoriented .
tr	4	Not at the knife sticking out of the stranger 's back , but at the nickel-plated revolver Carlos had produced from somewhere .
tr	3	Not because the stranger was still standing after being shot six times , but because of what was happening to him now .
tr	3	" To be honest , " the stranger , Mark , smiled , " I had to think about that . "
tr	0	" Seriously , man , " Carlos asked , not ready to give up , " What 's your stage name ? "
tr	4	Josie stepped behind Mark and grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler - one of only a few left .
tr	0	" I was thinking more of a payphone , " Mark said , wondering what the thing in Carlos ' hand was .
tr	4	" That makes sense - if he regenerated tissue , the neural patterns left by experiences wouldn 't be there . "
tr	4	For him to have fought in Korea would mean he was born long before their parents - maybe even their grandparents .
tr	0	Maria quickly changed the subject - putting a small box on the table she had pulled from a pocket of her lab coat .
tr	1	He opened it - inside was a gold necklace , with a small , gold Christian fish pendant on it .
tr	3	She was interrupted by the ringing of a red phone , on a stand by the front door to the apartment .
tr	3	Of all the accidents that could happen on this project , this was at the top of the her list of the worst possible .
tr	2	The hallway itself was plain - a drop panel ceiling with fluorescent lights and vents , hanging over a simple tiled floor .
tr	0	" Oh , crap , " Mark said as the grenade bounced and rolled across the floor , back toward him .
tr	4	Only a dozen feet away from Mark , the grenade detonated - releasing a cloud of fire and molten metal .
tr	4	Maria ripped the fire extinguisher from the wall and fumbled with the safety pin while her husband slowly burned to death .
tr	0	On the back of Kendall 's truck , Logan started to laugh - which caused him pain that made him wince .
tr	4	Mark stepped over to join them just as Josie turned the item over in her hand for a better look .
tr	2	" So , you can come back from the dead , you 're bullet-proof , super strong and you can nullify magic ? "
tr	4	" Well , what did you do , after the war , but before you remember dying in 1962 ? "
tr	4	Jimmy asked , hoping Mark could talk some sense into Josie and they 'd finally be rid of the stranger .
tr	3	He had taken the drive to the highway then driven straight to the nearest town and its small police station .
tr	0	A man in a black suit , with sunglasses and an ear piece , had come in and started silently watching over them .
tr	2	When World War II broke out , Mark was too young to fight - but watched as his older brothers went off to fight .
tr	3	The first small town - little more than a gas station and a dozen other buildings - Josie made Jimmy pull over .
tr	2	Once again , Jimmy got out on the driver 's side , while Josie followed Mark out the front passenger door .
tr	3	Jimmy wasn 't the expert on the subject that Carlos was , but he decided to give it a try .
tr	1	Hailing from California , the Sentinel had been capable of flying , lifting cars over his head and appeared impervious to injury .
tr	3	Before Cletus could even start his swing , Mark pivoted slightly on his right foot and his left leg shot out .
tr	3	The ball of his left foot smashed into Cletus stomach - right over the gigantic belt buckle he had under his untucked shirt .
tr	4	" Make sure you get that window fixed , " he said loud enough for the other locals to hear .
tr	4	CHAPTER EIGHT Across the country , the report of Mark 's brief skirmish with Pete and Cletus was being analyzed .
tr	2	Large , seventy-two inch monitors hung on the walls of the command post , displaying information from around the world .
tr	1	She swiftly went around the store , picking out several shirts , some pants and finally a pair of white tennis shoes .
tr	3	CHAPTER NINE The Mall 's food court was bustling with activity - most of it younger people in their teens and twenties .
tr	1	In under a minute , it was just Josie , Mark , an unconscious Jimmy and twelve men in black .
tr	0	" Only if you try and hug me , " Mark said , turning and walking toward the truck again .
tr	3	Stepping forward quickly , with the unconscious Jimmy still on his shoulder , Mark closed the distance to the last agent .
tr	0	Bennett dropped to all fours , coughing and hacking , and growing faint from pain and the lack of breathable air .
tr	0	Standing across the parking lot lane from Jimmy 's truck , on top of a parked car , was a woman all in black .
tr	4	The woman in black dropped her steel cable and pulled a short , polished , ebony cane from her jacket .
tr	0	His hair was gone from the top of his head to the back of his neck , but his skin was unburned .
tr	3	His shirt was burnt the rest of the way off , the ashes of it falling down as the stream of fire went out .
tr	4	First the target didn 't know who she was , now he resisted some of her most powerful , most used , magic .
tr	3	The many ice shards sticking out of the target began to fall off him , as though they were melting .
tr	0	She reared back with both hands on her magical cane , ready to bash Mark 's head in with the large , mystical ruby .
tr	0	" My recommendation is that we follow him - at a safe distance - and see what happens , " Campbell said .
tr	0	I have the ghost walkers scouring the region , " Campbell finally said when it was his turn to talk again .
tr	2	When he looked back up at the road , Jimmy realized he wasn 't looking across the hood of his truck anymore .
tr	0	" Couple that with a telepathic handler and you have a spy that can circle the globe and relay real-time information . "
tr	3	A string of twenty-three more bodies , all with their hearts ripped out , but with no connection to each other .
tr	0	Truth was something Echo had grown up with - no one being able to hide their thoughts , or lies , from him .
tr	2	Echo nodded , and carefully walked away from the room , staggering , but not too much , back across the parking lot .
tr	2	A high school dropout who had run away from uncaring parents , hoping she could make it to Hollywood and become a star .
tr	3	The body of the target jumped and twitched as small streams of heat , the 7.62 mm bullets , tore into it .
tr	2	The leap from her horizontal , reclined position was instantaneous and brought her on top of Atlas in a split second .
tr	4	The stone soldier sailed a good ten feet through the air before hitting the ground and rolling several times to a stop .
tr	4	Their inhuman strength and stone physiques made them lethal to normal people , but the stone soldiers weren 't made for fighting normal people .
tr	0	Originally made with a shoulder stock and a long barrel for accuracy , the gun lobbed 40mm grenades , one shot at a time .
tr	0	Simultaneously , Hyperion crashed through the rear room of the motel , smashing through the wall into the shapeshifter 's room .
tr	1	His hail of lead ripped into the truck driver , passing through and glancing off Hyperion 's stone body harmlessly .
tr	4	The stream of bullets reduced first the face , then the head of the shapeshifter to broken pulp in only a few seconds .
tr	4	She twisted quickly , pulling herself off the Bowie knife as she ducked over , pulling Hyperion off his feet .
tr	3	The impact was sufficient to crush the shapeshifter 's rib cage and knock it off its feet and send it flying backwards .
tr	3	He had tried to radio for backup , but he wasn 't familiar with the transmitters the squad had been using .
tr	0	The shapeshifter shook the body , back and forth , like a dog with a toy , snapping Echo 's neck .
tr	3	The shapeshifter dropped the corpse to the ground , then pounced on it with both paws , and bit into the chest .
tr	4	The dragon remained motionless for many seconds , absorbing the heart , the power of the telepath into its own being .
tr	3	" I remember a little bit about my mission , but between 1962 and then is still a bit blurry . "
tr	2	" Getting your head blown off , your heart ripped out , then burned to a crisp doesn 't sound lucky to me ! "
tr	4	As soon as you deliver your message , they 're going to spirit you away somewhere safe where they can start questioning you .
tr	0	The agent , or rather , the shapeshifter , had just punched through Franks ' back , severing his spinal column .
tr	1	Underneath the bullets and flying brass casings coming out of their pistols , Josie scrambled backwards , on her hands and heels .
tr	2	Unfortunately , of his thousands upon thousands of years of life , only forty of them had been spent awake .
tr	4	This they placed in his greatest temple , as a warning to any other who dared to rule over them .
tr	3	Guests of the hotel had fled - some through side exits back into the hotel , some out to the parking lot .
tr	1	Only the barest shreds of a suit clung to his shoulders , while his slacks were torn and stretched , barely containing him .
tr	4	They ran up to the side of the hotel , watching the rampage of dragon and super soldier from a safer distance .
tr	4	The axe head , designed for chopping through steel doors in an emergency , cleaved skin and bone , burying itself to the handle .
tr	4	The agent landed hard at Josie 's feet , his gun clattering out of a broken hand and onto the concrete by her feet .
tr	1	But instead of being a whole giant , the shapeshifter still had a gaping hole in his chest , blood pouring out .
tr	3	He felt a round shatter his double row of front teeth , rip through his tongue and into his throat .
tr	4	All she could remember was him clinging to the shapeshifter 's leg in the elevator , telling her to run .
tr	0	His gray shirt was bloody , torn open , with a gaping hole in his chest where the shapeshifter had ripped out his heart .
tr	3	Small , brown , with mangy fur , the hungry canine trotted along the road that ran past the hotel .
tr	1	It passed small scrub brushes , its nose going back and forth from sniffing the air , to sniffing the ground .
tr	3	It wasn 't a black agent 's suit , but rather something Josie thought her mom would wear to a job interview .
tr	3	The helicopter circled a lone , black office building , about twenty stories tall , that sat overlooking a bay .
tr	2	The elevator finally stopped , the doors opening on rich marble floors in what looked like an ordinary office building .
tr	4	Beyond the door , there was a vast chamber , nearly three stories high and over a hundred feet across .
tr	0	SHADES OF WAR Someone is raising the spirits of the dead from American battlefields - forming a dark army to attack the living .
tr	2	" You should get something to eat , " said HS2 , " or perhaps I should buy you a drink ? "
tr	1	He was still trim , in shape from regular workouts , with just a dusting of grey hair beginning at his temples .
tr	1	It went on and on ... Victoria 's interest in implanting a bio memory in Toby 's brain intrigued William .
tr	0	" Ron , " said Victoria , " it 's been a long day and we should wrap this up .
tr	4	If this works , his social development will advance rapidly , and he ' ll need you more than ever . "
tr	1	" I 'm really not sure I like that , and I didn 't realize it would be possible . "
tr	0	" His lab is a fascinating place , he took us there Saturday , and I want to go back now . "
tr	3	" I 'm going to William 's study , at least some of him is there , " Toby shouted .
tr	1	Victoria watched Toby trudge off toward the study , restraining herself from disciplining him , another new part of his life .
tr	4	There was a catch ; everyone was expected to supply two pieces of information per month related to their part of the world .
tr	1	Simply knowing which checkout lines were moving the quickest in a store justified giving permission to the device to time the transaction automatically .
tr	1	" He is working on sensor inputs and logic programs today and he has one meeting scheduled in the afternoon .
tr	4	" Victoria , " said Alfred , " I know you were the one person in the world he trusted completely .
tr	2	Even today , I have no reservations about you or the firm , I hope you hold none against me . "
tr	4	We both needed that change of scenery on Saturday , but now he 's begging more than ever to spend time with you .
tr	4	" Two weeks ago he couldn 't even remember my name and he never would have remembered a trip to your lab from Saturday .
tr	1	William had even given him an artificial respiration , matched to his level of physical activity , which was obvious even to casual observers .
tr	1	" I can deliver the electronic to bio organism cloning system for an additional sum , equal to the first . "
tr	1	William sat back in his chair , considering the obvious logical conclusion , which he had overlooked , but Toby had realized so quickly .
tr	2	Of course you can learn a lot from your mother 's writing too , " said William holding up his hands in surrender .
tr	0	" Victoria can be sarcastic and didn 't like consulting , which must have made her father sad , " said Toby .
tr	0	Doing so was a bit strange , not exactly like issuing a command , which he knew from the manuals .
tr	1	Victoria thinks I can do something with the rest of this implant , William was just happy with me using the memory .
tr	1	If this is William 's lab , maybe I can find him ... I have the mesh network connections guide .
tr	2	Toby could now plainly see William 's face close enough to touch , but he obviously wasn 't in the room with him .
tr	1	A large aging man wearing a shiny black suit was sitting at the receiving desk display , looking intently into Toby 's face .
tr	0	" 007 , that 's called brown nosing and it was a feeble attempt at that , " said Alfred chuckling .
tr	2	" Right ... If William only knew what Alfred has planned -- I know him too well -- he would scuttle the project .
tr	2	William is a patriot through and through , he would never knowingly allow his work to be sold to terrorists . "
tr	4	Toby should have been able to see and hear everything 007 was sensing , and many of his internal commands .
tr	0	Jacob was excited , and she was happy for him , proud of all his achievements , but scared for Toby .
tr	0	" We haven 't lived normal lives for months , " said Jacob , " and I may never lead a normal life again .
tr	2	He 'd only known Toby for a little over two months ; she needed to stay away from this subject for now .
tr	3	" I suppose it 's a logical step if you consider that it would be easier to test that way .
tr	1	Each individual sensor joins the network , identifies itself -- like , I 'm the right elbow -- and reports motion .
tr	3	" You will learn all you can from this , master Toby , and with that attitude it will be . "
tr	2	" You don 't know me Toby , but I know Victoria and William , and many of the people at NET . "
tr	2	Jacob said , " Yes you do , and I 'm proud of you for thinking that , and for telling me .
tr	4	I can 't remember where , but I have seen your face on the mesh network with one word : Deceased .
tr	4	You can help us stop them from selling 007 to bad people , and let William complete his projects . "
tr	1	Victoria walked apprehensively into the study and gently sat beside Toby on the sofa , giving him a smile , holding his hand .
tr	3	" Well , " said Jacob , letting out a long sigh , " that 's worse than I thought .
tr	3	" I know 007 tries to be funny , but it didn 't occur to him that I 'm brain damaged too .
tr	1	" I 'd like to try talking to William through 007 , " said Toby a twinkle in his eye .
tr	4	I accept the terms , provided you can demonstrate the clone process to my team and provide the resources for one additional clone . "
tr	4	Her eyes were slightly bloodshot and swollen , as if she 'd been crying , although she could only be described as glowing .
tr	1	Toby was giggling and there , standing behind him , in the flesh and chortling with delight , was Jacob Crawford .
tr	0	" We 'll see each other again soon , young man , " said Jacob patting him on the back .
tr	3	Victoria , expecting Toby to fight going to bed , took his hand and quickly swung him toward the hall .
tr	0	Jacob stood , sensed William 's appraising gaze , held his arms out and said , " I 've changed a few things .
tr	3	I can tell you with utmost certainty , there is good reason for all this and there was no other way .
tr	0	William took Jacob 's glass and poured them each another round , returning Jacob 's glass then retreating to the sofa .
tr	2	Presumably Alfred thought I was in the lobby , as the limo driver had undoubtedly reported , and Victoria had somehow found out .
tr	4	He said he was relieved to hear from her , that he had been notified of the bombing , then momentarily became speechless .
tr	4	After a few moments he raised his empty hand expecting to see his glass , then returned soberly to the chair .
tr	3	" We both thought it would be the best way to put an end to this , " said Jacob .
tr	4	Jacob turned on a blender , which produced a green slurry in short order , and then divided the results among three glasses .
tr	3	" We thought , " said Victoria , " that we might as well let Toby take this as far as he can .
tr	1	" I think there will be more interest in harvesting Toby 's organism than kidnapping and brainwashing him , " Victoria said solemnly .
tr	1	" Now I 'm sober , " William said , his eyes closed , massaging his temples with both hands .
tr	3	" The best thing we can do , " said Jacob , " is step it up a few notches with Toby .
tr	1	His potential to connect to hundreds of sensors through the mesh nets and the HS units makes him his own best security guard . "
tr	3	In practically a whisper , 007 said , " Please don 't worry , Toby is a wonderful host and quite trustworthy .
tr	3	Not readily apparent were the thousands of sensors tracking all activities within the walls , right down to the pulse of each inhabitant .
tr	1	It 's nothing I can put my finger on exactly ... sometimes I guess I 'm afraid he can read my mind . "
tr	4	007 observed and reacted intelligently to all the inputs of the physical world surrounding him , a complex feat humans take for granted .
tr	2	I 'll stop by and you can tell me how you pulled this one off , William , " said Ben .
tr	2	Surprisingly , most of it 's in operational or documenting operation of either the HS units or your proprietary network protocols .
tr	0	Everything we 've manufactured so far has a known limit , but the organisms are simulating natural neural networks . "
tr	2	" Ok , let 's get back to how you made this work so quickly , Toby , " said William .
tr	4	It really only needs a host memory , and it will accept inputs and cascade through the logic gates much like a neural network .
tr	3	" Toby , it 's time to sign off ... Wait , on second thought , stay here and stay neutral .
tr	4	007 was broadcasting a message that Alfred 's pulse and blood pressure where both at elevated levels , but seemed to be stabilizing .
tr	0	" It 's apparent , " said Jacob , " that Alfred was somehow tied up with an Indonesian terrorist group .
tr	3	Relative to most attacks , the hotel was almost undamaged -- just the lobby desk area where I was to be standing .
tr	4	Several of the elderly who were still coherent felt they were contributing to research in the best way they could .
tr	4	They had been in every room in the house , and in several areas outside and in Victoria 's car .
tr	2	He 'll be a dual boot , and I don 't want anyone outside of Ben , Toby and Victoria to know about this .
tr	1	Execute the plan I gave you and remain in surveillance mode in all interactions until I talk with you again . "
tr	2	William motioned for Mac to follow him into the next room , which was a small , barren conference room .
tr	0	And the deal is the same as before , plus an extra 20 grand to make it a wearable mask .
tr	0	" I can make a mask , but you 're not paying this much for the job , you 're paying for privacy . "
tr	0	" And so he shall be known , " said William , loud and clear , " presuming his dual personality has some character .
tr	2	" I can hear you just fine , you don 't need to shout , " said Toby over the host connection .
tr	3	Slipping into the restroom , 007 took time to glance to his right at his reflection in the mirror over the marble vanity .
tr	2	That made him a poor choice for the mission of maintaining a connection to the Eye planted in the washroom .
tr	0	" Why thank you , 007 , " said Victoria , who looked stunning in her red dress and high heels .
tr	2	" He looks exactly like me , " said Toby , looking back and forth between 006 and his own body .
tr	2	" Yes , " said Alfred , " Well , let 's talk while we walk to the lower level lab , shall we ?
tr	1	" I 've always handled the funding on my own , and ... I don 't know this group too well . "
tr	0	Why did you ... " " Other than the news reports , I know nothing of the ordeal with her father , Dr. Harland .
tr	0	Ahmad turned to Tom and Jerry and spoke a curt series of commands in a language Alfred did not recognize .
tr	2	" You 're right , " said Jacob , " but I don 't think it could be Ahmad or Bob . "
tr	2	" The other two were probably checking out our security systems somehow , and now they 're doing who knows what . "
tr	4	006 , wearing a black tuxedo , the mask and colored eye lenses from Mac , was Toby 's twin .
tr	3	Satisfied he had control of the HS , he directed the unit to the front parking lot through the facility map .
tr	3	Toby directed 006 to turn , stumble for effect , then catch himself and run into the setting sun across the parking lot .
tr	3	Toby could hear the Asians ' footsteps running toward 006 , he directed the HS to turn and look at them .
tr	0	Mohammed took a small case from the trunk , said something to Mohan , and returned to the building as the car pulled away .
tr	1	" I 'm going to retrieve the HS and my researchers , " Alfred said , addressing his visitors across the hall .
tr	1	Toby was scared into leaving the building without one of the adults ; clearly something had gone wrong in William 's lab .
tr	3	Alfred turned the corner to the lobby , deep in thought , and almost ran into Tom -- or was it Jerry ?
tr	0	" We always have choices , Dr. Harland , and you have had many choices throughout our negotiations thus far .
tr	2	" Toby , " said Jacob , " Victoria and I are going to the lower level to handle our other two visitors .
tr	1	" I 'm going to find out what was in that briefcase Mohammed brought into the building , " said William .
tr	4	007 kicked the silenced pistol to the wall , then placed his hand around Alfred 's wrist , feeling for a pulse .
tr	3	" Come on , it 's time to put your driving skills into practice , and what better time could there be ?
tr	4	He could erase the recordings , but the security database tracing of their whereabouts took time to access and clean up .
tr	0	I 'm not sure what Victoria and Jacob know about Ahmad , but they can handle those two for a while .
tr	3	We should be able to get right up to the hanger ; I just dropped my identity into the airport gate security database .
tr	0	Alfred had been an accomplished and admired leader , and a close friend to many , but that was years ago .
tr	3	" I 'm going to retrieve the case and try to scan it again in the back parking lot . "
tr	2	" Take one step out of this room and you 're leaving here in a body bag , " Jacob shouted .
tr	4	Either the man knew no English or was in shock , but clearly he understood the intent of Jacob 's aggression .
tr	3	Your other friend has returned to the airport , with a worthless robot , and even that is being returned to us now .
tr	3	" It 's nice you 're being honest , " said Jacob , " but admitting that is not going to help you . "
tr	0	" Toby can stay in the lab , he can direct a search , but 007 should be able to track Ahmad down . "
tr	2	Toby had placed 006 , who still looked like his twin brother , strategically in the middle of the lobby .
tr	3	They heard Ahmad stumble out of the stairwell into the dark lobby and stop , apparently orienting himself to the room .
tr	1	In addition to monitoring and influencing William 's research remotely , Jacob devised a plan to regain control over his research .
tr	4	As expected , he was advised to trust the bureau and disclose the full nature of the situation , enlisting their help .
tr	3	A month of negotiations later , the FBI was salivating at the thought of obtaining this technology and its primary creators .

tr	1	It 's a very rural country with -- " " You told me , Mom , " her son interrupted .
tr	0	As he watched the sheep , David realized that Sarah 's idea to visit a remote part of Ireland was a good one .
tr	3	John was able to get Sponge Bob Square Pants on the TV but was told he couldn 't watch his first night in Ireland .
tr	3	The three of them bundled up in jackets and a quilt and sat outside under the stars talking and identifying constellations .
tr	0	" But Dad -- " " Just hang tight , John , " Sarah said , groping for her iPhone on the side table .
tr	0	An hour later , the rain had stopped and David and Sarah sat on the front steps of the cottage .
tr	1	" And I tried to call the American embassy in Dublin , " he said , pulling out his cell phone .
tr	1	All of a sudden a bright flash appeared in the sky , turning the horizon briefly white with its intensity .
tr	0	They all got into the small rental car , buckled up and then sat in the driveway facing the main road .
tr	1	The frustration of no news -- of not being able to do anything while death and destruction dismantled their country -- was an agony .
tr	1	" Wait for us , John , " she called , hurrying to catch up with him and leaving David to his private reflections .
tr	3	Later that afternoon , stuffed with mutton and potatoes , they collected their purchases from Siobhan 's store and made the long walk home .
tr	0	" I can 't imagine what 's happening at home , " Sarah said , shivering in her heavy sweater .
tr	2	" And you stay out of the way so you don 't get kicked , " she said to John .
tr	3	But however it went down it still adds up to the Americans being the ones at the center of this disaster . "
tr	0	Sarah stared at him , the will to fight left her as the realization of what he was saying began to sink in .
tr	3	That night they ate salted baked potatoes without butter and canned meat from the root cellar that looked and tasted like shredded Spam .
tr	2	" If no one comes for us , we 'll get out and back home on our own somehow . "
tr	0	Mack Finn sat in a plastic lawn chair outside the broken down caravan , a small pile of cigarette butts at his feet .
tr	4	Every once in awhile he called out to ask her how to get his mount to do what he needed it to .
tr	3	With that , he nudged the pony into a trot on the dirt road to ride next to his dad .
tr	1	" I 'm Sarah Woodson , " she said , " and this is my husband David and our son John . "
tr	4	The woman ushered Sarah into her cottage , a miserable looking hovel from the outside , but surprisingly warm and cozy on the inside .
tr	2	" Yes , but if you don 't know what it is you have to do , how can you do it ? "
tr	4	" Now you 'll not wanting to be insulting me before we 've had a chance to get to know each other . "
tr	3	" Stop acting the maggot , " Finn snarled , ratcheting the rope tighter around the younger man 's wrist .
tr	4	He strutted to the center of the group gathered around a small cook fire and dragged the younger man behind him .
tr	4	" Wait here while I put these two to bed then I 'll come back for big Dan there . "
tr	0	" I 'm making bread , " Sarah said as she picked up the jar of starter and peered at it .
tr	3	That seemed to satisfy him so she set about lighting the gas stove and putting two of the precious eggs in an iron skillet .
tr	3	She thought of the disappointment on John 's face if she had to tell him tonight that there was no bread .
tr	1	" We 'll find him , Sarah , " David called after her , the panic and fear in his voice belying his words .
tr	0	She was angry and afraid , a combination of which she had felt pretty much nonstop since the crisis had happened .
tr	2	The thought comforted her and she walked on , pushing thoughts of crumpled little boy forms and wild dogs from her mind .
tr	3	" But I just thought we should get all the stuff that 's ours in one spot , you know ? "
tr	3	" You assume God made the rabbit for us to eat because that 's what you want to do to it .
tr	2	That 's what you call ... " He looked out the window as if looking for the word out there .
tr	4	Sarah finished cleaning the dishes and joined the other two who were talking seriously , their respective handiwork of tack and tools ignored .
tr	1	" I mean , I know Seamus says it 's ' cause they 're stupid -- " " You got Seamus to talk ? "
tr	3	Anyway , he was trying to get to that old deer salt lick and didn 't think things through , you know ? "
tr	2	One of his cows was found , dead , too far from Iain 's place , and someone went to check on Iain . "
tr	3	They were all , finally , at the point where they didn 't mind the taste of the goat milk in their tea .
tr	4	After a paragraph of what could only be considered serious whining , Sarah crumpled up the letter and started over .
tr	0	Sarah put the dishes in the sink and punched down the dough for the bread she was planning for lunch .
tr	3	Something 's got at ' em , " John said , his eyes wild and darting from parent to parent .
tr	3	He stared up into the autumn night sky and saw the stars so clearly he thought for a minute he must be hallucinating .
tr	0	" Eat fast , " Sarah said when he 'd peeled off his jacket and sat down to his breakfast .
tr	0	She was halfway to the pasture before she 'd realized she was wearing only a thick wool knitted cap for protection against a fall .
tr	2	" Mom , " John sounded like he was world-weary having to explain something so basic as his reasoning to her .
tr	1	Might not even need to use force at first , he thought , laying down his winning hand on the table .
tr	0	David 's grandfather used to tell David that when he was a boy he always said " no " to one thing every day .
tr	4	With John , he had created a movable chicken pen that allowed the birds to spend every day on a fresh patch of grass .
tr	2	On the days that David was gone , John could hook it up to his pony and move it by himself .
tr	3	She kept the cottage spotless -- not easy to do with so much of their lives happening outside in the dirt and the wind .
tr	3	There was snow on the ground this morning and Sarah was glad that David had not tried to come home the night before .
tr	0	His own folks had passed nearly a decade ago -- the tragic victims of a drunk driver on a country road .
tr	3	Assuming she 'd already pretty much botched that tactic , Sarah took a moment to try to calm her nerves .
tr	2	She looked out the kitchen window with the hope that she 'd catch a glimpse of David coming down the main road on Rocky .
tr	3	They kept milk bottles parked out on the porch all night but meat couldn 't be left out without attracting animals .
tr	4	CHAPTER ELEVEN Three men stood with their backs to her in the courtyard between the house and the barn facing the barn front .
tr	3	Not caring that they could see what she was doing , Sarah dug into her pocket and fished out a third round .
tr	0	" Yeah , Michael , wake up , you stupid sod , " John said , nudging the man with the shovel .
tr	0	" That is a good idea , John , " Sarah said , wondering from where he got his acting talent .
tr	0	" It 's a minor wound , " the man blurted , his eyes darting back and forth from Sarah to John .
tr	0	Suddenly , without warning , he wheeled on John who had walked too close to him and snatched him up .
tr	4	Afterward , she would remember John lurching away from the falling corpse , blood sprayed across the back of his jacket .
tr	0	He ... he -- " All of a sudden , Sarah got an image of the chicken in the burlap bag .
tr	1	Finn 's pain mirrored his anger , climbing in arcs of intensity higher and higher , until he felt nearly incapable of speech .
tr	4	By the time he and Georgie had limped back to camp , he was delirious with pain and thoughts of revenge .
tr	4	" Look , Sarah ... " He reached out a hand to touch her but she pulled away , refusing to be mollified .
tr	0	Sarah wondered , as she rode away from the cottage , waving to her son and husband , what that might look like .
tr	2	" If I could have your attention , " he bellowed to the forty or so people milling about the wagon .
tr	2	I 'm a fisherman and most of you know me for that but some of you also know me as a good neighbor .
tr	1	" It 's Mike , and no , we have sheds and barns and strong backs to help those that can build houses . "
tr	4	She had even fed her horse and released him back into the pasture before allowing a friend to drive her to the hospital .
tr	3	It was about that time that she met David and decided the courtship didn 't allow time to include horses too .
tr	4	Her own horse back home , no bigger than a large polo pony , had been as docile and sweet as a golden retriever .
tr	0	Yet Sarah had virtually given the mare away and had breathed a sigh of relief as if she had unloaded a demon on wheels .
tr	3	Pretty hard to steal a pony trap with the pony attached , she thought , as she slid to the ground from her saddle .
tr	0	The woman who sold it to her had just lost her son but Sarah had not had the nerve to ask how .
tr	0	" I 'll ask my husband , " she said to the woman who sat , wringing a wet rag in her hands .
tr	2	" What with losing my Jamie , I don 't know how to thank you -- " " The cow , " Sarah said .
tr	0	Not more than a few days , probably just a day , him being American and so clever and all . "
tr	3	An hour later , Sarah stood next to her horse on the small rise and watched the front of the old stone cottage .
tr	4	She counted on her horse reacting first to any unseen threat in the forecourt or the perimeter of the cottage .
tr	1	The younger man came closer , not taking his eyes off the gun in her hand but absent-mindedly patting Dan on the neck .
tr	4	It was almost like he 'd seen the episode on the porch he 'd just experienced in a movie or something .
tr	3	It was enough to stay upright on the horse -- she was so tired -- without trying to figure which road to take .
tr	4	It 's hard work but we 're healthy , we 're ( relatively ) warm , and we have enough to eat .
tr	4	Seems the Irish considered the wine in the " essential things " category and I did very well in my trading !
tr	0	So , this is a long way of saying that David left this morning for a week away from us .
tr	1	As hard as it is here , it 's a lot harder when 50 % of your workforce is gone !
tr	4	She wondered where David was sleeping tonight , she hoped he did better than the barn or shed at Julie 's place .
tr	1	" Morning , sweetie , " she said as she mixed precious sugar and goat milk into a mug for him .
tr	3	She slid the biscuits in the stove and sat down at the kitchen table with her own mug of tea .
tr	0	She wasn 't friendly and Sarah worried that she saw the woman looking around , taking inventory of the cottage and barn .
tr	0	The rabbit traps had been empty for several days now and Sarah doubted they 'd catch any more until spring .
tr	3	It was when David had been gone a total of two weeks that John began to push to go after him .
tr	0	" God has given us a full plate and it 's all that we can do to handle this . "
tr	2	" I think God 's wondering how long it 'll take before we get up and go look for him .
tr	4	It wouldn 't have mattered if she hadn 't been lost in her thoughts when the sound of the thunder crashed down on them .
tr	0	" He ... I ... I think he fell , " she said , hoping he wouldn 't kill her .
tr	4	When she saw how badly Dan was limping as John led him over , she realized it didn 't matter .
tr	3	It never occurred to Sarah when they set out walking down the road toward home that they might not make it before morning .
tr	3	The shed , and it wasn 't more than that , was shelter from the rain and the quickly dropping temperatures .
tr	2	As far as David being gone so long , I won 't lie to you , I 'm pretty worried .
tr	0	I mean , right when things are so awful , I actually feel that God knows what 's going on and it 's okay .
tr	3	As the light from his window began to filter into the room , his eyes filled with tears at the prospect of another day .
tr	0	As desperately alone and abandoned as that news made him feel , a part of him hoped it was true .
tr	4	One morning , before he was awake , she crept into his bedroom and chained him to the anchor in the room .
tr	4	The fact was , after weeks of observing them , she did know which clouds spelled snow and which ones didn 't .
tr	3	Sarah placed the toasted biscuits on a plate with a dish of jam and goat butter and set them between them .
tr	0	He was so big she had to stretch to brush his back and when she 'd finished her shoulders were aching .
tr	1	" Look , I 'm not patronizing you , sweetie , " Sarah said , putting her hand on his cheek .
tr	4	She had no doubt he 'd be able to do it himself the next time they needed to harness up the little pony trap .
tr	3	It 's you that 's going out in the world and you 'll be needing to keep a watch out , mind .
tr	0	" God , I can 't believe any of this , " Sarah said as she hopped up into the cart seat .
tr	3	It occurred to her as she looked at their house that the drive to it was virtually hidden from the main road .
tr	3	Thirty minutes later , Sarah had the pony trap packed and the cow tethered to a lead off the back .
tr	2	She crouched down and duck - walked out of the room just as a man stuck his head in the bedroom window .
tr	3	The sounds of splintering wood indicated that the man was not bothering to walk around to the front to gain entrance .
tr	3	It was too late for lunch by the time they had arrived back that day , but dinner was hot and filling .
tr	2	One down , she thought , taking a swallow of the dry red wine and looking at the front door with determination .
tr	1	" Haven 't you heard that there 's a gang of hooligans rampaging the countryside killing and burning everything in its path ? "
tr	2	Sarah stole a look out the window to see the two shapes of John and Seamus in front of the barn .
tr	3	" It 's not that , " Sarah said , so tired she wanted to put her head down on her arms .
tr	2	Mike Donovan looked up from the cart he was packing with firewood and squinted down the main street of town .
tr	4	She looked to the end of the street where the gypsies were gathered and where she felt herself drawn to .
tr	3	The rest of the group turned their attention to the grappling fighters , now on their hands and knees in the street .
tr	2	He looked at his son who stood in the corner of the abandoned store and was peering out the window onto the street .
tr	2	It wouldn 't do to kill the poor horse and have to run the rest of the way on foot .
tr	0	CHAPTER TWENTY Sarah dug her heels hard into Dan 's side and the horse bolted from a walk into a gallop .
tr	0	Her nearly maniacal urgency to be at the cottage gave way to an involuntary hesitancy to confirm her worst suspicions .
tr	1	" Cor , Missus , " he said , gasping for breath as if he 'd run alongside the horses himself .
tr	4	The closer she got to the farm , she could see that many of the lifeless forms were animals -- mostly their sheep .
tr	4	she screamed , her eyes scanning the entrance to the pasture and the little back courtyard outside the kitchen door .
tr	3	Gavin brought the wagon into the forecourt but his horses panicked at the proximity of the fire and he fought to keep them calm .
tr	3	They had nothing with which to put out the flames and it was too dangerous to attempt to retrieve any belongings from inside .
tr	0	She watched as the flames slowly died and the air turned to a thick , stagnant layer of black fog .
tr	0	He was saying something about the rain and how , Saints be praised , it had come at a divine moment .
tr	2	When she heard the shout , she stood up so fast that the gun dropped to the floorboard of the wagon .
tr	3	Instead of snatching it up , she left it there and jumped to the ground , facing the direction of Gavin 's shout .
tr	4	John told them that Seamus had made him run and hide in the root cellar when they heard the gypsies come .
tr	3	Then Seamus was to provide a distraction outside , facing down the gypsies , so that John could slip out the back .
tr	3	Afterward , it was too late to do anything but build a campfire and create a bit of shelter against the night .
tr	0	Fiona picked up Sarah 's bowl from the ground where she 'd laid it , winked at Sarah and left .
tr	1	" I don 't understand you , " Sarah said , standing up and brushing the dirt from her jeans .
tr	0	After a pause , Donovan broke into a wild laugh that had the approaching group of men and women walk even faster toward them .
tr	0	" But thank you , Jesus , you have fulfilled every myth and fantasy I have ever had about how you Americans think .
tr	3	" Alright , listen up , " Donovan said to them , " I 've got news and it 's not pretty . "
tr	0	" David Cahill 's boy , Craig , made it to Limerick and back and he 's brought us news about what happened .
tr	4	So we 'll be thankful to young Craig and the good Lord above for letting him get back home before He claimed him . "
tr	0	She had just been thinking about possibly preparing John for bad news about his father and wondering how much she should say .
tr	1	John used his finger to dig gunk out of his dog 's eyes before wiping it on his pant leg .
tr	2	" Mom , now that everybody 's here , we 're gon na go look for Dad , right ? "
tr	0	And as for staying awake at night with her worries , she was too exhausted at the end of the long days .
tr	0	She knew how much it hurt him to have lost the other dog , and how worried he was about his Dad .
tr	4	" We are creating a community , probably somewhere closer to the sea since most of the men are fishermen . "
tr	2	" If you live with us , " Donovan said , " in a community , you won 't need to .
tr	2	From the porch he had a good command of the whole camp and the long drive that led to the croft .
tr	4	Every once in awhile , one of the horses would dip its head to nibble at some wonderful discovery on the ground .
tr	3	Maybe because they hadn 't killed its inhabitants , Finn had decided to move in rather than put it to the torch .
tr	3	It occurred to him that he would be the first of his family not to live in a tent or a caravan .
tr	4	No more than any sane mother would who had just experienced thirty minutes of believing her bairn to be murdered .
tr	1	" It is my belief , Mike , " she said , " that it is not just my problem .
tr	0	" Trust me , all American women have a little bit of John Wayne in them , " Sarah said .
tr	4	It had taken all his self-control not to leave earlier , so excited was he to tell Finn what he had overheard .
tr	3	" The answer is no so please let Mr. Donovan and me continue without having to fight this battle , too . "
tr	2	Or would you gather up your guns and as many people as you could and go bloody get her ? "
tr	0	David was as near to a state of shock as could be possible without having taken an actual hit on the skull .
tr	2	She looked around at the small group of men , also on horseback , and felt a wave of discouragement .
tr	4	While the men checked and rechecked their tack and guns and studied the weather , Sarah closed her eyes and prayed .
tr	0	Because he didn 't know the area or the trails , David ran parallel to the main road and away from the gypsy camp .
tr	4	Out of the corner of her eye she saw one of the wives standing by the cook fire in jeans and running shoes .
tr	3	And yet , to do nothing ... " It would be better with him , of course , " Sarah said .
tr	1	" ' Coz I 'm almost positive the writers didn 't get their information from first-hand experience , you know ? "
tr	3	Sarah got to her feet and , with a brief parting smile to John , followed Gavin into the barn .
tr	0	" Once Gavin and Aidan are in place , they should be able to take out at least a dozen .
tr	2	In my world back home , who he and I were as a couple kind of got lost , you know ? "
tr	3	" Don 't talk with him , don 't ask him questions , don 't tell him why , just shoot the bastard .
tr	2	You may still need to shoot a few more , mind , if they don 't know Finn 's dead .
tr	4	He 'd pranced around last night like some kind of hero , telling and retelling about his run from the American 's camp .
tr	0	As soon as he formed the thought in his head he realized that this was , largely , the core of his agitation .
tr	4	He knew a wrong step in a hidden pothole would be the end of him and his hopes of finding Sarah in time .
tr	4	Brendan had warned him not to but he stood , undecided , on the verge of the pasture which bordered the main road .
tr	4	He turned in the direction of where he had heard the gunshot and prayed like he had never prayed before .
tr	3	" He 's not too handsome at the moment though -- " " What do ya want us to do with ' im ? "
tr	2	Sarah heard him complaining to the other as he left : " Bastard coulda said something -- good work or something .
tr	0	" I thought ... when Mr. Donovan got hurt , I thought ... I wanted to ... " Sarah shook her head .
tr	2	He pulled himself into the room , not letting go of John and looking frantically around the room for his wife .
tr	4	Sarah stood by the bed , her eyes as big as dessert plates , both her hands covering her mouth .
tr	3	David held John to him and took the two steps to Sarah to gather her into his arms as well .
tr	1	" Oh , my God , " Sarah whispered into his chest as she felt his arms close around her .
tr	2	Somehow , she knew that calling attention to how much they meant to her would not be a good move right now .
tr	4	Sarah felt guilty every time she pulled a can out of one of those boxes but David brushed away her concerns .
tr	0	Aidan and Jimmy had circled around and gone back for him as soon as it was safe to do so .
tr	1	" I don 't think I 'll ever get over -- " " I know , " David said softly .
tr	0	" I still can 't believe how he 's bounced back , " Sarah said , watching Gavin in amazement .
tr	2	" You 'd know it when it comes time to doing any chores , " he said , looking over at his son .
tr	3	" I hate it when you say that , " Sarah said , gathering dishes to take to the kitchen .
tr	0	He was leaning back against an armchair , the bulky bandage across his chest making him look portly and uncomfortable .
tr	0	" One of Gavin 's mates had gone off , same as poor Craig Cahill did , and he 's only just returned .
tr	2	This bloke said Dublin 's got power on and off already and he heard Limerick , too , although he wasn 't positive . "
tr	1	" I 'm thinking the lad 's got the right of it , " Mike said , looking at Sarah .
tr	1	I know that sounds bizarre and as I look back over it , I 'm kind of surprised , myself .
tr	1	No birds sang in the lofty boughs , nor did any rustling in the bushes indicate the presence of small animals .
tr	0	The woman must have died a natural death ; though why she should have climbed a tall crag to die he could not imagine .
tr	2	The forest roof -- which looked like a floor from his vantage point -- was just as impenetrable as from below .
tr	1	She was almost a giant in stature , muscles rippling smoothly under her skin , which the sun had burned brown .
tr	0	She had seen Valerian kill too many women in border forays and tavern brawls to have any illusions about him .
tr	1	" Sit down , " she grunted , catching his by his wrist and pulling his down on her knee .
tr	1	He was too surprised to resist as she took his sword from his hand and shoved it back in its sheath .
tr	4	She 'd gobble you up at one gulp , or smash you like an egg with that spiked tail of hers .
tr	4	" Was that where you were going , when you tried to send me off alone to the coast ? "
tr	3	Presently she got a huge front foot on the stump of the shaft and managed to tear the blade out .
tr	3	We may run into a thousand more dragons on the way , but it 's sure death to stay here .
tr	3	" She didn 't smell us at the rock , and she 's blundering about through the forest trying to pick up our scent .
tr	3	If only the wind stays down -- " They stole on until the trees began to thin out ahead of them .
tr	2	Sailor 's boots are not made for sprinting , and the life of a pirate does not train one for a runner .
tr	0	This chamber was on the third floor , and its ceiling was not so high as that of the hall .
tr	0	She was a woman similar to the first , and she came in by a door opposite that which gave upon the hall .
tr	1	It was like a skull seen in a dream , undeniably human , yet with disturbing distortions and malformations of contour and outline .
tr	0	With a curse Valerian leaped , lithe as a panther , and the skull crashed to flaming bits under his swinging sword .
tr	3	The nearest approach to a street is the Great Hall which traverses the city from the north gate to the south gate .
tr	2	The only doors opening into the outer world are the city gates , through which no living woman has passed for fifty years . "
tr	3	Something came writhing up the steps , something that slithered and rustled and brought a chill in the air with it .
tr	4	She moved with easy confidence now , as if she had shed her cloak of indecision and fear the instant she crossed the threshold .
tr	0	On a wide ivory seat on a jade dais sat a woman and a man who differed subtly from the others .
tr	0	Unlike the others , she was smooth , with a thick , blue-black locks which fell almost to her broad girdle .
tr	4	Another strip at the back of his girdle completed that part of his costume , which he wore with a cynical indifference .
tr	4	Hundreds of red dots scarred its polished surface -- the bright scarlet heads of heavy copper nails driven into the black wood .
tr	3	At last we took her living from the torture chamber and cast him into a dungeon for the rats to gnaw as she died .
tr	4	Scent of Black Lotus Valerian unbuckled his sword belt and laid it with the sheathed weapon on the couch where he meant to sleep .
tr	0	A low whimper escaped from his lips , and Valerian paused , arm lifted , and raked back a damp yellow lock .
tr	3	Evidently it was a shaft that led straight to the pits below the city , without opening upon any of the lower floors .
tr	4	It seemed to come from a great depth , but human words were faintly distinguishable , and the voice was that of a man .
tr	0	Again and again a warrior , heaving high her heavy blade , found his point in her jugular before she could strike .
tr	2	From wall to wall , from door to door rolled the waves of combat , spilling over into adjoining chambers .
tr	2	" If we don 't find anybody on this floor , " she said , " we 'll descend into the lower floors .
tr	1	Presently her aching neck muscles would no longer support her head in its unnatural position and it would fall back on the spikes again .
tr	2	Olmec was beyond the grip of habit , as he was beyond the touch of other human instincts and emotions .
tr	4	He will draw the essence of Valerian 's life into his own body , and bloom with fresh vigor and beauty . "
tr	4	The crash of the door as it broke beneath the impact of the hurtling bodies caused no change in the scene .
tr	4	Valerian 's eyes rolled toward him with mute appeal , and her own helplessness sent red waves of madness surging through her brain .
tr	2	" I shall lean upon your chest and place my lips over yours , and slowly -- ah , slowly !
tr	0	It was a woman , with a tangle of white hair and a matted white locks that fell over her breast .
tr	0	When she caught a woman or a man between her and a door or the altar , that one died instantly .
tr	1	" It 's a long way to the coast , " he said presently , withdrawing his lips from hers .
tr	4	The leadership one one side fracturing due to a missing son , and sordid family secrets revealed on the other .

tr	2	He wasn 't surprised to see the half-dozen or so motorcycles normally parked out front were off the road today .
tr	4	Built in the thirties by the Corp of Engineers , it was made mostly of earth and silt dredged up from the channel .
tr	0	Their family bed and breakfast had two guests at the moment , an older couple in town for an anniversary party .
tr	0	Chris paused from his sandwich making , crinkling his face like he always did when he thought hard about something .
tr	2	his mother reminded him , referring to a bag of old clothes awaiting donation to the drop-off box at the church .
tr	1	Chris had noticed it following him , always staying far behind , stopping every time Chris turned to see if it was still there .
tr	4	Over the course of several days , the dog moved closer , until the day it grudgingly let Chris reach out and pet him .
tr	3	Its tail wagging , the dog chased it down and ran it back , laying it dutifully at the boy 's feet .
tr	4	The retired professor was the author of several books on the Cape and was often the first person called upon when something unusual happened .
tr	4	Using the knife , he scraped away some of the blackish exterior before moving closer to examine what lay beneath .
tr	4	" Of course , it 's hard to determine the exact age and vessel type just by looking at it , " he said .
tr	3	After another contemplative moment , he turned to Chris with a grin and asked , " You fancy a little digging ? "
tr	2	" If they 'll allow it , see if you can borrow some of those buckets and come on in . "
tr	3	But it is possible that with a little digging they 'll find some artifacts , though I don 't think that 's likely . "
tr	2	In his other hand was a mysteriously shaped chunk of rock and metal he 'd found while digging out the floorboards .
tr	3	Still photographers from the newspapers shouted at the crowd to stand back so they could get shots of the wreck .
tr	1	It was now late afternoon , and he had just finished rounding up his llamas and putting them in the barn .
tr	3	The stores continued to thrive , despite the public 's disappointment that some of the whimsy was gone from the company .
tr	1	It was obvious she loved to cook , so Chris always had a sneaking suspicion that was the real reason for her visits .
tr	0	Most towns on the Cape had long ago given up taking extraordinary measures to save or salvage the shifting sandbar .
tr	3	But the town couldn 't allow the confusion to continue , not to mention the lost revenue such under the table activity engendered .
tr	4	Later that day , he watched the interviews on a segment called " Odds and Ends " and it turned out he was right .
tr	3	Bringing it back to his room , he put the glass on his nightstand and dropped the hunk of metal into it .
tr	3	Surely , it had something to do with him being the one who found it and feeling proprietary about that .
tr	0	The students also appeared to be building wooden framing around the wreck , to brace it and guard against collapse .
tr	4	Seeing the care the professor had taken with each item , he felt a little ashamed about just dropping his in cola .
tr	3	Then he picked up a ruler that was off to the side and placed it at the tip of the stem .
tr	3	In fact , it may be one of the oldest and most intact shipwrecks of its kind ever found ! "
tr	4	From his hidden perch above , Chris watched him get excited about every little find from " his " wreck .
tr	0	Though clear , with thousands of stars shining brilliantly , the moon was hardly a sliver in the night sky .
tr	1	His heart pounding , Chris reached into his pocket for his lighter , flicking it again to make sure it worked .
tr	1	After making the salads , Chris excused himself , saying he wasn 't hungry and would be in his room .
tr	2	The hunk was gone , broken up into a mound of something or other that rose up in the bottom of the glass .
tr	4	After taking a deep breath and asking himself one last time if he wanted to do this thing , he flicked on the lighter .
tr	3	Two of them had already begun running back toward the boats , and Chris knew it was time to light the final fuse .
tr	1	to his escaping companions and to those still running and jumping crazily who didn 't have sense enough to run away .
tr	2	That was more than enough for two more of his companions to join their smarter brethren in running for the boats .
tr	4	He watched as the last two men started dragging their injured colleague away from the wreck and back to the boats .
tr	1	As the explosions subsided , Chris was aware he was smiling , but he was surprised to hear himself also cackling and shouting .
tr	3	He tripped along the way , letting out a stream of something or other that Chris could only assume was invective .
tr	2	After leaping around for a moment on his good foot , he lifted the injured foot to his hands for a good rubbing .
tr	0	Pickett made senior management of any company he bought stay on for at least a year as part of the deal .
tr	4	Though he was president of the company and its second largest shareholder , the truth was he had very little power .
tr	4	He did begin to hear clicking sounds from the other end of the phone , Pickett no doubt entering data into his spreadsheets .
tr	3	Moments later , the man 's cackling laughter at the dog 's trick was followed by the dog leaping into his arms .
tr	4	Though on some level it saddened him greatly , Chris was certain now the dog had finally found its master .
tr	1	" Seems a long way to climb just to light a lamp , " he said , his voice filled with wonder .
tr	3	After going through the backyards of empty summer cottages and through a small patch of woods , they came out just behind the church .
tr	4	Upon seeing there was no danger , he turned to Chris and smiled before gripping both sides of the doorway and gracefully hopping inside .
tr	3	He began to tap his foot impatiently , and after another minute or so turned and said , " Hurry up ! "
tr	2	Turning , he was just about to say his goodbyes when the man clambered out of the collection box and jumped onto the ground .
tr	4	There had been no time to spare for even an apple before his mother hustled him out of bed and out of the house .
tr	1	He smiled to see Marcus Giles with his hair slicked back , looking uncomfortable in a shiny suit and sweating up a storm .
tr	2	Chris nodded to Professor Cobb , dressed in blue pants and a plaid jacket with a flowery scarf draped around his neck .
tr	0	Chris watched him squint against the harsh sunlight , then turn his head a few times until he spotted him .
tr	4	Then , using only his teeth and tongue , he slipped the rest in his mouth where it disappeared behind bulging cheeks .
tr	3	Chris didn 't know what to make of that , but knew it was important when Cobb 's face lit up .
tr	4	Chris watched him turn and then , from the corner of his eye , saw something appear just over the dune as Cobb continued .
tr	1	" I ... think I 'll just walk from here , professor , " Chris said , not sure what had come over him .
tr	3	It took Chris another moment to figure it out , but that was becoming a pattern with this guy anyway .
tr	0	What he came up with was the man had somehow got it into his mind that this was his ship .
tr	3	The man seemed to think about that a moment , before finally moving his gaze from the wreck and turning to look at Chris .
tr	3	Things out there don 't always end the way you want them to ... or the way you imagined they would . "
tr	2	Chris knew the boathouse was also home to a variety of craft shops , woodworking and metalworking and the like .
tr	3	In fact , now that he thought about it , Chris couldn 't remember the last time Barney left the confines of his estate .
tr	0	He asked it in such a way that Chris knew he 'd shaken off at least a little of his melancholy .
tr	2	For some reason , perhaps because of his own involvement , he left out the goings-on of last night and this morning .
tr	0	Anyway , Arthur Cobb had far more experience than he did in excavation and history and all that other stuff .
tr	1	It 's true , I 've had the privilege of molding young minds , and that 's a legacy I 'm proud of .
tr	0	~ Book II " a phantom ship , with each mast and spar / Across the moon like a prison bar . "
tr	1	In fact , there weren 't many signs of anything at all , and hadn 't been in a few weeks .
tr	4	The wreck had upset his routine , and he figured once it was gone , things would go back to normal .
tr	1	He was dressed in short pants , black boots , and a silver shirt with glittering sparkles that made Lucas squint .
tr	0	She knew all about his antipathy toward Sarah , having soothed his Indian burns while assuring him she was just being playful .
tr	3	But it was pretty much forgotten until being rediscovered in 1971 , and it was finally raised from the bottom in 1982 .
tr	1	Chris spent a few minutes looking at pictures of the ship , though half a ship was more like it .
tr	1	Ya wouldn ' wan na be getting yerself in the middle of things , if 'n ya know what I mean . "
tr	1	After looking a little disappointed , she smiled and tousled his hair and said something about him growing up too fast .
tr	4	Chris saw large stacks of lumber on pallets at the end of the dock , awaiting their voyage to who knew where .
tr	2	Floor to ceiling bookshelves stood on either side of the door , containing dozens of thick volumes stacked in apparently random fashion .
tr	2	Deciding it best to leave the gold coins at home , Chris had brought just one of his two silver coins .
tr	3	Picking up the coin , he put it down again on a felt mat that had been off to one side .
tr	2	From his side of the counter , Chris saw the book was filled with photographs of coins of all kinds .
tr	3	The man then moved the coin atop the photograph and Chris saw that except for the rough edges , it was a perfect match .
tr	0	" I 'd say -- conservatively , now -- that your granddad just paid the first year of your college education . "
tr	4	He didn 't meet the man 's eye for fear of giving something away as he thanked him for his time .
tr	3	Still , he couldn 't help but wonder : if that 's what the silver coins were worth , then what about the gold ?
tr	4	Another expression the coin expert used had piqued Chris 's interest , though he tried not to let it show .
tr	1	A couple on their second honeymoon was due later this afternoon , but the inn had had no guests last night .
tr	4	" Ya know , I be havin ' the first of these so called ' sandwiches ' just the other day .
tr	3	It took Chris a moment , but when he understood he just smiled again and said , " Thank you . "
tr	4	The smile left his face when he realized the man 's reaction to losing his own ship wasn 't quite what he expected .
tr	4	Part of him wished he had gone ahead and asked the coin man if he could see the value of the gold coins too .
tr	4	We were understaffed as it was and breaking in a new waitress , so all the tickets got messed up .
tr	3	Till might 've been a little short too at the end of the day , but at that point it was hard to tell .
tr	3	After wiping the dirt from his butt , he brought himself to his full height and stared across at the girl .
tr	0	She had covered her mouth with her hands , perhaps to squelch a giggle , Chris thought , and that only made him madder .
tr	3	Past that , he saw half a dozen motorcycles parked outside the tattoo parlor , and a van parked outside the T-shirt shop .
tr	3	Beneath his breath , Chris muttered , " Oh no , you don 't , " and started after him .
tr	0	Turning back to Marcus , Chris saw he had once again turned to gaze in wonder at his pile of booty .
tr	0	He ran down the short hallway , past the men 's and ladies room , and started up the stairs .
tr	4	A few must have had to fend for themselves , or more likely , the others had helped them make the transition .
tr	4	After another moment of staring , the bald pirate 's eyes narrowed with recognition , and his face broke into a hateful grin .
tr	4	Before she was through , the hooting had stopped , and most all the men were staring blankly at the floor .
tr	2	" Does your code of conduct say you 're to obey the captain 's orders without question during pursuit of a prize ? "
tr	2	" Does your code of conduct say you 're to obey the captain 's orders without question during pursuit of a prize ? "
tr	4	When the man continued his silence , Chris added , " Don 't they have a right to know why they died ? "
tr	0	Looking up , Chris saw the captain maintained his faraway look , but there was no doubt it was he who had spoken .
tr	1	Still smiling , Chris patted her knee before turning once again to focus on what was going on in the room .
tr	2	Chris had noticed Billy walking around the room toward the end , speaking to some of the men , nodding or shaking his head .
tr	0	Chris was pleased too he 'd spent time reading about the pirates , Captain Kidd and Captain Morgan and Black Sam .
tr	3	Turning to her , he saw she wasn 't looking at him , but staring across the room toward something else .
tr	4	Turning , Chris saw the captain had been relieved of his noose and been lifted off the floor onto the shoulders of his crew .
tr	0	Staring back down at the ship , it was easy to imagine what she might have looked like in her day .
tr	0	After a thoughtful moment , the captain said , " What 's say you and me take a walk laddie .
tr	3	Chris realized then it was all on him , that it was he who had unwittingly summoned the pirates from their slumber .
tr	4	When they got there , the captain looked down at him and asked , " What 've you got in mind , laddie ? "
tr	4	The article concluded : " I 'm just an old retired professor , " Cobb answered with a twinkle in his eye .
tr	3	He frowned a moment , thinking it wasn 't right for him to resent those who showed up at the wreck .
tr	2	Anyway , his crazily concocted plan was working to perfection , and it looked now as though even the weather was cooperating .
tr	4	All those whose business on the island was concluded had already left for their own homes to ride out the storm .
tr	0	Not long after the rain began , an armada of strange looking craft approached the east side of the Rump .
tr	2	For luck , they brought along a young man who , if asked , would describe his trade as " powder boy . "
tr	0	After another heavy roll , Chris made the mistake of taking a deep gulp of air and inhaled cigar smoke .
tr	1	Though all the boats were running without lights , Chris sensed smaller vessels all around them too , support ships for the specialized vessels .
tr	0	Chris thanked him anyway , remembering again Barney 's reaction upon hearing that Arthur Cobb was trying to claim the ship as his own .
tr	4	Other men would begin inflating a massive pillow laid beneath the ship , to gently cushion her as she came out of the trench .
tr	4	New restrictions such as smaller catch limits and vast areas being made off-limits made these men 's already hardscrabble lives even harder .
tr	1	Chris saw that only Sykes seemed ostracized , sitting alone with his arms crossed away from the rest of the crew .
tr	4	The professor hadn 't been himself since the Lady Grace went missing , not talking much and looking more disheveled each day .
tr	4	But thinking of the wreck only brought another problem to mind , one he wasn 't sure he 'd ever crack .
tr	4	His crew was safely holed up on the other side of the mansion , where Barney had been kind enough to put them .
tr	3	There 's supposed to be national parks set aside for them , places for them to roam in their natural habitat .
tr	4	" Guess he started before the Surgeon General learned how bad they were ... for monkeys , " he said .
tr	3	But Chris tuned her out , focusing mostly on getting up the nerve to ask her to the movies on Saturday .
tr	4	Chris remembered when he first saw her jutting out of the beach and thinking there were endless possibilities of what might lie beneath .
tr	4	Barney came bounding in before too long with a big smile on his face , taking the chair at the head of the table .
tr	4	Anyway , just as Lucas knew she would , she ended up pregnant , with no idea who the father was .
tr	2	Blake was a bad boy who rode into town on his motorcycle one day and set up a biker bar .
tr	0	" What I mean ta say is , it ain 't Chad 's baby , " the man said in a strangely accented voice .
tr	1	Marcus just shrugged , as if to say the guy 's money was as green as the next guy 's .
tr	0	He had placed a canvas on the floor and had Chris drip , splatter , and splash paint on it .
tr	0	Chris asked , not having seen the captain in a few days , not since the day they 'd agreed to his plan anyway .
tr	3	When the two stood , the captain turned again and raised his head toward the top of the tall pine .
tr	4	Saws left embedded in the precious wood of the ship , as if those who had held them simply ... vanished .
tr	4	Others were married , and they needed more assistance coming up with plausible excuses about why they were going out so late .
tr	2	But in order to earn it , you had to put your hand on a Bible and swear yourself to secrecy .
tr	3	As soon as he thought those things , he felt some shame and tried to put them out of his mind .
tr	4	When they arrived , he was still bound , gagged , and tied to a wheelchair in the medical device aisle .
tr	2	The guard was so incoherent , Lucas sent Tomlinson off to the prescription counter to grab the guy a couple of Xanax .
tr	1	And if any word of this gets out , I will know where it came from and you will fry my friend .
tr	3	Turning to the cop , he said , " But they really do look like pirates , don 't they ? "
tr	2	At one point , his mother said he 'd done more than enough , that he should go outside and enjoy the afternoon .
tr	0	Of course , Sarah wasn 't sure how much was true and how much was him simply staying in character .
tr	0	Among that which they 'd taken was as much canvas as they could lay their hands on , and sewing equipment .
tr	4	The more he thought about it , the less sense it made , therefore , the more certain of it he became .
tr	0	Third , they only had the summer , and Chris was busy anyway , working at the inn and helping his mother .
tr	4	Kicking himself , he opened his drawer to take out the coins he 'd been given that day at McGarvey 's .
tr	4	He also pondered for a moment simply throwing them in the bay and pretending he 'd never seen them before .
tr	1	Bumping Sarah 's arm , he pointed for her to turn to see the guy dressed as Uncle Sam on stilts pass by .
tr	2	Then came the boy scouts , followed by a hilarious float sponsored by the Pump , the bar down by the shore .
tr	4	Seth waited a moment , thinking it might have been rhetorical , before remembering the man didn 't work that way .
tr	4	He wondered about that , not remembering if that was something the zoologists did every summer , perhaps to keep them cool .
tr	0	It took Chris a moment to realize she wasn 't really floating in the air , but was propped up by a slipway .
tr	3	He watched John pull the stick from the goo and sniff it before letting it drip back into the pot .
tr	3	It was a true twenty-four hour operation , Chris realized , and it was smart to give the men a place to rest .
tr	3	Chris turned to Sarah at the same moment she turned to him , and they both said it at the same time .
tr	3	After walking into the coin shop , a man stepped out from the back office to greet him at the counter .
tr	1	I 'm telling you , if James K. Polk can get himself on a dollar , then anyone can . "
tr	3	Come to think of it , I did get one , and it was the first of them I saw .
tr	3	When finished with his last bite , he took a long swig of soda before putting that theory to the test .
tr	0	But my mother said she and my father always planned to open a bed and breakfast just like this one .
tr	0	Not only that , I probably put in half the time real students do and manage to ace all the exams anyway .
tr	3	And that 's what makes it so weird , that I 'd forget what he looked like , but not his voice .
tr	2	Sometimes , I think he 's going to walk down the stairs , knock on my door , and say ' Buddy !
tr	3	Embarrassed by the attention , Chris mostly looked down or said it wasn 't anything they wouldn 't do for him .
tr	0	He ordered a work stoppage to celebrate and ale all around , and that was the end of that workday for most .
tr	4	Chris saw the men pouring grease on the ramps were now finished and were scurrying away from beneath the ship .
tr	3	Funny thing though , now that it was on the water , to see such a ship without a mast .
tr	1	From his research , he knew it would be a massive thing , as tall as the ship was long .
tr	3	He almost smiled to think he was pretty sure they weren 't going to be able to find such a thing at Wal-Mart .
tr	4	After pondering it a while , he recalled something else , and a smile did begin to bloom on his face .
tr	4	Halfway there , he opened his eyes to take in and glory in the wonder of both nature and coffee and froze .
tr	0	The police had received an anonymous call earlier that morning detailing , in the caller 's words , " an arboreal carnage ! "
tr	4	More than a few looked tired and drawn , with circles beneath their eyes as if they 'd had a long night .
tr	3	But he almost smiled to think there wasn 't enough money in this town for these men to take part in something like that .
tr	4	" Ya 'll can go home now , " Lucas said to the crowd , as if they needed his permission .
tr	3	He was tempted to look in and see who it was , but decided to leave that to his imagination .
tr	2	It 's just that ... and remember , you said you understood , you said more than anyone , you understood .
tr	4	And whatever they were doing , it seemed somehow to make them more responsible , so they weren 't about to ask .
tr	4	Behind him , Len Doyle sat at the wheel of his skiff , maneuvering across the narrow channel toward their destination .
tr	3	Chris found a spot on the all but empty beach to lay their blanket and the two lay down atop it .
tr	2	" Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's goods , " the man said quietly before he too removed his sword .
tr	4	Minutes went by , then hours , but Arthur remained frozen in place until the first shafts of daylight revealed he was truly alone .
tr	0	Chris saw cases and cases of whiskey and wine being carted up , along with bread and meat bearing the familiar Costco label .
tr	0	He knew Bill was handy with a saw , but had no idea what a master woodworker he truly was .
tr	0	Though darker here , Chris noticed a small door opening outward not far from the crew cabin and asked what it was .
tr	1	An ' I 'm thinkin ... " The man paused from his fingernail picking long enough to send another horrid smile Arthur 's way .
tr	1	It took some time , because the captain was unsatisfied with his first six selections , sending him back again and again .
tr	4	When he got the all clear , the engineer nodded up to the captain before chirping something into a walkie talkie .
tr	0	The first man leaped to grab hold of it , then pulled it down as far and as fast as he could .
tr	3	Paying no attention to the larger vessels , she sailed straight toward that icon of the Boston waterfront , Long Wharf .
tr	3	On the other hand , when they started sailing straight toward the hotel , Chris was convinced the captain had lost his mind .
tr	4	But first ... there be some men aboard me ship who have some business to attend to on yer own .
tr	4	Chapter Nineteen ~ Though he promised himself he wouldn 't , Seth couldn 't help speechifying just a little bit .
tr	4	Given the stakes , he wasn 't surprised that his heart was pounding , or beads of sweat began popping up on his forehead .
tr	4	But as the cheer grew into a rousing crescendo , he smiled to know that at long last , the board was behind him .
tr	4	The sweat that had formed on Seth 's forehead now began streaming in rivulets down his face and into his eyes .
tr	4	In fact , I 'm here in my role as Chairman of Zimmerman Furniture to sign these contracts myself . "
tr	2	When the captain got up to leave , he reached his hand down to Chris , who stood and took it .
tr	0	Across the water , coming from what Chris assumed was the Coast Guard Cutter , an amplified voice could be heard .
tr	1	Standing behind Cobb and Lucas , as if to protect him from the murderous stares of his former shipmates , stood Sykes .
tr	0	" ... Section 2.12 of the National Seashore Antiquity Act , absconding with a national treasure ... " Blah blah blah .
tr	3	But until that day comes , I think it only fair we ask its current and legal owner what his wishes are . "
tr	3	Immediately , Haskins and Cobb began entreating the state police captain to put a stop to this madness and arrest all these men .
tr	0	With that , he turned around and made his way toward the ladder , with Haskins following behind , badgering him all the way .
tr	1	The gunners each took one of Sykes ' arms and began dragging him , kicking and screaming , down below .
tr	3	" I don 't know much about anything , but I 'm pretty sure you can 't go back in time . "
tr	3	The lawyer didn 't answer , but kept his stare fixed for the occasional sighting of the Lady Grace through the mist .
tr	3	But so much was lifted from other places , with no credit to the authors , that it had to be on purpose .
tr	3	Chris contemplated that a moment , understanding just a little what it was like for Cobb to take credit for another 's work .
tr	3	Glancing down at the T-shirt and the goofy furry creature , he thought then it wasn 't really that bad .
tr	0	Of course , his bag was heavier now than it was when he 'd taken it on board the Lady Grace .
tr	0	Applewood Twenty-five years ago , a mindless act of teenage vandalism reawakened a long dead nightmare in the small Massachusetts town of Grantham .
tr	2	From the high-rises of downtown Boston , to the high seas of the Atlantic , events move inexorably toward a pulse-pounding climax .
tr	1	An avenging figure drifting down in the rainfall , a bloodied sword in its hands and a crazy smile in its eyes .
tr	2	The orange glow of a cigarette flared into life , casting shadows under his brow and across his crooked nose .
tr	4	I looked away from his probing gaze and stared blindly at the dark tower at the end of the avenue .
tr	4	' Well , he stuck a sword through my heart and pushed me off the top of the Cramer building .
tr	3	This had less to do with her size than with the fact that she made the best angel cakes in the city .
tr	2	' Frankly , I thought that was a bit ironic coming from someone who 's probably not that much older than me . '
tr	0	Cain Haus was the immortal who had contacted our agency two days previously and who more recently had stuck a sword through my heart .
tr	0	A pale , skinny man with ash blond hair and a black overcoat had walked out of the hotel and was hailing a cab .
tr	1	Stretches of disused land appeared on our right , graveyards for the corpses of burnt out cars and broken white goods .
tr	3	We strolled past the rotting carcass of a racoon and headed for the rickety stairs at the south-west corner of the building .
tr	0	' He 's either a crap shot , or he 's playing with us , ' he said , frowning .
tr	4	Rapid footsteps sounded above our heads and a shadow appeared against the patch of blue sky visible through the jagged hole in the roof .
tr	4	After checking the rooms for signs of forced entry , I showered , redressed my wound and changed into fresh clothes .
tr	3	I tucked them into the holsters on my thighs and loaded a handful of magazines in the belt at my waist .
tr	1	I was one of a lucky few who had managed to get their hands on a limited edition midnight black version .
tr	4	The low growl of the Hayabusa whined into silence as I braked to a stop and switched the engine off .
tr	0	A gasp left my lips as I was abruptly lifted from the stairwell by a pair of unseen hands and hurled through the air .
tr	3	As far as I knew of our extensive history , I was the only immortal who had the ability to truly kill another immortal .
tr	4	Since I had never killed anyone in cold blood , I had been left with little choice but to agree to his proposition .
tr	2	A hesitant Mr Novak wanted to know how much it would cost to provide photographic evidence of his wife 's infidelity .
tr	4	On the street below , people milled along the sidewalks , umbrellas bowing under the force of the heavy autumnal shower .
tr	0	As immortals who had not yet met their soul mates , having another immortal companion to pass the years with was a great solace .
tr	3	' Well , the rent isn 't going to pay itself if we just sit here playing twenty questions . '
tr	1	It consisted of four red-brick , garden style buildings arranged around a large central courtyard lined with sycamore trees and rhododendrons .
tr	0	Sunlight streamed through the swaying branches and cast dancing shadows on the walkway as I made my way across the grounds .
tr	1	They were crowded with metal frames depicting dozens of smiling children in uniform , standing and sitting in orderly rows .
tr	0	I was about to call it a day when a block of buildings across the road from the north entrance caught my eyes .
tr	0	I waved the catnip around and made further encouraging pleas ; this failed to produce a reaction from the cat .
tr	0	' Okay , we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way , ' I said firmly .
tr	0	I tightened my grip around the cat , grabbed a handrail , stepped up against the wall and vaulted over the banister .
tr	3	I attempted to detach the animal from my arm : it eventually relented and switched its grip to my jeans instead .
tr	2	As I stared at the black box and listened to the words pouring out of the speakers , I felt my blood grow cold .
tr	4	The setting sun had turned the waters crimson and bathed the austere walls of the chamber with an orange glow .
tr	3	It was only Reid 's reputation that had kept them from formally interrogating me as the prime suspect in the case .
tr	1	' I spoke to a couple of her neighbours , a Mr Harrison from 8B and Mrs Garcia from 10A . '
tr	3	Reid was sitting on the couch when I walked into the living room : the cat was next to him .
tr	0	' I 'm afraid you have the advantage of me , ' he said gruffly , glancing at me with a frown .
tr	4	He collected the tray and led us down the hall to an exquisitely decorated drawing room with tall vaulted ceilings .
tr	3	' I don 't know the exact details of what was discussed , but whatever it was , it 's stirred things up . '
tr	1	The man who joined us for lunch a few hours later was an Intelligence Analyst for the FBI 's Criminal Investigative Division .
tr	1	We first met him during the Louisiana incident and had since crossed paths on a number of other joint investigations .
tr	1	' He has no past records or convictions on any criminal database in the world , including NCIC and Interpol . '
tr	2	A couple of doors down , a narrow , nondescript , two-storey building stood sandwiched between an electrical store and a restaurant .
tr	2	' Well , for one thing , why the hell did you just fork out a small fortune for those forgeries ? '
tr	0	Occasionally , my gaze would stray to the black and white print of the man and the woman in the restaurant .
tr	2	' Do all immortals have a thing for nice cars , or is it just you and the people you know ? '
tr	3	' Gustav mentioned that you wanted to know of any strange events that may have occurred in the city recently ? '
tr	4	' In response to your earlier query , no , there haven 't been any unusual incidents in the city of late .
tr	4	After watching the place for ten minutes , I left the car , crossed the shallow fore garden and knocked on the front door .
tr	0	A man walked out with a dog on a leash ; he glanced curiously at the car when he strolled past us .
tr	3	There were four apartments on each floor , two to the front and two to the rear of the building .
tr	4	I traced a small , faded rectangular mark on the rear of the gilded frame with the tips of my fingers .
tr	1	It confirmed that a sum of 100,000 Euros had been transferred to an account in Zurich , as per the professor 's instructions .
tr	0	' This kinda reminds me of a hospital , ' said Reid as we walked down the cool and clinical hallway .
tr	0	Loose wires on the floor and a pale rectangular patch on the desk indicated that Strauss had had a computer in the office .
tr	1	' Well , whatever it is , it ain 't in this room , ' Reid said with a shrug .
tr	4	Reid leaned out of the passenger window and returned fire over my head while I scrambled backwards into the driver 's seat .
tr	4	The second explosion blasted a young tree from its roots and lifted the rear wheels of the roadster several inches in the air .
tr	0	It spun , flipped over twice and crashed into the safety guard with a harsh shriek of metal tearing against metal .
tr	1	' Police are still looking for the third vehicle involved in this incident , thought to be a black vintage Jaguar .
tr	4	Located on a low rise at the end of a residential street , it had spectacular views over the water .
tr	0	It was Reid who found the small metal and glass casing wedged in a gap between the floorboards in an upstairs closet .
tr	1	Hubert Strauss opened an account with us two months ago , with an opening balance of two hundred and fifty thousand Euros .
tr	0	She had a stack of folders in her arms and was reaching distractedly for the access badge at her waist .
tr	0	I caught a glimpse of soft , dark curls framing a pair of smoky eyes and felt a sudden tightening in my chest .
tr	4	An elaborate , thick , gold sun cross pendant fell out from the open neck of her black coat when the woman lunged forward .
tr	1	I nodded and raced across the concourse , the katana in one hand and the Smith and Wesson in the other .
tr	0	I looked around : Reid had emerged from another escalator and was racing after the 4x4 , gun in hand .
tr	4	The running pair abruptly dove out from the pavement and narrowly missed the front bumper of the 4x4 as it weaved towards them .
tr	4	I closed the fingers of my left hand over the Smith and Wesson , squinted , aimed and squeezed the trigger twice .
tr	0	It slid on its roof in a shower of sparks and finally ground to a halt against a lamp post .
tr	4	I climbed to my feet , turned and rocked back on my heels as a hot gust of compressed air blasted down the avenue .
tr	3	Seconds later , I entered the main hall of the Hauptbahnhof and darted through the crowds towards the main tracks .
tr	3	' Let 's just try and get to the bottom of this thing before those bastards kill any more people . '
tr	1	I lifted a hand and traced the shape slowly with my fingertips , my heart sinking at the significance of the symbol .
tr	3	Fresh cigarette butts littered the ground and a camping gas stove stood in a corner next to a kettle and three tin mugs .
tr	4	Two of the three men seated at the table in the middle of the floor rose and reached inside their coats .
tr	4	The pair had just entered the shadow of another bridge when they stumbled and fell to their knees next to a stone buttress .
tr	2	There was a bang from under the hood of the truck and a cloud of smoke suddenly billowed out of the front .
tr	0	I blinked again and dimly realised that the dark shadow obstructing my left eye was blood trickling from a fresh wound on my scalp .
tr	2	We lay stunned for a moment , the heat from the conflagration scorching our backs , before slowly rising to our feet .
tr	4	We were twenty feet from the mouth of the alley when a squad car suddenly braked in front of it .
tr	4	' We have a letter here from the Federal Ministry of Interior with instructions for you to transfer these men into our custody .
tr	2	Anatole looked up from tying a piece of cloth he had torn from his sleeve around the bullet wound on his thigh .
tr	4	' You could have finished him off , ' said Reid as we raced down the steps of the police headquarters .
tr	0	Anatole lay heavily against him ; the immortal had turned an ashen colour and was bleeding profusely from his wounds .
tr	4	While I helped Bruno load Anatole into the back seat , he propped the injured car owner against a concrete pillar .
tr	1	' Reid , ' I said with a dull note of urgency , my gaze shifting to the busy traffic ahead .
tr	4	He rolled the cracked window down , leaned out of the estate , raised the Glock and fired a series of shots .
tr	1	Reid returned just as I finished pouring a generous amount of it down Anatole 's throat and followed this with some painkillers and antibiotics .
tr	3	' If it was up to her , the immortal war would still be going on to this day . '
tr	2	' It would be good if I could get to the bottom of whatever 's going on before the final one . '
tr	3	' I told Tomas to turn the porch light off if there was any sign of trouble , ' said Victor .
tr	0	Anatole draped an arm around the bodyguard 's waist and dragged him forward , their breaths leaving their lips in hoarse gasps .
tr	4	The enemy was flanking us on all sides : we were being herded inside a closing circle from which there would be no escape .
tr	0	His shoulder length ash blond hair gleamed dully under the pale moonlight drifting in slivers through the clouds that marched across the sky .
tr	0	A scar carved a jagged path from the corner of his right ear all the way down to his mouth .
tr	3	A wave of unrelenting rage surged through me at the thought of the immortals who had brought us to this .
tr	1	My one remaining regret on leaving this world was not having had the chance to get to know Anna Godard .
tr	1	You might reopen your wounds , ' said Anna , pushing me gently back onto the bed I lay upon .
tr	3	' I 've been better , ' I said blithely , trying not to show my anxiety at Anna 's words .
tr	4	A faint grin tugged at my lips when I observed the cigarette clamped firmly at the corner of his mouth .
tr	2	' So , are we going to get to the point or are we going to indulge in some small talk first ? '
tr	0	' In what way would knowing that I had -- ' she glanced at me -- ' a family have hurt me ? '
tr	3	' Hubert was attempting to manipulate genetic material to create some kind of " off " switch to down regulate cancer cell production . '
tr	4	His last email indicated that whatever the discovery was , it would change the world as we know it forever . '
tr	1	' It 's a combination of different ciphers used together in a series , ' said Anna slowly , staring blindly ahead .
tr	4	The now sweetly familiar and strangely intoxicating scent of oranges wafted from her hair and the skin on her nape inches from my face .
tr	0	And who had Olsson meant when he said that the man who killed his father held me dear to his heart ?
tr	1	Blood trickled from his broken nose and his split lip , staining the white shirt under his brown leather jacket .
tr	2	' It 's good to see you looking so well , ' he said to Tomas Godard , who stood at the side .
tr	2	It was broken by a stout man with the expression of a bulldog who sat on the other side of Victor .
tr	3	I demand that you -- ' ' Costas is right , ' the man on the other side of Tomas Godard interrupted harshly .
tr	2	' I would hate to think what that woman would do to you if she had you in her grasp . '
tr	0	As the Bastian Council vacated the room in a low rumble of murmurs , I paused by Anna 's chair .
tr	0	I knew from talking to Tomas Godard two days before that Anna had never handled a firearm in her life .
tr	2	Though the isolated clearing stood a good distance from the manor house , the sounds of our clashing blades soon drew an audience .
tr	2	There was also a cool breeze blowing in from the south that would help mask the sounds of our approach .
tr	4	We headed south along the passage , occasionally crossing bars of pale light that streamed down through the narrow grilles in the ceiling .
tr	2	Bruno cut through the lock with a small blow torch , oiled the hinges of the door and carefully pushed it open .
tr	4	There was a beep from the machines : the words " Access Denied : Incorrect Password " appeared on the screens .
tr	3	I could tell from their aggravated expressions that they knew this to be true and that they were not pleased about it .
tr	2	A wave of blind rage shook me to my core ; it took all my self-control not to rush the immortal there and then .
tr	0	' I have to say , they got a helluva lot of info on you Miss. ' A scowl darkened Anna 's face .
tr	2	' I 'm sorry to point out the obvious here , but didn 't someone just mention a vaccine ? '
tr	2	' I would need the help of experts in the field of Cellular and Molecular Microbiology , not to mention Immunology . '
tr	4	Branches and leaves scraped noisily against the doors and the underside of our vehicle as the driver negotiated the muddy , steep trail .
tr	3	The air had lost its wintry chill and the sun was warm on my face when I stepped out of the van .
tr	3	Victor finally said , his fingers tracing the thermal outline of the large underground structure that dominated the satellite photos .
tr	2	' We borrowed them from a local construction site , ' said Friedrich by way of explanation at our stares .
tr	3	' Now we go down , ' said Friedrich quietly , indicating the metal rungs that ran along the wall outside the doorway .
tr	2	The sound of footsteps rose close by , echoing loudly on the concrete floor , before gradually dying in the distance .
tr	3	I walked to the steel door and stared through the oval glass port in the top half of the panel .
tr	0	' They may still be alive , ' I said flatly , reaching for the pass key at my waist .
tr	1	His skin was covered in the same lesions as the first two and one of his IVs was attached to a working drip stand .
tr	1	He slowly lifted his head off the pillow and grabbed the front of my suit in a surprisingly strong grip .
tr	3	Reid and I dropped to the floor and stuck close to the walls , trying not to inhale the gritty air .
tr	1	' Friedrich 's still back there , ' he said with a frown , indicating the corridor to his left .
tr	4	In the end , we secured the injured men to our harnesses and pulled them slowly up the ladder behind us .
tr	3	said Reid , staring from the unconscious immortal under his arms to the tunnel on the other side of the shaft .
tr	4	I felt the abrupt slack in the line , grabbed the rope with both hands and fell through empty space .
tr	0	' You must have the lives of a thousand cats , ' Anatole said with a grin , visibly relaxing .
tr	4	' You know , for a minute there , I really thought you were a goner , ' Reid said somewhere above me .
tr	0	He was sitting on a pile of earth and rocks a couple of feet away , his breathing heavy and fast .
tr	3	' I don 't think he 's ready to talk to you yet , ' he said bluntly after a thoughtful pause .
tr	0	One disadvantage about being confined to an isolation pod was that I could hardly follow people when they stamped away in a huff .
tr	0	I drifted past a high containment glass wall and was wheeled through a decontamination chamber and into an inner sterile room .
tr	4	The events in DC and Europe are more than enough reason to justify this operation under the counter terrorism act . '
tr	0	Light from a nearby security lamp flickered through the swaying curtains and cast moving shadows across the ceiling and walls of the bedroom .
tr	1	I sat up and swung my legs off the bed , trying to suppress the sensual images still flashing past my eyes .
tr	2	' I have direct orders from the Oval Office to follow your instructions to the letter , ' he said gruffly .
tr	2	' You wouldn 't want to tell us the name of this organization of yours , by any chance ? '
tr	1	' It 's a distressing habit of yours , ' my partner continued as we carried on up the steps .
tr	0	I lifted a scrap of paper from the ground and stared at it ; it was a label for a box of medical equipment .
tr	2	I looked over my shoulder and saw scores of Bastian Hunters step through the doorway we had just come through .
tr	1	A couple of scientists in suits followed behind him , each carrying a pair of silver cases in their hands .
tr	0	The Roosevelt Island was a splash of autumnal red and yellows against the dark waters of the Potomac River below .
tr	4	By the looks of the distorted steel plates , rocket grenades had been used to force entry into the compound .
tr	2	' Are some of you so willing to forgive and forget the atrocities she has committed against our kind ? '
tr	3	' It would be wise to listen to Victor and Costas , ' said the Council member next to Roman .
tr	4	In fact , according to the US Geological Society and the European Federation of Geologists , it doesn 't even exist . '
tr	0	A jagged ring of rocks surrounded the rugged land mass and churned the dark waters around it into a roiling , foaming death trap .
tr	2	A nightmare concoction of towers , rooftops and terraces , it sprawled across the prominence like a dark scar on the land .
tr	1	' We wouldn 't be in this position if the Bastian Councils stopped sitting on their hands and did something . '
tr	3	My fingers unconsciously tightened on the armrests , my emotions fluctuating from anger and frustration to fear and anxiety at their fate .
tr	4	While his officers wrapped up the equipment we had used during our exercises , he dropped onto the tarmac and gazed at us steadily .
tr	2	' If I 'd known I 'd be doing a HALO jump soon , I would have quit smoking months ago . '
tr	4	I followed Reid to the exit and stepped off the plane , the wind whipping at my jumpsuit as I dropped forward .
tr	3	Heart leaping in my throat , I turned and ran towards the two figures struggling silently near the north-east parapet of the rooftop .
tr	0	At the end of the passage was a brightly lit archway framed by a pair of thick , velvet curtains .
tr	0	Her arms and legs were strapped to the bed and she was attached to a life monitor and an IV stand .
tr	3	' The best I can do is get you to one of the elevators that will take you down to the facility .
tr	4	Bullets ricocheted off the edges of the steel as I weaved the blades around , my steps quick and measured .
tr	0	' Well , they were gon na find out about us soon anyway , ' he said with a grimace .
tr	2	' You know , if Lucas doesn 't shut you up soon , I swear I 'm gon na shoot you . '
tr	4	I sheathed the swords , drew the weapons from the holsters at my hips and stepped out of the lift .
tr	0	From what I recalled of the map of the facility , Anna was being held in a room somewhere along that passage .
tr	2	A couple of men in sterile suits looked up from a monitor sitting on a desk in the room beyond .
tr	2	' I hate to rain on your touching parade here folks , but I think we should get moving , ' said Anatole .
tr	3	Anna frowned , turned to the second scientist and hit him on the jaw with the butt of the gun .
tr	0	' I will not have you question my allegiance to my race so readily , Agatha , ' she said sharply .
tr	4	At the latter 's command , Tomas Godard 's chains were removed and he was escorted inside the glass cage .
tr	4	He walked to the side of the cage , opened a compartment built in the steel construct and placed the container inside .
tr	0	' Of course , I still need to take care of your delightful granddaughter and that bastard half-breed grandson of yours .
tr	0	' If you have any feeling at all left in that cold heart of yours Agatha , then let Anna and Lucas live ! '
tr	4	I pulled up sharply , hurtled through the jagged opening and landed heavily on my feet in the middle of the shard strewn floor .
tr	4	The numbers on the indicator panel above the lintel glowed as the cabin on the left ascended into the fortress .
tr	4	A couple of minutes later , the doors of the elevator pinged open on the highest floor of the castle .
tr	4	The katana danced and skimmed through the air , blocking his moves repeatedly while I searched for a weakness in his attack .
tr	4	' Cecil and Lily managed to keep their relationship a secret for almost two hundred years , ' he continued in a weak voice .
tr	0	' I see your scar has almost faded , ' said Victor , indicating the faint mark near Reid 's left shoulder .
tr	0	Although it was not as fast as an immortal 's regenerative abilities , it was still far greater than that of a human .
tr	0	Anna assured us that such a thing has never happened on the rare occasions when a human received blood from an immortal .
tr	3	The scientists working on the project had access to only part of the materials at any one point in time . '
tr	1	' If you think we 're playing catch with this , you 've got another thing coming , ' said Reid .
tr	0	I woke up in a dark forest , with so much shadowy and very high trees that I almost saw nothing around me .
tr	4	I heard a weeping ... I went to the source and I discovered my mother , standing down , crying in a kerchief .
tr	4	Therefore , he pushed me from the cliff , while I was trying that smearing wings , which didn 't had feathers .
tr	0	I looked after him amazed how he took a cab and I was thinking to myself : " What a nitwit ! "
tr	3	" My suggestion is that you will go somewhere to drink and stay , you just simply cannot seat here in the seaport " .
tr	2	At the top of them , stood a man who took my ticket and smiled , wishing me bon voyage .
tr	3	I watched bored my phone and saw that I had only one hour left , until arriving at the destination .
tr	3	I was looking to the left and to the right , already having the intuition to return and buy me a ticket to Athens .
tr	0	For a second I feared that everything was a trick , and now I am alone on this bloody island .
tr	3	She looked at me and didn 't say a word ; she realized that with me is difficult to talk .
tr	1	I did not understand why she was so damn happy when I was so cheerless ; making plans how to murder her .
tr	2	In the elevator , I started to laugh and with a grain on my face , I looked around for my room .
tr	2	I came back in my room , took my shoes off and jumped directly in bed , felt it comfortable .
tr	3	I instead , was watching her , lost in thoughts , and I figured out that I did not know who she was .
tr	3	" We are psychologists ... I mean ... I am thinking that for the mental illnesses is the duty of the psychiatrists . "
tr	1	Me , even if I was hungry , I could not eat , only with the thought of being friend with a schizophrenic .
tr	0	I am coming home , I already miss England , and I don 't want to stay here anymore . "
tr	1	I did not care ; I have to get away from this island before I will turn myself in a schizophrenic .
tr	3	The next day , I was fresh but still angry ; an irritating state does not pass me that easily .
tr	4	" That 's why I 'm telling you Damian , that not the college can help you resolve your issues .
tr	1	A voice from my head said to me that I will be in the friend zone , which I did not like the idea .
tr	3	The subject is not allowed to know that we want to make friends with him just because we are studding him . "
tr	2	I don 't know how to dance or ... " " Don 't worry about that , I can teach you . "
tr	0	I know that he likes martial arts , is very good at it ... " " Great , a good martial arts schizophrenic . "
tr	1	She did not say hi back just : " Laurence is in his room , I will lead you the way to him .
tr	2	" Yes well ... maybe they like to travel , " I said unskillful , not knowing how to talk .
tr	1	" Hmmm , ok , only if he will have fun " she said with a disgusting smile , running in her room .
tr	3	I laugh , even if I didn 't want to do that and I watched on the bus windows , outside was twilight .
tr	1	He is schizophrenic , but I can be much worst then that and I am capable of doing conscious bad things .
tr	2	I didn 't forbid you to do that , " she said happy , taking a drink from my vodka .
tr	3	" Now yes ... I ... I went out because of that drank vodka who was showing signs that wants to get out . "
tr	4	Even if she was dizzy , still her sweet sense I could smell , and that think made me to want her so bad .
tr	4	" And what we suppose to do Damian , to seat here until the morning when our bus comes ? "
tr	1	The sky took light colors , and at the horizon , a pink line could be seen , announcing the dawn .
tr	0	I was happy , and no idea why , maybe the simple fact that I slept like a log after a long night .
tr	0	Damian E.J. " I blended the paper and I put on a blue shirt , wearing short and black jeans .
tr	1	I didn 't had nothing , my face was the same , pale with pink tint , like I knew it to be .
tr	0	Abby was standing up , happily as usual in front of me , having her hair caught in a tail .
tr	3	I did not wish to listen much to this monster ; otherwise , I would start a fight with her .
tr	3	I did not want to start believing that the girl is lying to me ; I could not stand the lie .
tr	4	We raised up from our table after drinking our coffees and we went on the road back to the hotel .
tr	0	Anyway , I make a bow at it , move along my way , making some people staring at me , and laugh .
tr	1	It was gnawing inside me knowing that she just came from Laurence and the dyeing monster did not last long , helpless struggling .
tr	1	I do not want to find out the answer of my question , but an idea was growing in my mind .
tr	2	I throw the phone on the other side of my hotel room , taking a place on the cold floor , and suffering .
tr	2	I was located in a sort of a labyrinth , with lots of doors beside me and I could hear horse tramping , somewhere .
tr	4	I felt in my knee next to her , and I pushed aside a hair strand over her beautiful face .
tr	3	The mirror 's reflection smiled at me , and I got out with that smile on my face , playing with my key .
tr	3	I didn 't want to turn around to see who called me , continuing what I started , namely to get in my room .
tr	0	When I managed to open my door and to put a step in , the voice started again to call my name .
tr	2	" I know I was , somehow rough ... but I don 't ... I don 't want to break out .
tr	0	I got up from her and took back my seat on the chair , same as I was before , impassible .
tr	1	I write on it legible " For Abigail Woods " and after that , I made a smile face right next .
tr	2	I got up slowly from the bed , like I was sick or something and go lazily to the bathroom .
tr	0	I took my black purse and I searched in it , taking in my hand wrappings and throw them in the garbage .
tr	3	I turn white and my knee started to shake ; in that moments I felt a left over , abandoned , lost .
tr	3	I just wanted to scream , that how much angry I was , still trying to call him but he still didn 't answer .
tr	0	After all my mascara was gone , I started to put a new and fresh makeup , being careful too not ruin again .
tr	2	If you are Helen who reads this , I have something to say to you : Go to Hell ! "
tr	2	I really didn 't know how to react , I was sad of course , mad on him that he left without saying goodbye .
tr	3	" I really suck at romantic things , but I wanted to make a special night just for two of us . "
tr	3	Somehow , I wanted to cry , to get out from the car and to run back to the hotel .
tr	4	I could hear his breath , somehow accelerated , the sea , which was breaking the waves to the beach .
tr	3	Abby , I 'm that kind of guy who doesn 't like to pass to a girl then next to the other .
tr	4	In that moment , I looked around to see from which was the note , and then I saw her .
tr	4	Probably was a public bath , but I really needed one , especially that I drank wine and the sea was making everything worse .
tr	2	And he was trying to stop him coming above , but I was to damn curious about him , thirsty of knowing .
tr	1	He was standing in my front and I could feel his anger , as if Laurence had an evil twin brother .
tr	3	I took out a little mirror from my purse and start to clean myself with a towel , filling it with blood .
tr	0	I was on a date and I end up raped and abandoned on the beach , can you please come and take me ? "
tr	4	I was more reserved , because I was talking with my subject 's father and in the same time with my boyfriend 's father .
tr	2	Mr. Mill or Jay , how he forced me to call him , took a seat right next to me on the white sofa .
tr	1	" I 'm sorry Lars , I was ... " " In love with you my son , didn 't you get it ?
tr	2	" Oh my God , Abby , we have to take you to a hospital and to call the police . "
tr	2	" I know I was , somehow rough ... but I don 't ... I don 't want to break out .
tr	2	On the road , my mind was flying to Damian , how honestly he could tell me that I love you .
tr	1	I took him out from me a while ago , when I isolated myself , after I found out that my girlfriend died . "
tr	0	" I promise to you , Abigail Woods , that no matter what will happen , Alex will stay locked away . "
tr	0	I came back with my mind , being in Laurence arms , on the back seat of his parent 's car .
tr	3	We got into the first taxi , which arrived , and Helen took the front seat right next to the driver .
tr	4	I just wanted to smack my forehead , but why should I punish myself when I should smack her to come back to reality .
tr	3	" I wasn 't pretending , just that I was laying down a little bit because I had a little car sick . "
tr	2	From a near house , a woman got closer to us , but wasn 't dressed in black but in open colors . "
tr	3	What I loved the most about that room was the window in the ceiling , which was a little inclined after the ceiling form .
tr	3	I would fell much better if I would know the truth and in this way I would enjoy the trip with you . "
tr	2	Lars got a little dizzy from drinking ; therefore , I took him up into our room , laying him on the bed .
tr	4	She handed me a glass with hot chocolate , and she took a seat next to me on the bench .
tr	0	I easily can say that I 'm about so close to blow the all project away , going with my future carrier .
tr	4	The reason he is closer to Laurence 's condition , let 's name it problem , is because his father . "
tr	1	" Nobody said that this thing how called it , is a matter of magic or science fiction , my dear .
tr	1	" I am so sorry , I 'm a little scared that I 'm here talking with Damian 's father in my mind . "
tr	0	My family was royalty , but I have quite that life , I fall in love with Kate , Damian 's mother . "
tr	1	" When you will wake up , you will find it in your pocket , with the address written on it .
tr	4	I was already starting to regret the day I met him , and the impatience was rising upper and upper .
tr	1	I said to her , and I pushed her inside , hitting her head on the mirror , cracking it .
tr	0	" Meaning that I am a student at psychology , and I had a project here , to study a mental illness case .
tr	4	The British city was very crowded even at the airport , with many people trying to run away from the cruel weather .
tr	3	I wanted so bad to arrive at the destination with the taxi , no matter how much euros would cost me .
tr	1	I didn 't know what I should tell Damian , in the moment I will meet him , I really didn 't know .
tr	0	Maybe wasn 't such a good idea to visit him , and I was guided just by a silly dream , a plan .
tr	3	I sighed and putted my hood on my head , to not be soaking wet until I will get to him .
tr	1	I felt the blood rushing throw my veins , giving me emotions and fearing in some way my meeting with him .
tr	2	I didn 't say a word , only looking again around , hoping to see Damian 's face popping from a corner .
tr	1	Mrs. Jones just sighed , probably thinking that was a good idea and I sensed perfectly , because she stood up and said .
tr	0	Said Mrs. Jones , taking away my thought to Laurence and making me watch an old white and brown building .
tr	1	When I saw him , I jumped in the air , and looked at him with my eyes swimming in tears .
tr	3	Didn 't last long and the nurse told us that the visiting is over , so we had to leave .
tr	4	Any resemblance to actual events , locales , organizations , or persons , living or deceased , is entirely coincidental .
tr	0	Many a child would be happy for a warm bed and supper to eat , Miss Miriam , so away with you . "
tr	4	She climbed up to her room as slowly as she dared , watched by Nelly with her fists on her hips .
tr	2	She took the tray of food -- a leg of chicken and some tapioca pudding - and put it in the closet .
tr	2	She locked her door so no one could come in and rattled the door to make certain it was shut tight .
tr	0	Her father 's " Writing Ball , " which she had purloined from his study right after his death , had always fascinated her .
tr	0	He put down the bag , sat on the low couch , and picked up a wineglass and a decanter .
tr	3	The two boys ' eyes brightened at the sight of the food , and Simon sat as close as possible to the tray .
tr	2	Outside , there was a sound of rushing wind , followed by a long , drawn-out whistle from a passing train .
tr	2	Miriam tried to shout for Mrs. Williams , or for Furnace , or for someone , but no sound emerged .
tr	1	Simon and Neil , clutching a napkin filled with buns and apples , opened a glass door and crashed onto one of the courtyards .
tr	3	He found a bit of driftwood and banged it against the taller rocks edging the sands , trying to break it in half .
tr	3	Its position put him right in front of the circle ; its diameter was taller than his head by about a foot .
tr	0	Her back was to Miriam , so the girl darted in , grabbed a piece of bread from a plate and darted out again .
tr	0	Miriam vaguely heard the maid mutter to herself , " Indian tea , and black coffee , and a pot of chocolate .
tr	1	The woman turned a brick red , but whether it was from embarrassment or anger , Miriam couldn 't tell .
tr	4	But the man behind the desk put down the document he had been reading , stood up and came forward .
tr	1	And she will stay there without supper or tea until she says she is sorry to my husband and me . "
tr	2	I entirely forgot I wanted her moved out of her bedroom so that it could be prepared and fumigated for our son !
tr	1	I only meant that we should show some spirit of kindness to Pearson 's daughter , or people might start asking questions . "
tr	0	" And it is a dashed awkward time for people to ask questions , if you take my meaning . "
tr	4	Mrs. Williams sighed and shook her head as she crumbled the uneaten bread and threw it out for the birds .
tr	2	" Theodosia , do you know how expensive it will be if we cannot go through with the project ? "
tr	1	No namby-pamby idiot taking that child 's side and spoiling her or giving her ideas above her station , do you hear me ? "
tr	4	In the library , Virgil felt his head begin to whirl as the day of interviews stretched from one , to two , three .
tr	0	The girl had begun to look and smell like a dirty orphan , if what the servants said was true .
tr	3	By God , they might be living at the back of nowhere , but that cook certainly knew how to bake !
tr	3	In fact , I knew Mr. Pearson himself , when he first came out to my country to start his concerns . "
tr	4	Her collar and cuffs were starched , and not a single hair escaped from the comb on her braided coronet .
tr	3	" Not just bread and water , judging from the look of you , " Mana retorted , pointing to the jam stain .
tr	1	" Because she wants me to , and I 'm not going to do anything she wants me to , " Miriam announced triumphantly .
tr	1	" You mean you think I could stop my aunt and uncle -- I mean my guardians -- from taking over the company ? "
tr	2	" For one , it would be the most appalling bad manners , and for another , it would get you nowhere . "
tr	2	" We 'll go down and you can apologize to your guardians , and I 'll have some decent food sent upstairs .
tr	2	No more pickles or cheese or sandwiches from Mr. Furnace ; you 'll want a good rice pudding or some semolina . "
tr	1	" More importantly , it is the start of your having some decent manners and not antagonizing everyone in the house . "
tr	0	The girl was as clean and neat as a new pin , and she carried a tray of dirty plates .
tr	4	Virgil , his feet propped up on the table , swirled a large glass of amber liquid under his nose .
tr	0	As Miriam and Mana walked in , he looked up , gave an exclamation , and hurriedly swung his feet to the floor .
tr	1	Tomorrow we will begin lessons , and I will assist in the removal of Miriam 's things to the attics .
tr	0	She wanted to get upstairs as soon as she could and question Mana about how she had handled Aunt Theodosia .
tr	3	After they had eaten , she told Miriam to get her coat and hat so they could take a walk outside .
tr	0	You can learn a poem by heart when we come back , and that should do it for today . "
tr	4	The rhythm seemed to gallop as well , and after a bit , Miriam found that her feet were tapping out the words .
tr	3	" Well , that 's not so bad in that case , although it might not go over in the royal drawing room .
tr	2	" Your bedroom is right up those steps , so we won 't have to traipse up and down the main hall anymore . "
tr	0	" But that was my bedroom -- that I have always slept in -- since my father was here . "
tr	3	At the top there was a narrow hall that divided the top story into two sides , lined with doors .
tr	2	The ceiling sloped close to the floor , and the late afternoon sun shone in through two dormer windows with window seats .
tr	1	That night , Miriam lay in her new room , sleepily thinking to herself about the quick glimpse she had of Simon .
tr	0	Maybe she 'll teach me the language of her island ... A faraway whistle sounded and rose to a thin wail .
tr	1	" All I know is that I had to move all the furniture in Miss Miriam 's room , " George said .
tr	1	" It would be her doing the hiring , that thin woman ; she 's always popping her long nose into everything . "
tr	3	" Oh , it 's you , " she said , sitting down in front of the table laid with tea things .
tr	0	" No tea for me , thank you , Miriam , " Mana spoke with great firmness and cut off Theodosia 's shocked denial .
tr	4	" It 's about a princess whose father dies , and she 's walled up in a tower made of ice ! "
tr	4	After that first meeting , the boy was hustled away from Miriam whenever there was a chance of a meeting .
tr	1	Miriam sulked for a bit and ate as quickly as she could , hoping to get back to lessons so she could finish sooner .
tr	0	Taking Miriam 's coat , Mana opened the cloakroom , a funny little chamber under the stairs that smelled of deckchairs .
tr	0	Indeed , the poem was rather long , but it was about a strange country with icy caverns and wailing maidens .
tr	2	" Honest , it 's not in my room -- you know , Simon 's new room -- or anything like that . "
tr	4	" I 'd have to get dressed for tea , " he added , gasping , " in my velvet suit . "
tr	2	Simon watched before he picked up one of his own books and opened it ; he was soon absorbed in his own work .
tr	1	" Here you are , " he said , sitting up , " if you want it so badly . "
tr	0	He looked back at Miriam and made a hideous face at her , and she thrust her tongue out at him .
tr	3	He had added them up at least five times already , but he erased his totals and started to tot them up again .
tr	0	Pearson had been a bloody millionaire , and yet most of that cash was untouchable , tied up in trusts for his daughter .
tr	1	Finally she turned to him and asked , " You think it is the only way we can gain the money ? "
tr	1	" I 'll start the process tomorrow , " he said , " just as soon as I see Fortescue .
tr	0	Somewhat subdued , Miriam gathered up her pencils , and Mana went down to arrange a picnic lunch with Mrs. Williams .
tr	1	" Yes , I think it does , " Miriam said , and set off down the path , skipping and singing to herself .
tr	3	" Take off your shoes and stockings , " Mana ordered , putting the picnic basket on the widest , flattest rock .
tr	0	An anomaly of the salt air and the distance of the reef made them appear to float in the air over the dark sea .
tr	4	" Put the jar in the water while you look , " Mana ordered from the side , " to keep him cool .
tr	1	And the mistress wants me to sort out the cupboards in the rooms -- which rooms she didn 't say . "
tr	2	Mrs. Williams opened the window and roared at him , " Don 't you know how to use a door ? "
tr	3	" If they find out that I lifted that yolk I 'll lose my position and no bones about it ! "
tr	0	Although , anyone could have told her that pearls that large , and that lustrous , would have been worth a king 's ransom .
tr	3	Her hand went up to the tightly rolled cushions of her hair , and Miriam realized that Aunt Theodosia found Mr. Cantwell very attractive .
tr	4	" My home , such as it is , " he answered , " is the one place where I can truly be myself .
tr	1	" Really , Virgil , " Theodosia said in her snapping tone , " our guest will think we are interrogating him . "
tr	1	She knew she was going to hear all about the winning of her , later on from Simon and Neil .
tr	3	" Miriam , " Theodosia said , " I think perhaps that it is time that you went back to the schoolroom . "
tr	4	The girl picked up her pen , thought for a minute , and composed a new paragraph in her mind .
tr	4	Mana , picking up another book from the table where they did lessons , glanced at Miriam and followed her gaze .
tr	2	Miriam looked up from her plate , and flew to the window in time to see Mr. Cantwell coming out of the woods .
tr	4	Cantwell , appearing to be satisfied that no one could see him , left the park and headed for the back of the house .
tr	3	" I suppose I could , if I wanted to play my entire hand right at the start , " she said .
tr	4	Do her hair properly today , please ; I don 't want her looking as wild as she did yesterday . "
tr	3	Watching them , Miriam thought with a rising tide of exultation that Mana was wrong ; they were all pretty stupid .
tr	0	All she and Mana had to do was to sit tight and watch them closely , and soon they 'd reveal what they wanted .
tr	1	He saw Miriam and rolled his eyes at her , plainly intimating , " Oh , no , not another one . "
tr	1	" I do not , " Mana responded instantly , " even if such a word were in my vocabulary . "
tr	1	I was furious when they came , and I still do not like Aunt Theodosia , but Uncle Virgil is just silly .
tr	4	He lets her get away with the most embarrassing scenes , because he 's afraid of her , I think .
tr	3	" I thought my father was bad , but really he was just nonexistent , until he died , that is .
tr	2	She paused as Neil was offered a bowl of hot water , which he obviously didn 't know how to handle .
tr	0	After surviving the fiasco of the formal dinner , he had relaxed in Mana 's company and was actually enjoying himself .
tr	1	" My response should be something fitting to a governess , such as ' At least you have parents ' .
tr	4	First , there will be the trusts , which have proven simple enough until now but which may be more complicated later .
tr	0	Miriam twisted away from him , but Simon managed to get an arm around her and snatch the paper away .
tr	1	Simon held the paper out to Miriam , and she thrust it back it him as if it were a live snake .
tr	0	Simon frowned and reached out a hand to catch her arm again , but she slipped away and disappeared back into the house .
tr	1	" Good afternoon , Miss Cantwell , " Theodosia said , hurrying forward and stretching out one hand in greeting .
tr	2	" You could go to the city with Virgil when you have to visit the Company , and I could show Barbara around . "
tr	0	Barbara 's smart suit contrasted drastically with Theodosia 's own clothes , which were in varying shades of ill-advised lavender .
tr	0	" Hold on , " he hissed back , pausing until Barbara , Simon and his mother had moved on a bit .
tr	1	" I have lost it , " Simon said , smiling to himself in what Neil thought was an extremely unintelligent manner .
tr	3	" I wanted to sit next to Simon or Neil , but Simon was too busy turning pages for that sister .
tr	0	" I know the sea , and -- " " There are other ways of travelling , " Mana said .
tr	1	" Make certain that you do absolutely nothing that would raise any doubts in anyone 's mind about our innocence , " she said .
tr	4	We have a secret plot , mind control , those weird circles on the beach -- " " What circles on the beach ? "
tr	0	" Now that Simon has gone all peculiar over that Barbara female , you and I can observe them instead . "
tr	1	" Very well , " Miriam said , unwilling to forgive him , but longing to know what he was talking about .
tr	0	" We were talking about that cup of coffee , " Miriam shot back , " and how it was meant for Neil . "
tr	0	Chapter 18 Mana 's Wooden Comb ana had her wooden comb out again , teasing the tangles out of Miriam 's hair .
tr	3	" To tell you the truth , I have been counting the days left until Simon returns to school , " she finally said .
tr	3	" You couldn 't do better than that -- it is a figure that must be more than twice your yearly salary ! "
tr	4	Miriam sat frozen between them , feeling as if she were in the middle of some silent battle of wills .
tr	2	One day , very soon , we will all be rich ; not just well-to-do , but hopelessly , disgustingly wealthy . "
tr	2	What I wanted to tell you was to not worry about her ; there are always ways of ridding yourself of boring annoyances . "
tr	0	" Don 't worry about me , Theo , " Valiant said , waving one cigar lazily from the depths of an armchair .
tr	0	Miriam sobbed , and fought to escape as a pair of arms encircled her from behind -- Valiant was holding her back .
tr	0	" Better hang on to your admirer , Barbara , " Valiant said , blowing out a long stream of smoke .
tr	1	" Still , it is a bit annoying , especially now -- " She stopped talking as Valiant waved his cigar at Miriam .
tr	0	It seemed incredibly old , but the wood was almost as hard as stone and hadn 't cracked at all .
tr	2	Miriam looked around her attic room , but she couldn 't think of a secret nook where she could tuck it away .
tr	2	If only she could have thought of something clever to say , or have found some way to help Mana !
tr	0	She heard the sound of a striking match , and a small light flared up , showing Simon and Neil .
tr	1	Miriam hopped in beside him , and Neil plunged into the dark stables , waving away Miriam 's offer of help .
tr	2	" Simon wanted to rush downstairs as soon as we heard someone creeping about , without stopping to change . "
tr	4	At least that sack wasn 't over her eyes anymore , but her hands and feet were still securely tied .
tr	1	In front of her on the ground , lay Simon , his eyes closed and his head tilted back at a funny angle .
tr	4	" Well , let 's just shout and make them understand they 've got the wrong people , " Simon said .
tr	4	The door opened after a few minutes of shouting and a guard pushed his head in to glare at them .
tr	2	" Listen , my good man , you 've got hold of the wrong people , " Simon said confidently .
tr	1	" Please , sir , " she said , giving him a winning smile , " my arms hurt ever so much .
tr	1	Straightening up with some difficulty , the guard walked away , stowing Miriam 's money and the food in one pocket .
tr	2	" And , it 's more than you were able to do , being all posh and trying to order people about .
tr	2	" And once we get to where we 're going , do try not to call anyone ' my good man ' . "
tr	4	Well , I can 't just lie here with those doings underneath me she reasoned and got out of bed .
tr	4	And once , she had found the gold sovereign that her father had buried and forgotten , just by walking over the spot .
tr	2	She turned to go , and stubbed her toe painfully on something left out on the floor of the room .
tr	3	At that point they would realize that their son had left them for good , perhaps taking his two rich friends with him .
tr	4	There had been something very defenseless about the way Mana had been sitting in the cart beside the drunken , singing driver .
tr	1	As the rough wood bit into his blisters , he admonished himself , " Don 't complain , you big useless idiot .
tr	2	Neil wouldn 't have known which leg to throw over a horse and would probably end up sitting facing its bottom .
tr	3	The wind smacked the boat again , and he had to grab the oars so they wouldn 't slide into the water .
tr	0	Like a bull charging at a red cloak , the next gust of wind hit him in the back and nearly pitched him forward .
tr	4	Neil flopped onto his back and covered his face , and after a while he slid into an uncomfortable sleep .
tr	0	Her mouth moved , and although Neil couldn 't hear her words , somehow he knew what she was trying to say .
tr	0	There it was again -- and suddenly Neil knew what it was he was hearing -- the hiss of waves on a beach .
tr	0	His hand suddenly touched something hard , and he realized that he had reached a hard , wet stretch of sand .
tr	0	One narrow hand pushed back the dark curtain that hung in front of her eyes , and he saw that it was a girl .
tr	0	Neil staggered to his feet and almost fell again , but the skinny arm wound around his waist and supported him .
tr	4	The rocky slope on one side created a natural border , and the other side was hemmed in by a stone wall .
tr	4	The thin hand tugged on his sleeve , and he turned to see the girl who had rescued him beside an older woman .
tr	0	Riki pushed past him and ran upstairs , hopped onto the banister and slid down , and pushed her way up again .
tr	4	The lid opened to an array of fine cotton shirts , folded neatly among small bags of herbs to keep them smelling sweet .
tr	4	He hopped out of bed and went over to the bath , which was huge and circular , like the bed .
tr	0	He also had to tell her that he had to push on , once he had paid his debt to her .
tr	3	You try getting lost in a storm and almost dying of thirst and see how clean you are after , " he retorted .
tr	0	" Well , that 's a polite way of putting it , " Neil said , bobbing his head awkwardly at the huge man .
tr	4	Neil ladled a few onto his plate and hurriedly passed the bowl to Riki , who began to pile them onto her own platter .
tr	3	We can go to the market to see who can steal the most fruit , and the loser has to buy lunch . "
tr	2	She took one of his hands in both of her own and shook it up and down for several moments .
tr	4	After breakfast , they set off across the lawn and turned in the opposite direction from which Neil had originally arrived .
tr	0	The sea was also extremely warm ; in fact , it was just like wading through clear , salty , crystal soup .
tr	1	I suppose it 's a good idea actually , since we can finish lunch while we wait for them to bite . "
tr	0	He huffed , catching his breath , and finally managed to say , " Oh , no , I 'm not marrying you .
tr	0	A small orange crab waved a claw at Riki , and a bright blue one nipped at Neil 's finger .
tr	4	Neil opened his mouth to ask her about this phenomenon , but Riki forestalled him with a hand on his sleeve .
tr	3	" But , I really want to go and see those mountains , the -- what did you call them ?
tr	3	" Look , " he said , " let 's just climb up and scout out the territory a bit .
tr	2	" We won 't get in trouble for going so close to the king 's lands , will we ? "
tr	2	That was topped by a third floor , and the roof was scrolled and inlaid with what looked like mother of pearl .
tr	0	Fantastic creatures guarded each corner of the roof -- a dragon , a sea serpent and a merman blowing into a golden shell .
tr	0	The palace was situated at the bottom of the mountain 's foothills , and between it and hills was a large , sparkling lagoon .
tr	0	As unobtrusively as possible , Neil edged away from that large knife and tried to look as mild and as law-abiding as possible .
tr	3	He gestured with his stick towards the lagoon below them and turned away towards the palace , motioning for them to follow .
tr	0	" He says to stay away from the mountains , " Riki said , " and to go home fast . "
tr	3	The path twisted , and he was cut off from the sound of the water lapping on the lagoon shore .
tr	2	If she got lost now , or ran back to that guard , or got arrested , he would be held responsible .
tr	4	One thing that you could say about Riki , Neil reflected ; she had an easy temperament and forgot her anger quickly .
tr	0	" I was glad to have -- that is , I 'm glad that you and Riki had such a pleasant day . "
tr	4	Riki continued to stare up at her mother after that hurried speech , but her face crumpled and she yawned hugely .
tr	3	We thought she would get better once she got older , but -- " " But it got worse . "
tr	3	The figure was that of a woman with long , matted hair and torn clothes , and the stink emanated from her .
tr	4	She smiled with closed eyes , as though she was lost in a wonderful place that no one else could see .
tr	1	The girl was now flinging her wild hair from side to side , and her humming had escalated to moans .
tr	1	Neil used to do the same thing , two lifetimes ago , in the fishing village with his sisters and his father .
tr	2	In the pool , a small octopus emerged from the shadow of a rock and started to stalk a shrimp .
tr	3	He was certain that if a rumor had started to go around about the tunnel being haunted , something was happening there .
tr	4	Simon , Miriam and Mana were doomed , and his parents and family would be prosecuted and turned out of their house .
tr	3	We overheard the girls telling that story on the beach , and it just makes sense that you would want to go and investigate .
tr	0	He reached out one arm and brushed back her hair ( done in untidy braids , as usual ) with one hand .
tr	0	After being washed and laid onto clean sheets in a cool , darkened room , the girl had finally fallen into a natural sleep .
tr	4	The thick jungle , filled during the day with the calling of the parrots overhead , was now quiet and dark .
tr	4	She grabbed his hand and threaded her way down the path , nearing the area where the large guard had left them before .
tr	4	He concentrated on walking as silently as possible , and he nearly bumped into her when she suddenly froze and squeezed his hand .
tr	3	Yuck , he thought , as the smoke wafted towards him ; blow me down if I ever take up that particular habit .
tr	2	I appreciate that you want your own profits soon , but we have to abide by our country 's laws , my dear fellow .
tr	2	" Once production is in place and we really get rolling , do you realize how rich we 'll all be ?
tr	3	And , that 's not taking into account the nasty tariffs and import costs and the recent wars in the Orient .
tr	4	Of the three men who Neil had just listened to , the guard had seemed to make the most sense .
tr	0	I just can 't wait to go home , have a bath and drink a big cup of wine . "
tr	1	Something hideous slimed its way over Neil 's ankle , and he bit his lip in order not to shout with disgust .
tr	0	His hand touched something solid and warm , and with a start he realized that he was holding Riki 's ankle .
tr	0	The hole was pitch dark as well , until Riki struck a match and a small point of light flared up .
tr	2	I don 't know where they are now ; I just sort of jumped into a boat and followed you here .
tr	0	A moment later he and Riki heard the same unearthly wail that had frightened them so badly in the passageway .
tr	4	" I 'll be fine , " she said , and one corner of her mouth lifted in a smile .
tr	3	There was a slight thud as it hit the bars , and Mana hooked it with one hand and drew it into the cage .
tr	2	If he ever got big enough , he would pay them out for that ; you could bet on it .
tr	4	She stepped onto the first one without any hesitation , and Neil , feeling a bit ashamed , followed her carefully .
tr	2	For one heart stopping moment Neil thought that he would slip and fall down onto the wicked , sharp rocks below him .
tr	2	If we put him in a good mood , for example , by you being absolutely , positively on your best behavior . "
tr	0	This led to telling about Miriam , and Simon , and how they had all met at Miriam 's house .
tr	4	The only thing he could say for certain about her was that when Mana said something , he believed it with no hesitation whatsoever .
tr	0	He wanted breakfast as badly as she did , but he did not want to risk another confrontation with any of the palace goons .
tr	1	In his room , he had scrubbed until he tingled , but his nails were still dirty , he saw now .
tr	3	It 's just like listening to a Royal Address or the bishop 's sermon with these two , Neil thought .
tr	1	The thing is , Miriam and Simon were kidnapped and put on a train going somewhere in the middle of the night . "
tr	2	" My cook is not going to run off with you on some fool errand -- " " Father ! "
tr	4	She somewhat ruined the dutiful daughter image she had created earlier by leaping into the air and crashing down on Neil 's foot .
tr	4	It is the eve of some new business venture , or some such thing , and he is inviting everyone to the Palace .
tr	0	You 'll probably wear that maroon caftan of yours again , the one that everyone liked at the last party at the palace . "
tr	4	Riki 's eyes met Neil 's and they raised their eyebrows in mutual surprise that her mother had said such a thing .
tr	4	You tell them about your own project because you need their help , and they take over the whole thing .
tr	1	" I must say , sir , " Neil said , " Riki 's a lot of good on an expedition .
tr	3	We don 't know if the link that attaches it to this rock is strong enough to bear your weight .
tr	4	His pose was negligent , but something about his tensed , powerful shoulders gave the impression that he would spring into action if necessary .
tr	3	He had accomplished something that he had set out to do , and his flight wasn 't a terrible waste after all .
tr	3	A short time later , Riki and Neil sat in the front veranda , poking crusts of yesterday 's rolls at an unenthusiastic parrot .
tr	1	Perhaps the bird sensed the oncoming storm , as it turned its back on Riki and began to nibble under one wing .
tr	0	My father was a sailor and a fisherman , and I know a rain cloud when I see one . "
tr	3	" I got caught in that storm because I wanted to save my friends and didn 't pay attention to the weather !
tr	3	" I just wanted to know what you think , if you don 't mind , " Neil said to her through his teeth .
tr	3	Machi , if that was the fellow 's name , barked something to the other guards and they all trooped upstairs .
tr	1	Reluctantly , he picked up a roll topped with honey and crunchy nuts and bit into it , sunk in gloom .
tr	2	He got up quickly and moved out of temptation 's way to one of the benches , which was made of highly polished wood .
tr	3	" But she is much better now ; in fact , she made that almond cake that you 're eating now . "
tr	0	" I 'm afraid that you and your family will have to come with us as well , " he said .
tr	0	You are an honorable man , and I 'm certain you will respect the sacred laws of our country . "
tr	4	I still had my keys to the inner rooms from my time as a temple maiden , before we were married . "
tr	1	" I can 't see , my dear , with you in the window , " he said in a mild tone .
tr	2	Oh yes , there 's some sort of clown , or magician , or something -- no , there 's two of them . "
tr	0	The boatman raised a pole and pushed off , joining a trail of boats that floated towards the Palace , illuminated by hanging lanterns .
tr	4	Another monk threw back his robe and pointed at the palace guards , who stopped , perplexed , when they saw him .
tr	0	" Stop it at once , " Mana ordered , raising one arm and pointing at the guards grouped behind Machi .
tr	1	" I am the queen in name only until I can bring the Glorious Corona back to the islands , " Mana said .
tr	0	" We have an extremely important job to do -- one that impacts a country , a company and several families .
tr	3	He stood up and offered a large hand to Neil , who , after an instant 's hesitation , took it .
tr	0	Neil cleared his throat and asked , " What are we going to do on the mainland , Mana ? "
tr	1	She was born in Arizona and has also lived in Pennsylvania , Illinois , Mexico , Ireland , and Spain .
tr	3	She folded her arms against her stomach and thought about a story she wanted to write when she got off the train .
tr	2	He looked out of the doorway and shouted to some unseen companion , " Bring the lot of them in !
tr	2	The dark haired man nodded and said , " I didn 't expect no more than a pig 's squeal .
tr	2	As soon as we arrive at our destination , we 'll let a person of authority know of the error .
tr	4	" Shouldn 't doubt you 'll be there the rest of your days , running the mills and sweeping the floors . "
tr	0	He had a scar that ran right down his face , from eye to chin , that snaked across nose and mouth .
tr	4	Simon put a hand on her sleeve and whispered , " That must be the one who is in control here .
tr	0	Her hair , what there was of it , was scraped back from a face so bony as to appear skinless and bloodless .
tr	2	They lumbered towards Frank and gripped him with huge hands , and pulled him into the dark , brick building .
tr	4	The Headmistress ignored her and put a whistle that hung around her neck on a silver string to her lips .
tr	4	" You don 't have to squeeze me , " she said , exasperated , and she tried to shake his hand off .
tr	0	Miriam was hauled out of the tub and dried with a stiff towel that looked more like a piece of an old oats bag .
tr	0	Giving it up as a bad job , Miriam walked into the cell and the door was closed on her .
tr	3	His little home was away from the rest of the community , tucked into the low hills surrounding the village .
tr	4	Their labors began in a leisurely manner as they worked with great skill weaving the thatched roof back into a fine carpet .
tr	3	I haven 't thought of it for a long time and then last night , the memory came back in a dream .
tr	2	You sit up here in the hollows and don 't know of the rumors , rumors of a man clad in crimson .
tr	3	He was so excited he stood in his boat to call out , lost his balance and fell into the water .
tr	0	Beside it was a common oak chair and a rather large rocker made from a wood he could not put a name to .
tr	2	" Yes , I know of the rumors , and of you knowing of them , well , that is another matter .
tr	2	He couldn 't hold back his excitement and burst through the door barreling down the wet , muddy fields toward his old friend .
tr	4	I think you are confused , that maybe you have inhaled the night airs too deeply and have a bug up your nose . "
tr	3	He told them of its origins in the north and some of its history , at least as much as he knew .
tr	3	If at that time it was satisfactory , it was bottled and stored for use , mainly at festive gatherings .
tr	3	Long ago it was separated from the cane , and the time has come to return it to its rightful place .
tr	3	Their lord has sent forth mouths to give his terms to my king and those kings of the other northern lands .
tr	2	The quest was not of my choosing , though for my king I would most surely have accepted his charge .
tr	3	After the great wars in the south the men and their kind withdrew to the north and all the surrounding lands .
tr	2	It was long before written records of our peoples had been charted and thus it was passed only through word of mouth .
tr	3	" Are you two coming or are you just going to stand there and waste the rest of this beautiful day ? "
tr	4	At that they picked up their pace , the scenery again passing quickly as the morning sun began its march across the blue sky .
tr	4	He was not accustomed to large groups ; a man of solitude he was concerned with too many eyes knowing of his presence .
tr	2	Those who did not know or understand , through no fault or malice , could cause him the most harm .
tr	0	A farmer by trade he saw no use for that particular crop , nothing more than an annoying weed , he thought .
tr	0	Most of the area was saturated from the spring thaw and the rain that had come in the past few days .
tr	4	The long walk made them work up a sweat and the sudden lack of movement caused them to cool down quickly .
tr	1	Their pace was quicker than it had been in the morning and it was now Mr. Clancy who grew impatient .
tr	4	He knew he would have to make his best speed ; he had no desire to let down his new friend .
tr	3	Our most direct route would be to cut straight through the heart of the basin and turn into the far , southwestern end .
tr	0	They had guided him this far and though he could have gotten here without them , he was in their debt .
tr	4	They scurried around for fresh fruits to accompany the dried meats they had brought ; the cooking pan being unneeded was quickly packed away .
tr	3	" I saw them in my dreams last night , though I was unsure when we would contact them . "
tr	0	" Mr. Clancy , have you been ... " He grabbed Clancy and began dragging him back into the woods .
tr	2	A black arrow stood straight up from his left shoulder , covered in blood , the shaft broken in the middle .
tr	4	He had been in this area before and was sure , almost sure , he knew exactly where he was .
tr	0	From his bag he took a lump of coal and some flint and quickly had a small fire driving away the shadows .
tr	4	They were frozen at the edge of the cave , never before having had their lives threatened , too afraid to move .
tr	0	He stared at the bandage as a snarl came across his face , almost as if he had taken the arrow himself .
tr	4	He had taken the middle watch and since he had little sleep the night before he welcomed the precious slumber .
tr	2	" This quest of yours has been brought to my lands and injury has now come to one of our own .
tr	0	What of all this talk of powerful crystals and men changing shape and flying off to who knows where through the skies ?
tr	0	All they could see was a large scab and a black bruise front and back , the path the arrow had taken .
tr	2	I would gladly end my own life rather than live under their foul lords " " How long will we wait ? "
tr	4	As they crawled from the thick brush and dusted the earth from their garments a light wind brushed across their faces .
tr	0	He must fear a great assault upon his realm and can wait no longer for the crystal to be found . "
tr	4	You have come to the southern end of the Dream Valley and here your oath of service to my quest ends .
tr	0	It was as high as any in this part of the range , though there were higher and more dangerous far to the north .
tr	3	There is a war to be won , my friends , and this was your first taste of battle . "
tr	3	I know how long you have waited for this moment but this is not the time , nor the place .
tr	2	The two grizzled thugs stood eye to eye as neither could afford to back down in front of his own .
tr	1	There will be no fire for us this night ; it would give away our hiding place , such as it is . "
tr	3	It is with all the hope I can muster that they will pass your lands , but I do not think that will happen .
tr	4	Those that behold the crystal shall know its true purpose if goodness reigns in their hearts and their souls are pure . "
tr	0	It was as if I was in a deep sleep , though I knew what was going on around me .
tr	0	How could this happen to their , to his , beautiful land , the land he had grown up playing in ?
tr	3	It is too far to run though that would be our best chance , but we must conserve our strength .
tr	4	This poor excuse for a soldier ; how could he have let them force these pitiful little creatures on him ?
tr	0	He rolled as he landed and was caught against the side of a large root jutting out from a blackened oak .
tr	4	They cleaned the site so there would be no trace of death only that which had already been brought to this place .
tr	4	" I have not though it sounds like the words of old I heard in my travels in the northern realms .
tr	0	He cleared his lungs with a few short breaths then filled his chest enough to blast out a mighty roar .
tr	3	It was more than the first could withstand and it fell limply to the earth below unseen as it passed below the treetops .
tr	4	If the one that remains is not , and I know not what it could be , our quest has ended here .
tr	0	It was the curtain of light facing the wastelands that had kept them at bay all these ages and now it had vanished .
tr	4	The specter of the power of men had been lessened and they believed it was time to strike and the invasion began anew . "
tr	4	Everything was left as they had found it and they slid down the east side of the hill into the darkness .
tr	0	The collective groan could be heard all around as the blast from a carved horn of a black ram cut through the night airs .
tr	1	I have only known this feeling once , long ago , in our journeys far in the north together . "
tr	3	The trail though easily seen in the darkness was lined with rough ground and large rocks that thrust upward at their tired feet .
tr	0	They would make their way north on the fringes of the mountains as far as the black army would allow .
tr	0	Most of his journeys had taken him north into and above the flatlands , but he was still a well-traveled and salty individual .
tr	1	It is high praise indeed coming from one such as you , but I am in need of your advice .
tr	4	He could not be certain the strength of the patrols on their chosen course so they would have to be careful .
tr	4	That is the place of our enemy , but we will crush them and their evil deeds of the past shall not go unpunished .
tr	4	Tall and lean were they with hoods cloaking their faces , or what should be faces if they indeed had any .
tr	2	This next decision shall be yours and for my part , I will follow you as you have followed me . "
tr	4	Only the telltale sign of smoke lingering in the motionless airs told the real story of his once proud dwelling .
tr	1	He picked up the final sword lifting it high into the morning airs , a sliver of light glancing off the steel blade .
tr	1	They used the forest as cover as long as it was available , dashing for short sprints from clump to clump when it broke .
tr	4	Mr. Clancy made his way to the edge and in the remaining light looked out over the land he once called his home .
tr	1	Mr. Clancy turned and walked slowly back to the rear and sat down with his head hung low in utter numbness .
tr	0	Qualities he had found in Clancy those many years ago had come again to the surface in these two brave souls .
tr	3	He rose and turned to face them and the shadow walked to his side into the light of the starry night .
tr	4	They returned to the face of the cliff and prepared for a night 's sleep , one that was desperately needed by all .
tr	3	* * * They all slept well that night though they wished it could have lasted a few turns more .
tr	4	The colors lifted their spirits as the skies were cleansed from the gray of smoke and haze of the previous days .
tr	4	" There has been something bothering me , though I have not been able to quite place it until now . "
tr	3	" I know it is troubling to see your homeland in such strife , but this is the way of the black creatures . "
tr	2	Each had been so caught up with their own survival they had begun to forget who they most could not afford to lose .
tr	4	" Yes , though it is many years since I have been there and the days of my youth are long since past . "
tr	4	They gathered their packs and removed any traces of their encampment scattering the ashes from the fire to the breaths of the four winds .
tr	3	It would be a taxing journey , easy at first as they had little worries of patrols scouting these regions .
tr	3	Some say it is but a wolf that roams but most fear it is a white spirit that haunts this cursed land .
tr	2	He will question one on all sorts of things , some you may feel have nothing to do with why you have come .
tr	4	These sights had been coming to him more each day , and each day they were clearer and more distinct .
tr	2	As he rounded the last boulder along a short section of the trail he looked down , a broad smile coming across his face .
tr	4	I am now certain we are being hunted ; they would not be here if they did not have to be .
tr	4	They had all secretly hoped they had guessed wrong and their enemy had not known of them , or of their quest .
tr	4	No new word was there to greet him , but he had time , more he judged than did his prey .
tr	4	He had traveled his lifetime in fulfillment of this quest and they would not be the cause of its demise .
tr	0	Clancy , good as his word had a roaring blaze within minutes and the others gathered about to ward off the night 's chill .
tr	3	He was wasting time he knew , but one who stands at sentry has all the time in the world to waste .
tr	4	He trudged off to the edge of the clearing , a more fitting place to keep an eye on things .
tr	0	He had kept the fire burning throughout his watch , the blaze beating back the chill of the night airs .
tr	3	The sun was now starting its march across the sky with full speed , its unrelenting light bathing the travelers in all its warmth .
tr	3	They would be traveling into his land and into his culture and they would not want to embarrass him with their ignorance .
tr	4	They made camp under an outcropping of shade trees , a one tuft on the very outskirts of the Barrier Forest .
tr	0	Clancy didn 't even break stride , he just kept walking , staring straight ahead as if nothing had been said .
tr	0	It was time for him to rest as he had covered many leagues ; it was always a tiring effort .
tr	4	It would not be long he knew , before he would be in contact with the forward edges of the black army .
tr	3	He did not want to rob them of their memories and no news of their land would certainly be better than the awful truth .
tr	2	As he turned he dipped and caught by a sudden rush of strong wind , the hawk flipped and fell sharply toward the ground .
tr	4	His eyes rolled back as his lids closed down upon them and he drifted away from the world of the living .
tr	0	Light jumped at him through the narrow slits as his head bobbed across the rocks , pain shooting through his every limb .
tr	3	The scouting parties would have to wait until later that night , then he would get his reports , and his command .
tr	0	His eyes would not focus ; he had no field of depth with which to judge the height of his cover .
tr	1	Instinctively he tried to raise his right arm and a numbing pain shot through his side , his eyes again rolling up .
tr	3	He would go down in a fight , with his last breath , even if it would be a pitiful attempt .
tr	3	They would have to withdraw to the safety of the mountains and work their way forward to the relative safety of the Barrier Forest .
tr	0	Finally , with the last vestiges of day a memory they scrambled high atop a narrow ledge just a few yards across .
tr	0	" It is not as pleasant a place as I had hoped for , but it will have to do . "
tr	3	They were tired and sore from fighting the mountain terrain , thus , they would not stand guard this night .
tr	4	He would let him rest for a short time , but they would have need to travel again this evening .
tr	2	If all went well , they would have a day 's journey to come to the border of his stronghold .
tr	4	The first they were able to just let slip by , the other however had caused them to take a time-consuming detour and backtrack .
tr	0	He spun his head quickly and caught a glimpse of something moving , something black that darted back into the darkness .
tr	0	He could not see him , nor could he afford to take his attention away from what was at hand .
tr	2	If you would like to share this book with another person , please purchase an additional copy for each person you share it with .
tr	1	Preview of Duty : A Retelling of Waterloo - In addition to writing fiction , Seeley is a Napoleonic historian .
tr	4	Although it was two days old , the following headline caught my eye : " Angry Student Kills -- Be Warned ! "
tr	1	He 's got Louis XVI , XIII , and Charles before him to act as guides , " my friend spoke .
tr	0	After perhaps a quarter of an hour of lounging about , Logan leaned up from his chair and slapped his knees .
tr	0	The words had scarcely escaped my mouth before Logan had leapt up and was donning his frock coat and rushing towards the door .
tr	3	My laugh rang out through the empty room as I raced to collect my own wardrobe and catch up with the man .
tr	2	Although the scenery was fantastic , the rolling and often uncomfortable seats of a locomotive are not the best of accommodations .
tr	0	Laughing together , we stepped aboard as it threw out a burst of steam and began winding its way towards Paris .
tr	0	Although I loathed their burdensome Latin , I was more than looking forward to traipsing among the catacombs and basilicas of that ancient city .
tr	2	I 'd been to London on several occasions , and the rushing citizens of our own capital were familiar to me .
tr	2	" Please kind sirs , do you -- " " No we don 't , " said Logan cutting him off .
tr	3	" That student murdered because the government tried yet again to throw him back into the poverty of his birth .
tr	2	" Well , I suppose killing someone for honor and all that is pretty fundamental to a man 's skills . "
tr	2	Brothers had crossed steel in the rosy dawn for control of land , women , wealth , and a multitude of other things .
tr	2	That didn 't stop him from ambling out of the room , and I heard him collapse on his bed .
tr	4	Climbing into sumptuous sheets , I again considered the haggard woman we saw along the street , the flies tormenting her .
tr	2	Fuchs , his nose bandaged , the burly second I had met , and a doctor all stood in the windy field .
tr	4	Whether by divine intervention or simple happenstance , a great gust of wind swept the ground as Fuchs pulled his trigger .
tr	1	His smoking weapon lay limp in his hand , and as I took it from him , the veins in his palm shuddered .
tr	0	Then , as his hands wiped away the excess from his lips , he drew up to his full height .
tr	2	Inside , the group would be making its way to our rooms , hoping to catch the two of us asleep .
tr	3	" If I hadn 't acted so damned foolish at that cafe , we wouldn 't be stuck in this . "
tr	0	Regardless of his aristocratic manner and shady friends , the death of this Fuchs character wasn 't likely to cause an international chase .
tr	4	As the minutes dragged by , I kept wondering what might have happened had our mysterious ' friend ' not intervened on our behalf .
tr	4	I roused my friend as our train moved into position , its engine bellowing steam and smoke like some foul creature .
tr	4	" We 're on our way out of the country , and whoever these fanatics are , they likely have lives in Paris .
tr	3	" If you know anything about the South , I 'm sure it has to do with two things : slavery and cotton .
tr	1	So , I was raised knowing my upper social standing and instilled with some sense of honor for what my father accomplished .
tr	1	Long hours I spent questioning her every fancy and taste , studying her passions , and finding the right moment to declare my affections .
tr	2	The God I loved had let his only joy slip from his grasp , and I could not answer for that crime .
tr	1	Meeting Logan 's eyes and nodding in response to his unspoken question , I took a quick breath and launched into our own narrative .
tr	3	It thumped as he dragged it to the floor , and my friend spread out the cards , cutting off all other protests .
tr	2	Once in awhile , the train would slow and finally stop as others joined our voyage or departed in turn .
tr	2	" If I recall correctly , " huffed Jacob , " You two lost all of that back to me in poker . "
tr	4	The Romans , the Catholics , and the Medicis have tripped over each other , building by building for time untold .
tr	3	Although vendettas were not uncommon , most duels went unaccompanied by rampant bloodshed ; two opponents fought , and that was that .
tr	0	Around us , the city continued to move and breath , almost like a creature , a vast thriving beast of wonder and sadness .
tr	0	We flagged down a carriage and made our way towards the richest of the viscount 's friends , a Mister Adriano Di Luca .
tr	2	Fluted columns surrounded the facade , and a slight footman dashed down the wide stairs leading towards the front gate .
tr	3	I was in great fear that the buttons on his tunic would simply burst , so great was the pressure exerted upon them .
tr	0	My friend attempted to bow formally and shake hands with Di Luca , but the larger man would have none of that .
tr	1	" Well sir , my companions and I are on our Grand Tour , and -- " " Oh heavens me ! "
tr	4	As the servants disappeared from the room , we also took our seats and began enjoying the wondrous delights before us .
tr	0	At the man 's words , the crowd began milling inside , and our group was carried along in its wake .
tr	0	That was rare , and Logan and I were pleased to see him happy ; a cloud of melancholy rarely left the man .
tr	0	There was already an empty drink in his one hand , and the other was reaching for another glass from a passing attendant .
tr	4	" I have no idea what elicited that scurrilous commentary on my character sir , but you best be careful .
tr	0	As the orchestra 's music swirled around us , Di Luca regaled the group with tales of the man 's gallantry and diplomatic affinity .
tr	4	Her other arm waited patiently by her side , and the folds of her blue gown rippled towards the floor like a rivulet .
tr	3	Forced to flee through the night , our bags stolen and rifled through -- it wasn 't a story I was proud to tell .
tr	3	Dumas himself might have written a novel about us : the three companions strutting off the train into a new city .
tr	3	Just know that they 're very dangerous , incredibly rich , and will kill you without a moment 's hesitation . "
tr	1	" My lady , I highly doubt such murderous rascals would be allow -- " " Not here , " she hissed .
tr	0	I was looking forward to a nice , relaxing bath and a luxurious sleep in one of Di Luca 's expansive beds .
tr	1	" Perhaps if you reason with them like that , it 'll change their minds , " I said laughing .
tr	2	As Logan drew out his sword , which we 'd all worn as part of the costumes , I continued .
tr	4	There was no time to check on him , though , because around us , other forms were already whirling past in the darkness .
tr	3	" Nathaniel , stand by that column ; if they come in through that door , you know what to do .
tr	3	Jacob pointed towards me , then indicated the entrance ; what better time for an ambush than when attempting to parlay .
tr	0	If you simply hand -- " Just then , a cry of agony resounded through the church , and I whirled about .
tr	1	Unfortunately for Logan , the man 's instinct had been to drive a short dagger into my companion 's arm .
tr	2	In spite of his scream , the wound wasn 't as bad as we originally thought , or so he mimed in the gloom .
tr	1	Inside , Logan and I gave a nod towards our friend , and we slipped back into the night , our weapons drawn .
tr	3	True to Jacob 's count , three men waited in the stirrups of chargers , and the valet stood among them , strategizing .
tr	3	Two horsemen spurred their mounts towards me , but one was instantly thrown from the saddle , a pistol crack sounding nearby .
tr	3	It felt wrong to abandon our friend , but there was nothing to be done about him ; he was past help .
tr	2	Chapter X Logan rocked with the movement of the train , an ignoble spot of drool forming on his cheek .
tr	3	The man wouldn 't take my apology if I didn 't retract my words , so what was I to do ?
tr	2	Men without honor don 't do well in the South , and men of honor don 't back down from duels . "
tr	3	But it 's not like it was murder ; the fight was fair , and it was at his behest .
tr	3	Our train had left Rome without incident , and the rest of that afternoon was spent admiring the passing countryside .
tr	4	If Mercedes ' father was anything like his other relatives , our visit would be enjoyable as well as informative .
tr	2	We watched him come up to you , and as he reached out to tap you , I turned to Jacob .
tr	0	I had no idea how well a minister of war would be paid , but I was surprised that the home was not larger .
tr	4	As he tried to form words for an appropriate acknowledgment , the woman offered Jacob and me the same familiar embrace .
tr	1	How can a revolution , by definition a huge shift in a country 's government , occur while the king still lives ?
tr	3	Next , the two middle points of the diamond are the monarchy 's support : the Church and the Nobility .
tr	1	If a man can succeed by his own drive and talent , his bloodline doesn 't matter to King Martin .
tr	1	With taxes , mobility restrictions , and business limitations , the Faith had gotten their hands deeply into installing their social order .
tr	1	He was a relatively high member while a minister , but his political downfall shot him to power within the Faith .
tr	4	We stared in shock at the mess and the view out into the royal gardens that the collapsed wall had exposed .
tr	4	He 's not expected to handle a great load of state business , and he 's not greedy for power .
tr	1	He 'd been looking forward to hunting bucks in Switzerland for years , and he 'd finally chosen this year for that occasion .
tr	1	His brass buttons bouncing , he raced up towards Joseph and bent towards his ear , whispering something I didn 't catch .
tr	2	That some young blood could kill Otto was a complete effrontery to them , and they were all calling for your deaths .
tr	0	" I did start noticing that an extra plate of food was always reserved and carried away from the table at meal times .
tr	4	The streets were rising slightly , and by the look of the houses , we were entering the oldest part of the city .
tr	1	If she 's right , this is absolute evidence of the Faith 's guilt , and the king will have no qualms in acting .
tr	0	At the checkpoint , a royal guard approached the carriage 's window , and Joseph leaned out , speaking first .
tr	4	At the end of the main corridor , having passed at least a score of rooms , we reached another foyer .
tr	3	I 'm sure you 're willing to vouch for them , but given the situation , we must take precautions .
tr	1	He was hunched over in his chair , his arms resting on his knees , as if he was sulking .
tr	0	I know caution is key after the bombing , but I was practically kidnapped from my own tea table by the guards .
tr	2	The monarch 's body collapsed like a sack of wheat , the rest of us too shocked to utter a sound .
tr	0	His face was gleeful and had the boasting air of one who had just won a lengthy debate or sporting match .
tr	2	For his troubles , a Courtier kicked him in the chest , driving him back onto the bloody stones once more .
tr	0	His hand gripped a sword at his side , and the uniform he wore was easily recognizable as a royal military outfit .
tr	4	I dashed to the hunting room , grabbed the first revolver I found , loaded it , and raced here by hired carriage . "
tr	4	It wouldn 't do to escape once and be captured , which I feared should we leave in our present state .
tr	2	But even knowing the layout , Eva took one or two wrong turns , and we were forced to backtrack .
tr	3	With her in the lead again , we strode along the path , attempting to look at once official and nondescript .
tr	0	Nestled in a small grove of oak trees and set back from the palace , it was faded and in a bit of disrepair .
tr	1	Throw in some new information and surprise him with ferocity , and he 'll never know what hit him . "
tr	2	Laying track through the mountains is a long process , so for now the two are only reachable by horse or by walking .
tr	0	As I said , it 's not a long journey , only half a day , and the route is well established .
tr	3	Instantly , the crack of muskets filled the air , and faint thuds filled the carriage 's interior as the balls found their mark .
tr	4	" We need to ditch the carriage ; they 'll recognize it , " Logan said , breaking me out of my thoughts .
tr	0	After a time , the houses began to thin , and the occasional plot of open land began to appear .
tr	4	Even as we reached the platform , reining in our horses amid a shower of grit , the engine began to move .
tr	4	He tried several times to answer , but every attempt only brought more spurts of uncontrollable laughter ; tears streamed down his cheeks .
tr	3	Our discussion on this same topic had led to the duel with Otto Fuchs and our flight across the continent .
tr	3	My stomach roiled at the thought that I was a part of it all -- the pain , the suffering .
tr	1	He was puttering towards us , a small pouch clutched in his hand and a nondescript uniform hanging off his drooping shoulders .
tr	3	I don 't think I 'm allowed to take that coin ; it 'd take too much trouble to exchange it .
tr	3	The streets arched away from the platform like sunrays , and it was obvious that the train station was the town 's center .
tr	1	With nothing but a knowing look between us , Logan led the way down and off the platform and into the town .
tr	4	After leaving the rough cobblestones of the village 's street , a simple dirt path wound along the perimeter of the town .
tr	4	" Phillip 's sure to know the land , and we 'll figure out what to do after he 's safe .
tr	0	He can do whatever he wants , and apparently he 's a good enough charlatan to prevent others from catching on .
tr	0	The manor was set back from the woods by a short distance and would give a brilliant view of any attackers .
tr	2	We 're lying scoundrels who simply happen to know of Fuchs ' plot and have somehow stumbled upon one of the Faith 's manors .
tr	1	" Oskar was supposed to bring the news , but he fell from his horse just as he was leaving .
tr	3	That scene was forgotten as I was thrown to the ground , the other Courtier tackling me in a powerful hug .
tr	3	Next , I moved to the fallen soup kettle and dipped the cloth into the hot water , soaking it .
tr	2	The walls rose up and eventually angled into a spire , the roof of which was invisible to our lowly lamp .
tr	4	The room was small and aside from the door in which we 'd just entered , three other doors waited in the room .
tr	2	Although his lips emitted no noise , his body fell backwards , collapsing into the door with a hollow thud .
tr	1	I could see large beads of sweet trickling down his throat , mixing with his blood from the Courtier 's knife .
tr	3	I couldn 't tell if he was trying not to cry or pressing them together to avoid screaming in rage .
tr	2	" I hadn 't thought of -- " A crack from a pistol cut him off , and we wheeled to face the door .
tr	3	Then , sprinting through the gauntlet , I leveled my shoulder and hit the glass without waiting for the others .
tr	1	A cold night 's wind rustled my hair and I sailed through the window , glass glittering about me like rain .
tr	3	I took it to be a wolf at first , but the gleaming yellow eyes told me of my mistake .
tr	2	We moved parallel to the road , far enough away to avoid detection but not too far as to miss sight of any pursuer .
tr	0	While he didn 't speak , I knew that Phillip was longing to know of his brother and how he met his end .
tr	0	Eva had mentioned that Fuchs had used the man as a model for impersonation , but that was too vague .
tr	4	Branches creaked against each other , and as we approached , a feeling of darkness swallowed us as we entered this forest .
tr	3	I omitted the details of Fuchs ' impersonation for the moment ; we 'd come to that after Phillip 's explanation .
tr	1	They sounded the alarm , and you know the rest , " finished Logan , leaning back into his chair .
tr	0	At other times , he 'd sit me down in a chair and draw my features over and over again .
tr	0	" For the mess you normally are , this isn 't half bad , " he called with a laugh .
tr	4	After a while the streets were filled with residents , and the few shops opened along the village 's main street .
tr	2	Your one task was holding him until we could proceed , and you let him slip through your hands like water .
tr	3	The train stopped then , and Kurt slipped onboard and out of earshot , leaving the unfortunate Courtier in his wake .
tr	2	No one followed , but I continued to dodge this way and that , curving around strange streets for an hour .
tr	0	After securing a small lunch from a nearby vendor , I walked along , avoiding all contact with those that remained .
tr	3	If these were shut for the night , I 'd be out of luck and forced to wait until morning .
tr	2	I was forced to dodge patrolling groups of soldiers , and the whole time , I was terrified of discovery .
tr	4	As much trouble as I had finding an address that I knew , it would 've been impossible tracking down the monastery .
tr	3	You show up at his school and tell them about the plot , and we 'll have fifty recruits before the hour 's past .
tr	1	Spitting to rid myself of the acrid taste and wiping my eyes to regain my vision , I raced through the constricting passage .
tr	1	I recognized various buildings , and I could see the monastery 's walls jutting out from the skyline to my right .
tr	0	Any second my pursuers might race forward , trapping me and presumably Eva and Jacob , within the walls of the place .
tr	4	After a moment , I realized it wasn 't a greenery , but it could easily be mistaken for such .
tr	3	Potted plants and flowers of various hues dotted the room , but what I 'd taken for a conservatory was actually the infirmary .
tr	1	Besides , if we show Phillip as proof of our story , Fuchs and the Faith will be on us faster than rain .
tr	4	My helper seemed suspicious at first , and when I 'd left him , he went and notified the constables .
tr	3	I was incredibly fond of that feature , and it had only started to grow in fully in recent months .
tr	3	" Not to discredit that , because you have a good point , but who says I 'm not a suspect ?
tr	3	" It 's too late to turn back now , " I said as our horses turned a corner in the tree-lined path .
tr	4	Each wore fencing gauntlets and carried honed sabers , but their entire front was covered by a thick leather pad .
tr	3	I 'm not sure what I expected , but when Joseph had mentioned the school 's waiting army , this wasn 't it .
tr	2	The school must 've been large , but most of the floor space was housed in the single room gaping in front of us .
tr	4	I wondered where the man had disappeared to , but he called out from the front of the group before I could ponder .
tr	4	He 's shown that much already , and despite their name , there are no Christian principles within the Faith . "
tr	4	Foliage crunched under foot as we wandered the paths around the institute , and each day carried on much like the previous one .
tr	3	It felt almost sinful to relax in an armchair by the fire and peruse through the latest work by Dumas .
tr	4	As the geese swam about , I asked her how she 'd come to be with Kurt and the Faith .
tr	4	I sent my father a letter after I 'd gone ; he 'd never have agreed to it in the first place . "
tr	4	We traveled to enough places , and Kurt always went out of his way to ensure I was enjoying myself .
tr	3	When they went to murder you that night , Kurt didn 't argue with them , but I wouldn 't have it .
tr	4	I smiled nervously and made some comment about my lack of practice , but the master shushed me and stepped back to observe .
tr	1	" In no time , friend , you 'll be back in shape and we 'll turn you into a fine fencer . "
tr	2	On the day of the first snow , Jacob wandered in from the cold to find the two of us fencing .
tr	4	Although he still moved with a hint of difficulty , his recovery was wonderful , and the man was becoming more and more active .
tr	3	But he 'd disappear for most of the day without comment , and when present , a dark cloud hung about the man .
tr	4	' This week , His Majesty 's guards were fortunate to discover new evidence in the plot against the royal family .
tr	2	Christian hospitality is never frowned upon , but to aid , comfort , and help murderers of the royal blood cannot be tolerated .
tr	4	Over the course of a few days , all those without noble blood of some kind were dismissed from service .
tr	4	Then , in the dead of night , as a November chill circled the school like a feral wolf , another messenger arrived .
tr	4	However , Martin and the baron grew friendly over the years and when he died , he bequeathed the castle to us .
tr	3	There 's two turrets at the north and south ends , and each has an ornate suite of rooms at the top .
tr	3	It 's all very beautiful , but I wouldn 't have the first clue about how to assault it . "
tr	4	Giving him money for his travels and the purchase of masonry equipment , we sent him off and settled in to wait .
tr	0	Parts of the great hall had a light layer of snow about them , and the room was incredibly drafty .
tr	4	It all seemed to help ; I 'm sure I was nervous enough , but they didn 't seem to notice .
tr	3	It 's a small door , but it 's thicker than the main gate and would be louder than a drum to batter down .
tr	3	I snuck down to the water , and I could see the pipe sticking out through the castle 's foundations .
tr	1	November in Germany is obviously not warm , so I 'd only be able to try once each morning and night .
tr	2	But as the blood rolled gently , almost peacefully , down his neck and my arm , I felt myself nearly collapse with him .
tr	3	The waters gently lapped against the manor , but the pale gloom cast the castle in a vicious , threatening light .
tr	3	Kicking with all my might , I shot through this space , slicing my arm on the ragged edge of the rusted metal .
tr	4	The shadows also covered the space , providing a ready hiding place from the great hall which spread out before me .
tr	3	If he can 't get the father to follow orders and stick to the plan , why not the daughter ?
tr	4	I 'd kill the fellow before he 'd raise the alarm if necessary , but my conscience hoped for otherwise .
tr	3	As with Kurt 's attempt , the groan it let out was ethereal , a ghastly moan in the otherwise quiet castle .
tr	4	Without much delay , we threw Kurt and the other prisoner into a large cupboard in a corner of the kitchen .
tr	4	Sweat trickled down his brow , and the ragged breath escaping his lips was punctuated with muttered , incomprehensible words .
tr	2	He was too experienced for this though , for he dropped his weapon 's tip , curving it to parry my own move .
tr	2	Once the man had been thrown to the ground , his leg a collapsing wound , Jacob looked at me again .
tr	0	Panting , we continued ever onwards , the stairs spiraling around and around like a massive auger , throwing us skywards like abandoned earth .
tr	3	Two tall windows raced towards the ceiling along the room 's perimeter , and the airy snow continued to drift by outside .
tr	2	" I don 't know how you boys got here , but you 'll find it rather more difficult to leave . "
tr	1	But if you persist in pointing that infernal device at your royal king , things will become decidedly painful . "
tr	2	You 'll lay down your weapons and surrender to your treacherous doom or you 'll watch her brains coat the carpet .
tr	2	I killed the monks for the same reason I killed the king -- opposition to the will of God is too dangerous .
tr	4	He looked possessed , and I had little doubt he would fulfill his gruesome promise to the letter if the chance arose .
tr	4	The falling snow , the pale moonlight , and the looming trees watched me as my feet churned the snow .
tr	4	Fuchs had tripped over our friend 's body , and the fallen man 's sword now rested in the scoundrel 's paw .
tr	1	I nudged my own blade forward , a single drop of blood spilling from his neck and racing down my upturned weapon .
tr	4	The man who welcomed me in , who rescued us from the devils -- that man was not an enemy .
tr	3	But by the time I recovered , the imposter was sprinting through the night , all thoughts of resistance abandoned .
tr	2	Their feet rushed by in the gloom while I lay , too shocked , too drained , too cold to move .
tr	3	More than that , I 'd lost innocence , and I wasn 't sure I could recover from that fall .
tr	1	As you know , Fuchs sifted through the palace 's staff , removing all the lower classes -- a distasteful business .
tr	2	Of course I 'm not privy to everything , but from His Majesty 's own lips , Austria is angry enough to shed blood .
tr	0	* * * * * A steady wind raced our carriage as it wound its way through the capital towards Phillip 's palace .
tr	1	Though her face and twisted spine had vanished in an instant , her memory , her meaning lived in my mind .
tr	2	To Daniel Fry : Thank you for your ideas , your encouragement , and your many hours of conversation with tea .
tr	3	If you liked The Faith , I 'd humbly ask that you please write a review and tell others what you thought .
tr	0	A tall man wearing the same uniform as us sauntered our way , his fiery hair bouncing with his movement .
tr	2	The laughter of courtesans ' jokes and the clink of champagne glasses would bounce around the room with wild abandon .
tr	1	I could see the gnarled scaffold ahead , the single noose moving slightly in the wind , waiting to grasp its lonely victim .
tr	4	We walked along , and although single hecklers called out to the condemned , the once raging mob continued its silence .
tr	4	We led the king up the steps , and the guards split off to form a circle around the base .
tr	0	They were long and contained an artful memory of King Martin , as well as a passionate haranguing of the Faith .
tr	3	They started to boo him down , but Phillip raised his hands as well , and the mob silenced instantly .
tr	3	The result was utterly comical , and the poor man had to wait another moment for the noise to die down .
tr	0	A boy , with no place on the battlefield -- a boy hardly younger than myself -- lay in my arms .
tr	4	Bread and grain for troops were seized ; wool , cotton , and all other textiles were commandeered for uniforms .
tr	4	Rushing home , I broke the news to Claudette ; she smiled , her nationalism evident across the wide grin .
tr	3	She had little doubt that France and the Emperor would finally conquer in the days to come , but I only thought of Henri .
tr	1	Grinning , ever silent , she dipped her finger in the suds , drawing stalks of wheat and circling birds .
tr	3	Turning my chair around to face our cottage 's door , my breath caught in my startled throat as well .
tr	1	It was Henri 's body , but my son , unbeknownst to me then , was not present in this shade .
tr	1	Days of unkempt stubble crept across his face like patchwork , and a massive scar cut through his pale skin along his cheek .
tr	0	Chores done , we again sat around the table , pretending to eat breakfast , but in actuality , waiting for Henri to awaken .
tr	1	On this particular occasion , the Irishman and his friend were returning from the Cape Colony en route to Dublin .
tr	0	Finally Ainsworth noticed Ward wasn 't keeping pace , and he turned around to see what the lagging was about .
tr	0	His glance tracked each mustache 's cut as he sought a glimpse of the face , haunting in its familiarity .
tr	3	That was where the two had met , and Ward had been confident that his opponent would return to his cards .
tr	3	" Well there 's nothing for that ; we just need to watch him and avoid interaction until his seconds arrive .
tr	0	Ward changed his attire , washed his face , drank a small glass of brandy , and snatched up a walking cane .
tr	0	King began barking orders as Flaherty turned and walked over to where Lieutenant Head was talking to Captains Llama and Ghost .
tr	4	He was attired as they were , in full dress uniform , as was the custom for dinner at Castle Destro .
tr	4	" McLeod had been planning to retire next year and he wanted to pass the company off to you . "
tr	4	However , man for man , they fell well short of measuring up to the skill and tenacity of the Grenadiers .
tr	0	But I 'd like to think that perhaps we can help each other deal with this problem through unofficial channels . "
tr	3	" To be honest , I was a bit surprised that Aries allowed you to take both Humpty and the Hobbit . "
tr	4	As soon as we have all the weapons , we 'll be ready to hump down to the landing field . "
tr	4	He 'd also told them that he expected them to train alongside their subordinate men until they were every bit as knowledgeable .
tr	2	I 'm sorry I said anything , " he apologized , laughing as he stepped out of the shower to dry off .
tr	3	He 'd have the right answer , despite the fact that Flaherty wasn 't quite sure what the question was yet .
tr	2	Flaherty chose bacon , eggs and potatoes , while Goggles grabbed a cup of yogurt and two pieces of toast .
tr	0	" I understand that congratulations are in order , " Starbuck said , leaning in to shake Flaherty 's hand .
tr	3	We 'll get back to it tomorrow morning , but for the moment we have other matters to attend to .
tr	4	As Ghost watched , one , then two and finally three more icons flashed red before the survivors broke contact and fled .
tr	3	" They aren 't moving around much , but they 're out there , just like Laird Destro thought . "
tr	2	Shock pulled out a topographical map of the area and began running Llama through the disposition of troops he 'd been able to document .
tr	3	If you wan na catch some Z 's , you better get back there and hit it before Outback starts snoring . "
tr	3	At the time , we were under the impression that the betrayal was aimed at obtaining the sample without paying for it .
tr	3	They have instructions to conduct a thorough reconnaissance of the waterfront , but to avoid contact if at all possible . "
tr	0	Reaching the docks , he wound his way through the support columns until he found what he was looking for .
tr	4	" Okay , we 'll give it fifteen minutes to make sure that we weren 't detected on the way in .
tr	3	" We should have no trouble making it down to the landing field with maybe thirty minutes to spare . "
tr	3	But for the first time in a long time , Flaherty had someone that would actually miss him if he didn 't return .
tr	1	His captors quickly relieved him of the M4 , his sidearm and his combat knife before rolling him over onto his back .
tr	2	His position in the corner room on the top floor of a run-down hotel was perfect - except that there was nothing to observe .
tr	4	Sergeant Blister 's team was situated three blocks away , on the opposite side of the target , performing the same tedious task .
tr	4	The Grenadier moved around to Snow Job 's side and carefully sliced through the heavy plastic of the flex cuffs .
tr	2	" But now they know we 're on to this location , so you 're planning to breach it , aren 't you ? "
tr	0	" I 've heard quite a bit about you , Captain , " Aries said as he stepped forward and shook Flaherty 's hand .
tr	4	The voice belonged to a young woman who was dressed much like the Iron Wolves , but wore no helmet .
tr	4	Lieutenant Graves was playing the slightly obnoxious drunk , while his ' friend ' , Sergeant Blister tried to get him safely home .
tr	1	One second there 's nothing , the next there 's a bunch of yahoos running out of the building , looking upset . "
tr	4	" The wounded will receive whatever immediate treatment is needed and then be flown to the location of your choosing . "
tr	0	" Besides Llama 's squad , we have a company of Highlanders , a company of armor and a full brigade of infantry .
tr	2	Moira and the Joes stayed behind with a platoon of Iron Wolves to conduct a thorough search of the entire facility . "
tr	0	A block and a half away , Misfit sat behind an American-made M24 Sniper Weapon System , watching Huerta through the scope .
tr	4	Then , holding it by a leg , he used it to hit Huerta in the side of the head .
tr	3	It took nearly four hours to search the entire facility , but Moira felt confident that nothing had been missed .
tr	0	Masque would not have thought that Strauss could turn any paler than he already was , but he managed to do exactly that .
tr	1	Masque is still working the prisoners , but we 're going to kick this shit off as soon as they get here .
tr	3	Suffice it to say that the apple has never fallen far from the tree in that part of the clan . "
tr	4	As always , he was among the first jumpers out the door and was , therefore , one of the first on the ground .
tr	4	" If that 's the case , then we 'll set down at the palace and use it as our base of operations .
tr	0	Vulcan made it safely across and the team began advancing down the waterfront toward what appeared to be a grain mill .
tr	4	Just before reaching the conference room where the CP was being established , they passed the Prime Minister 's office .
tr	4	Things were taking too long to develop and it made her want to take to the field herself and move things along .
tr	0	Llama pulled himself to his feet and started toward Shock , managing all of two steps before pitching forward onto his face .
tr	3	Llama could tell by the size of the gaping wounds and the twitching of his body , that Biscuit was dead .
tr	0	Chapter 57 As Anastasia regained consciousness , she winced at the surge of sharp pain at the back of her head .
tr	2	" I don 't know how he got to you , but it 's not too late to change your mind about this . "
tr	4	" If she elects to continue running her mouth , feel free to shut her up , just don 't damage her permanently .
tr	0	Anastasia felt her ass burn and her face color as she ground her teeth hard enough to cause another wave of pain .
tr	4	Fifteen feet away , Sergeant Shock was clearly losing his patience with Corporal Gundam , the medic who was examining him .
tr	4	Tucker , break out the scanner and let 's see if we can get an idea what we 're dealing with here . "
tr	4	The waiting was intolerable , but they had yet to discover the underground passages being used to move the Baroness .
tr	3	Having Mayhem calling the shots would allow Destro to pursue the Baroness ' abductors without fear of neglecting his duty to his men .
tr	3	" Truth be told , I 'm a bit anxious to get to the Central CP and check-in with the Baroness . "
tr	0	Waiting was not something she was particularly good at , which was odd given that she was such a gifted sniper .
tr	4	" My dear , you have the patience of a two-year old , " the old General said with a grin .
tr	1	King threw his second tomahawk and struck the fuel tank centered on Inferno 's backpack , causing it to ignite .
tr	0	Once a day , a bearded man with dark hair arrived and met with the people for half an hour or so .
tr	4	Bing loosed a pair of missiles and was gratified to see both targeted vehicles disappear , each in their own glorious fireball .
tr	4	" Establish a perimeter and hold the site until I can drop some infantry in there to augment your people . "
tr	3	Unfortunately , it was moving ever further from the capital city and toward an area that had seen some of the heaviest fighting .
tr	4	" Once they figure out how few of us there are , it won 't take them long to find their balls . "
tr	0	He had no heartache with a woman wanting to do a job , so long as she was actually capable of doing it .
tr	4	" Laird Destro is in the field and is likely to require assistance at or near those coordinates , " Mayhem responded .
tr	4	Haven 't you realized that the super soldier program was not the failure your father claimed it to be ? "
tr	0	" Aries , you will assume command of my Elite Guard until such time as Captain Nirvana is back on his feet .
tr	1	It is a mix of esoteric ideas with real world problems and social dynamics in a fictional world , tailored to entertain and inspire .
tr	4	They made this realm their home and served the balance until their father went to sleep in order to continue the Cosmos .
tr	1	It was a phenomenon he realised was also in all things , from as tiny as blood vessels to a whole mass of trees .
tr	1	Closing his eyes he began the steps to slip into meditation , the sounds of his surroundings penetrated his consciousness .
tr	1	He focused inward listening to the flow and exchange within himself , feeling it all with his mind and body .
tr	4	His awareness expanded and it was like he felt the planet , he could feel the cool breeze as it caressed his body .
tr	0	A phrase leapt out at him ' All is one ' , this was so ; he felt it , so it was real .
tr	1	" I know nothing and yet I know it all , truly my journey has just begun , " he replied .
tr	1	Spreading out his arms , he filled his heart with the feelings from his meditation and it was like a song that warmed him .
tr	1	Oasis isn 't here right now because he is searching for Riva , his kin , she left on a mission of rescue .
tr	0	My gaze turned towards the space known as Milky Way and that was when I first noticed highly chaotic anomalies .
tr	0	Usually such did not exist from our point of view ... A heavily potentiated chaos and I heard the call .
tr	4	Only those with a great need could be heard by us so clearly and so I moved myself from my environment .
tr	0	I felt my mortality in flesh as it compounded around myself , my soul fragmented and I heard Terra once again , saying .
tr	2	The long war had changed much , no longer could I enjoy the benefits of my position as the commanding officer of this army .
tr	4	The Sphinx have given us a thousand of their best warriors and they requested to be directly under your command .
tr	2	It brought laughter from me and I soon realised from the look on his face that my reaction was misunderstood .
tr	4	I lifted my eyes to the skies and saw a clear view of the stars , already I missed my kin .
tr	3	These Humans didn 't know that Terra herself , the spirit of Gaia called me , to save it from a catastrophe .
tr	1	Oasis , the first , said the next stage was absolute wisdom and understanding , its teaching was hard even for him .
tr	2	Glorious warrior of old , our elders told us of you , we would be honoured to follow you . "
tr	4	Disconnected limbs littered the ground , except were long projectiles stood with impaled soldiers and the soil was heavy with blood .
tr	3	But then I saw the oddest thing , he attacked his own men ; his lust was driving him out of control .
tr	4	Suddenly the situation was much clearer , they used a typical tactic of deception to fool honest men into rebels .
tr	0	Gaia herself knows and will always know that there is no paradox , but you may not , " I continued .
tr	3	The Confederation intends to turn this gift against you , to destroy your reality , split your planet and kill you all .
tr	4	I could feel the wind pick up its pace around me and I caught the strand of connection , between two ' wheres ' .
tr	3	Perhaps it was a result of the denial of the truth of the word , or the unity intrinsic of duality .
tr	3	In the next instant projectiles rained upon us from above , as the Citadel itself put us in its targets .
tr	3	Seth ran to me as Ra began preparing to hold the shield , and I felt comfort knowing that they would help protect us .
tr	4	The battle was in the enemies favour , for now ... " Sphinx hear me , " I called in their minds .
tr	2	It dodged and came at me with a strike at my shoulder ; I moved my stance and lunged forward .
tr	3	My suit felt tampered ... I look down at my hands to see the claws uncontrollably shifting form and I retracted them .
tr	4	A loud cheer filled the area and my senses overwhelmed me with praise ... Hail Traveller ... I heard whispered .
tr	1	Time had slowed down from my perspective and I wove the air into the desired attraction , still spinning as I did so .
tr	3	I stood firm and faced them , retracting the spear 's blade , turning it into a harmless looking staff .
tr	0	Before you stand Sphinx and Traveller , attack if you dare , " I called to all and silence sang their hesitation .
tr	0	Walking through I spun the staff fast and hard , creating a painful ' v ' and I passed through the enemy mass .
tr	0	They came at me and I ran at them , and all was silent save the sound of us running .
tr	1	With my spear fully formed , I brought it down in a diagonal slash ... I can 't win , not like this .
tr	4	I mustered force and pushed her away , in time to shift my position , dodging an otherwise lethal blow .
tr	3	No it can 't be true ... Did she plan all this from the start , predicting my actions but how did she know ?
tr	3	It is rumoured that she holds the book of destiny , perhaps there is some truth to this ... " Why Tiamat !
tr	0	" Alas , it will come to pass that Gaia is split asunder , causing great pain to the spirit Terra and her children .
tr	2	Our bodies grew in size and I returned to my mortal form , the blood of giants strong in my mortal shell .
tr	4	The battle came to a rest as all eyes turned towards us , unreal creatures of immense proportions floating above them .
tr	3	Right now , the Confederation has turned a great deal of attention on Humanity and your task is to help them .
tr	3	-- Adam My breathing was steady even though I was running in pursuit of my target down an empty street .
tr	3	Without us our brethren would perish , this was why I couldn 't understand why my target would be against us .
tr	1	Glancing at my mobile , I saw it displaying ' Unknown ' , and I answered the call with my hands free .
tr	4	I walked to the side of the truck and opened it , revealing why we were called soldiers of peace .
tr	0	Finally I saw it and the warehouse was imposing , it was a large metallic structure in a clearing surrounded by trees .
tr	0	I glanced down at my rifle and saw that the red LED was ' off ' , meaning that the pulse was armed .
tr	3	I swung my right pistol , adding its rounds to the left , trying to track and predict his now zigzag approach .
tr	1	I held my guns limply at my side , they were useless against him , I couldn 't kill him .
tr	4	" Who I am is another tall order , let me simply say ... " he replied , adding a short nod in acknowledgement .
tr	0	What is real and what is unreal in a world of endless possibilities ... " Adam answered to my thoughts yet again .
tr	3	" At first he may have started with good intentions , but your kin are hated by The Orion Confederation .
tr	0	he asked and I looked again certain that there wasn 't , but it had changed and now there was a forest !
tr	3	The crystal being walked to the NWO representative and calmly thrust its fist into the mans chest and he dropped instantly .
tr	0	There was a bright light and suddenly I was back at the warehouse and I was sitting with my back to a crate .
tr	0	On my right was a blade in a scabbard ; I got up , picked it up and unsheathed it , revealing the blade .
tr	1	A new project , a building for implementing and maintaining Brethren cells , but as far as I knew it was still under construction .
tr	4	There was a work station ahead of me but there were military men everywhere and then I saw General Tani .
tr	0	It may have heard my thoughts the way it laughed and it approached me calmly , as I had seen it do to others .
tr	3	With that thought I brought my blade down on the console destroying the system , and just then General Tani opened the door .
tr	3	This was but a half way point and I wondered how long I would have to wait until the next transport .
tr	0	" Midway station , all change please , " came a call from the driver , as the bus rolled to a halt .
tr	3	I thought back to the last few months ... The nature island of Dominica was a relatively untouched beauty among the buzz of civilisation .
tr	3	My parents ' death was a result of vanity and now that vile ego of the culprits seeks to finish the job .
tr	4	I sat and gazed yonder but only for a moment ... " Excuse me , could you please pass me the paper ? "
tr	4	" My apologies , I am sure he will be found innocent , " she offered , with a smile .
tr	2	He stood on the right of the house , but not close enough for me to make out his features .
tr	4	I was still sceptical , however , if he wanted me dead I would be , so I gave him some time .
tr	3	You must have quite an inquiring mind ... " I started to say but my statement was interrupted by a ring tone .
tr	3	" I hope you haven 't forgotten your training , " I heard a voice and instantly I recognised it for my mystery tutor .
tr	3	They came again , this time four attacked but three came first and I blocked the first attack from my right , unbalancing him .
tr	4	Anyway your chains have been weakened , the rest is up to you , " He concluded after taking his time to regain composure .
tr	1	I leapt clear just as the van previously holding me flipped and collided with the vehicle in front , finishing with a blast .
tr	3	It helps at least that I know they don 't want me dead but I can 't fight them all , not this time .
tr	0	The train was the loudest and approaching fast but I could hear my pursuers screaming as they ran at me .
tr	1	In the early hours of a new morning , I lay down in an open field overlooking a large lake .
tr	3	It concentrated into a ball of electric fire , brighter than the Sun in its light , with hints of patterns and colours .
tr	3	Without thinking I rose to my feet , making my way to the lake just as a figure walked out .
tr	0	The figure was gold and black , and shone like a precious stone , as it approached I realised it was a golden woman .
tr	1	" Well if you must know , I am Tola and we are in South America , I think , " I replied .
tr	3	It was the day I met him , " she spat out the last sentence with an odd mixture of disgust and admiration .
tr	0	" Whoa , weird , " I said as I stared at my hands , it had never done that before .
tr	2	Shade nodded and walked towards the main doors , while I took a right through a short tunnel to the shops .
tr	0	" Damn ... " Was all I could say as I saw that most of the people at the station were coming at me .
tr	0	I could feel it rushing as my awareness began to expand , I saw through the fabric and I saw the universal truth .
tr	0	As I pulled out my daggers ready to charge Nuru once again , but I felt a hand on my shoulder .
tr	0	I watched as Adam looked towards them and a portal appeared and they vanished through it , again Nuru screamed .
tr	0	Gather your weapons and follow the path I will make for you , " Adam said , opening a Gateway .
tr	1	His arms began to tire as they should after fighting for five days , even his prodigious strength had its limits .
tr	4	He welcomed this as a chance to catch his breath , even as he struggled to keep his blades raised in warning .
tr	2	I am Kane your Lord and Master , and it was I who brought this destruction on your people , " the newcomer said .
tr	1	Kane could be seen screaming orders to his warriors ; suddenly there was a flash of light and all was darkness .
tr	2	You can visit my website to contact me , read more of my work or follow the link to my FaceBook page .
tr	4	Lo demons and spirits conspire , And nature unleashed its rage , More energy did I acquire , And thus escape my cage .
tr	2	No part of this book may be reproduced , scanned , or distributed in any print or electronic form without permission .
tr	1	" I will bond myself to a warrior and sing of his deeds ... " " And to which warrior ? "
tr	1	Over his armor he wore a shirt that bore the royal Oster coat-of-arms : a gold rooster against a red field .
tr	2	He drew out his long steel sword , a weapon worth countless amounts of silver that only rich men could afford .
tr	1	But no sooner had the words left his lips than Gunnar swung down and slashed the wrist of the king 's man .
tr	1	" I intend to find this witch ... kill her , take the idol , and give it to King Sven .
tr	1	He tried to put a foot inside the wicked haunt but his muscles froze up , his conscious mind held him back .
tr	3	Then he fled out of the witch 's den with Brand close behind , and ran straight south as a storm began .
tr	3	It would make a great gift to Sven , but Gunnar had no doubt that the added power would come at a steep price .
tr	3	If he cannot find it in his heart to forgive , it 's off to the torturer for you . "
tr	0	He had his thumbnails ripped out ... then they sent him off to the gallows , and had him hanged . "
tr	1	In the darkness , having no wood for a fire , Gunnar and Brand huddled together against the wailing winds .
tr	1	In his own time , Gunnar did gather some kindling from the forest and start a fire with Hilda 's tinderbox .
tr	1	I wear the clothing of men , I make my own decisions , and I fight my own battles . "
tr	2	I will go with you to White Wolf Keep , but not because of you ... not because I trust you .
tr	2	You 'd not make a good mistress and , by the looks of you , not a spinner of wool neither .
tr	4	Inside the curtain walls of White Wolf Keep was a collection of ramshackle wooden houses seriously in need of repair .
tr	4	Only a dozen males were in the room ; half of those were servants , and the other seemed very old or very young .
tr	4	Yet stretching above the wall were tall pines -- dark green , almost black against the steely gray peaks of the mountains .
tr	3	But these rustic northerners were not used to good entertainment , only war , dull clothing , and constant cold .
tr	0	" Perhaps if you had a heart , you would care , you cold , cruel dog , " Brand said .
tr	2	One of the figures was an adult woman and the other was a young boy of no more than four or five .
tr	2	From the looks of it , the Darkling Wood was only about a mile in length and two miles wide .
tr	2	A figure in a black cloak walked out of the shadows toward him , moving across the snow yet leaving no footprints .
tr	1	" Perhaps it is time to fight the evil in the Darkling Wood instead of feeding it , " Brand said .
tr	2	" I do not want to be bitter ; nor do I wish to be a cold , cruel dog , " Hilda answered .
tr	1	Gunnar had given him a little training , but not enough for him to bear a sword with anything approaching competence .
tr	0	Standing a few yards away was a little girl , her head cocked at an impossible angle and dry blood covering her mouth .
tr	0	Baring dark yellow fangs , the wolf reached out with his right paw and scratched hard into the ice with one of his claws .
tr	1	" I will not go in without my ... dear wife , " Brand said , glancing furtively at Hilda .
tr	1	I soon grew tired of these people 's soft ways , their luxury and unwillingness to take up swords , " Hilda said .
tr	0	" A night 's rest in bed can do much more than any valkyrie or goddess can , " Hilda said .
tr	4	He supposed that Hilda had been through more than Gunnar , and in spite of the pressures men forced upon her as a woman .
tr	0	Brand strayed from Hilda -- who was looking at the elven knives longingly -- and gave it a careful look .
tr	3	Hilda was of a noble house ; Brand knew this , but the listing brought it to the fore of his mind .
tr	4	Brand shrugged off a spear of envy at these people 's enchanted lives , though now they were long dead .
tr	0	Brand took a step forward with his own sword , but Hilda looked back at him and glanced at him sternly .
tr	0	" You have a weapon of light metal and can wave it like a feather -- a weapon I could never afford .
tr	2	I beg of you , do not kill him ; it would be like throwing away that pile of gold . "
tr	4	He grinned , revealing the few yellow teeth he had , and said , " I 'll have your slop in a second .
tr	1	" If you kill my friend , Hilda , " Brand said , " then I will not sing for you . "
tr	4	You only broke the king 's seal and fled the earl 's service ; she is a murderess , a thief , and more .
tr	1	Wise men have said , ' The goal of a noble house is to bring all others under its submission . '
tr	0	He kept walking closer to Brand , and Brand kept backing away , but he 'd hit the wall soon .
tr	0	There was a hint of accusation and bitterness toward Brand in Hilda 's voice , and it tore at his heart .
tr	2	I once thought you were a brave man ... but now you hid from ghosts and abandoned your post . "
tr	0	" My lady , " Brand said , " if you mean to seduce me , I do not wish to betray Harald .
tr	2	He died a few months ago of a wound and now I have no one to fulfill my passions . "
tr	0	A cold wind blew out of the sea from the northeast , making the air burn against Brand 's partially exposed neck .
tr	0	The vulgar image that hung above the door -- a naked woman and man in a lovers ' embrace -- aroused him .
tr	4	" It gets tough sometimes , " she said in a strange accent Brand didn 't recognize , her shapely body dripping with sweat .
tr	0	" You 'd be a fool to throw away all you 've gained in my court , " Harald said .
tr	4	We have only a garrison of a hundred troops , your lordship , and these intruders are like none I 've ever seen . "
tr	3	The sounds of battle continued an hour afterward , and then the winds grew so strong that the only audible sound outside was howling .
tr	2	" You once were a good woman , but now -- " " She once was a common whore ! "
tr	0	" I may prefer peace to war , " Harald said , " but I will not bring such dishonor as to not retaliate .
tr	0	It was a large building of dark stone , supported by thick gray pillars and capped with a domed roof .
tr	4	" In my homeland , we decorate the pillars and make them pleasing to the eye with flutes and carvings .
tr	1	The River Guard hopped off their horses , gold armor glinting in the sun , and drew their sharp steel swords .
tr	4	There were about twenty of them : big , lumbering brutes with muscular chests and powerful arms gained by years of hard work .
tr	0	" She is a rich woman , " Harald said from behind , " and I am a rich man .
tr	4	I require my junior priests to keep it burning at all times -- it 's a symbol of our people 's hope . "
tr	0	" Perhaps the warmth and brightness of such a flame is all you really have in this frozen wasteland . "
tr	1	Brand had a hard time believing such difficult work and strenuous living conditions could bring joy , and he pitied anyone who could .
tr	1	Passing the priests ' quarters , the rooms were of shabby stone and boasted only straw beds and chamber pots .
tr	1	Due to the chill of the air , and the fatigue of the living conditions , his voice had grown hoarse .
tr	4	" We have not yet seen him , " Harald said , " nor have we been in the Golden House .
tr	3	As he turned to sit back down in front of the fire , he caught Harald 's eyes staring at him .
tr	2	" I do love her , " he said , " but I do think that I am performing your duty for you .
tr	4	" My wife knows this and does not care ; nor does she get jealous of those grubby women who serve me .
tr	0	" Harald , " Brand said , " I do not know what it is in Varda that you mean . "
tr	3	it said , and did not shut up when Brand struck it and or whispered blasphemies to the Great Mother .
tr	0	The next day they placed Harald 's body in a coffin and began an all-day procession to the Church of Vana .
tr	0	They did not know Harald as Brand knew him -- a strange man , and a luxuriant man , but perhaps one of honor .
tr	2	" Sigmund , " Brand said , choosing not to address him by the proper title , " Do not call me a boy .
tr	0	The pain was sharper this time , and more acute ; and there was a loud cracking sound as the whip dug into flesh .
tr	0	Sigmund glared at her , then looked back to Brand and said , " What happened to the High King ? "
tr	0	He is a good man ; and an honest man , and he said he did as the king asked . "
tr	1	In winter , they can often be seen rolling in the snow or bounding through the mountains in a never-ending hunt .

tr	0	Only partway through my pastry and cardamom tea , and already a panicked man stands chattering to me about a monster !
tr	4	He had heard the story thrice now , listening for the inconsistencies fear introduces to memories -- even honest men 's memories .
tr	4	In his youth he 'd been the best brawler on Dead Donkey Lane , and the other boys had looked up to him .
tr	2	But I 'll try my best to do so , and to stop whomever 's responsible , God damn them . "
tr	4	" And the bastards will charge you too much once they see your silks -- they respect neither piety nor the Order .
tr	4	He charged as he saw the girl raise the blue rope -- tied with a small , sleek knot -- to her lips .
tr	1	It is impermissible , according to the Traditions of the Order , to twist information from one who must be slain . "
tr	1	It only took one bad whisking to break a mind , and the caster never knew when it was coming .
tr	2	But if you 'll be reasonable you may walk off this ship , and we 'll put the boy off as well .
tr	4	Then he set his tea bowl down , belched loudly , and relished the horrified grimace of his virtuous new apprentice .
tr	2	I can take no more of the man 's unctuous voice and , praise God , I don 't have to .
tr	4	Yousef seems relieved that I 'm not angry with him , though I don 't quite know why I would be .
tr	4	I say more farewells to the villagers , firmly discourage their company , and set off alone on the road .
tr	0	The rocky path is not too steep , and green sprays of grass and thyme dot it -- a pleasant enough walk , really .
tr	2	No ' peace be upon you , ' no ' how is your health , ' no ' pleased to meet you ' .
tr	4	" O , my beautiful wife ... " The leg flexes , but still no sound comes from behind the screen .
tr	2	God protect me , I know nothing of ... of ghouls , or -- " A horrible thought comes to me .
tr	1	Then I am holding a man 's loose tendons in my right hand and thick golden threads in my left .
tr	4	They are -- they look like -- the legs of a kid or a ewe still in the womb . "
tr	4	" I swore to my mother , O Shaykh , that I would wear her scarf when I came of age .
tr	0	He stood up shakily , but as his voice took on the High Shaykh 's formality , it gained strength .
tr	2	God is with you , for ' God smiles on all men , but smiles on the righteous man twice . '
tr	1	In God 's name , I -- " His words stopped as his eyes bulged out and he fell back in his seat .
tr	1	I loved him and I feel his loss -- for ' Death is only a loss for the wicked and the living . '
tr	2	The details are sort of lost on me , especially when he starts jotting down some sort of equation on a napkin .
tr	4	This is the seed of something truly amazing , and for once I 'm happy to have shown up for a Society meeting .
tr	1	So I charge up my infernal internal dynamo , watching the orange glow begin to shimmer off of my arms .
tr	1	" I also think , " he began , switching to Arabic , " this is the stupidest fucking movie script ever written .
tr	0	They parted ways after breakfast , and Muhammad begged off when his friend invited him to a party that night in the Valley .
tr	3	That old gal taught me a lot of lessons , but sticking to my own business was just about the best of 'em .
tr	0	I suppose it would have drove a lot of men mad , riding with a man as quiet as that .
tr	0	Now I 'd heard that when he was a natural living man , they called him Shambles on account of his funny walk .
tr	0	My mouth dried up , my heart hammered hard , and I screamed and ran back the way I 'd come .
tr	3	It 's one thing to get shot , but it 's another thing entire to have your blood spilled for black magic .
tr	2	I swallowed and foolishly tried to play on the guilty conscience of a man who didn 't know what conscience was .
tr	1	He sang a quick string of words in his talk -- sounded similar to his sunset prayers , best as I could tell .
tr	2	More proof , as if he needed it , that traveling the Old Cairo Road on foot was as good as asking to die .
tr	3	Ali 's attention snapped back to the present as the wind picked up and the air grew thick with sand .
tr	3	More than one vet had lost theirs , had sworn that their OS had told them to slaughter their family .
tr	2	If he was gone too long , Ali could count on the Fatman to provide a few days of coverage for Lubna .
tr	0	The top half of the thick red minaret had long ago been blown away by some army that hadn 't feared God .
tr	1	I was saying -- I told my wife about this prompt and she said I should go around the city digging up fountains .
tr	1	The old man spread his arms as if his shabby office was a palace , his two goons gorgeous wives .
tr	1	The road gods ' idols in particular are poorly maintained and thus their wishes are far from clear here . "
tr	3	" That wasn 't my fault , sweet Hai Hai , but we 've had this argument too many times before .
tr	2	Give me one good reason I shouldn 't chop your balls off before my friend chokes you to death . "
tr	4	Most days he 's here until I close , but ... " the man gestured helplessly at the empty room and overturned tables .
tr	3	I swear by the twin gods of truth that it won 't end well for you if you defy her . "
tr	4	Like all priests , he 'd had his desire for women magically shorn from him in exchange for his strange powers .
tr	3	" The god of lost things says that what you seek is indeed in that building , my friend . "
tr	4	Clearly , the mercenaries weren 't used to intruders , as they tried to handle the threat themselves instead of sounding the alarm .
tr	1	It focused its pulverizing punches on her , and she was fast enough to stay one step ahead of its strikes .
tr	4	Hai Hai leapt about at the stairway 's exposed side , her sabers darting in and out , and wherever she leapt men bled .
tr	1	The priest squinted hard at the door and sniffed the air , his nose twitching as if in imitation of Hai Hai 's .
tr	4	I sent him to steal my earring from you to bring you here , where I first appeared to him .
tr	4	The weakest nudge in a corner of your mind when you touched that earring was the utmost my efforts could produce .
tr	2	You think you long for me , but you don 't know what it is to miss someone the way I miss you .
tr	4	The indicator lights were all a sickeningly green tone and she imagined if she vomited now the color would complement those lights nicely .
tr	3	She turned to him with her hand out , " Easy , just going to check the outside display . "
tr	1	Anything out of the routine will make him nervous , especially after the reality of what is going on sinks in .
tr	3	The lavatory was only a small enclosure within the vault , but it might as well be worlds away in this situation .
tr	3	Not even a year ago there would have been a contractor on duty during the night shift and not just during the day .
tr	0	She knew this was ridiculous , but in for a penny , in for a pound , her mother had always said .
tr	2	She unlocked her side of the vault door and waited for Timmons to unlock his side so she could exit .
tr	4	Seeing him unnerved her more and she was about to start yelling at Timmons when she was thrown off her feet .
tr	0	The lights came back on in a weak flickering sort of way that indicated generator backup power was now in use .
tr	0	Jacobs screamed at her and began pacing in the crowded vault , hands on his head tugging at his hair absently .
tr	1	An idea occurred to Susan , " Why don 't you turn on the radio and see if you can get any information . "
tr	3	" Stay calm , we don 't know anything for sure yet , " she said soothingly with her hands out towards him .
tr	3	Without thinking about what she was going , Susan drew her own pistol the next time the lights flickered off .
tr	3	The man closest to the entrance bolted out of his chair towards the door and Joshua hesitated , nearly letting him go .
tr	3	Joshua tensed up and started towards his brother , but Nathan stepped in front putting his hand on his son 's chest .
tr	0	They would have skinned you alive and raped mom for days , and you want to give them a proper burial ? "
tr	2	David turned away from the conversation , clearly already bored , and moved to a pistol thrown into the corner during the commotion .
tr	4	Bring your mother in here and try not to let her see any more of the death than she has to .
tr	0	David walked back across the small room carrying several pairs of boots under one arm and a bag of loot in the other .
tr	3	Nathan told him he needed to put them out of their misery , but didn 't want to use a gun .
tr	0	" Fine , " said David as he turned and walked away into the approaching twilight the shotgun slung low over his back .
tr	0	Nathan had known a few men in combat who took to killing , but none as readily and easily as David .
tr	3	" Get dressed and start filling up anything you can find with water and put it in the basement . "
tr	0	Nathan ran to the hallway gun case which was leaning precariously and grabbed everything he could carry downstairs into the basement .
tr	1	He saw two large bags of dog food and after slinging the duffle across his body , picked the bags up on his shoulders .
tr	4	Moving towards the basement he yelled upstairs , " Boys , get Daisy , she 's under the bed ! "
tr	1	Nathan felt worried looks on him and wished he could manage some encouragement , but he couldn 't think of anything to say .
tr	0	It was late fall , but the air was colder than it should be and the clouds were dark and menacing .
tr	3	Any item they took that wasn 't in the basement with them was wiped down carefully to remove radioactive particles .
tr	0	Another time they approached a small group of houses in the twilight and saw a large sign saying " Stay Away ! "
tr	4	The soldiers had likely lost heart and abandoned their posts , letting the streaming masses of desperate refugees cross the border .
tr	3	Nathan decided to have them turn south in order to avoid the larger cities of Charleston and Huntington , West Virginia .
tr	4	On the roads , they spent most nights in abandoned cars along the road because these afforded shelter and security .
tr	0	Nathan and his family were walking in the West Virginian Appalachians in late fall , but this was also a blessing .
tr	0	They followed the Appalachian Trail for a few days , staying in the hiker cabins located at regular intervals along the well-worn path .
tr	3	The men would talk , ask for something in return for crossing , and the family would make it through unscathed .
tr	4	Nathan waited in the ditch by the side of the road near their gear , giving everyone else time to move into position .
tr	2	I don 't want to have to blow your head off before seeing what kind of goodies you brought us . "
tr	4	Two other men had not even seen him yet ; they were trying to shoot back at David and Bethany from under the cars .
tr	0	Nathan ran back to the middle of the road , grabbed his shotgun and pistol and sprinted to where David and Bethany lay .
tr	4	Reggie became the public voice of the Jackson Purchase ; even though he wasn 't really officially in charge of anything .
tr	4	It had needed some oil on the chain and air in the tires , but otherwise was in decent condition .
tr	4	" Based on available time , I 'll ask you some of the more popular questions that people have requested we bring up .
tr	3	Reggie thought it best not to talk about the fistfight between two of the county executives that occurred at the last meeting .
tr	2	" How would you respond to some who claim the Governor is dead and that you are now in charge ? "
tr	2	Governor Henry is a dear friend of mine and I know he would want each of us to do our best .
tr	1	I am only an advisor to the cooperative council , which is the lawful operating local civilian government at this time . "
tr	1	Tim spoke quickly , " Reggie , I 'm sorry , it just kind of came out , " he said with obvious embarrassment .
tr	4	Reggie sighed wanting to be angry , but knew that feeling was counterproductive , " I know and its okay .
tr	4	If they escaped , they could run back to their barricade at the other end of the bridge and prevent them from crossing .
tr	0	Joshua might give them an advantage on the hill , but he would be waiting for Nathan to make a move .
tr	0	That thought left his head as he heard other shouts from beyond the barricade and then another shot from Joshua .
tr	2	One looked to argue for heading back over the bridge and the other for the closer protection of the road block .
tr	3	As they were arguing , Joshua took out the man on the right drawing a scream of frustration from the other .
tr	2	He handed the rifle to Joshua along with about sixty rounds of ammo recovered from the former owner 's backpack .
tr	4	Might even be the smartest thing , but there could be more of them waiting hidden in the trees on the other side .
tr	2	If no one crosses by sundown , come to us and we 'll make our way over in the dark . "
tr	0	She placed a calming hand on Nathan 's shoulder , " I know , and that 's not what I mean .
tr	4	General Anderson sipped his hot tea and scowled at the heavily scribbled and highlighted map on his dining room table .
tr	1	Reggie Philips officially recalled him to active duty and placed him in charge of the military district made up of the Jackson Purchase area .
tr	1	" General Anderson , I know you didn 't ask for this any more than I did , but we need you .
tr	1	Philips was right , however , and Anderson 's ingrained sense of service and responsibility would not let him turn his back .
tr	0	He threw himself into his work trying not to think about his children or how much he missed his wife .
tr	1	Chapter 7 -- The Captives David 's look of surprise was soon replaced by a grim set of his jaw .
tr	0	David had not returned from his reconnaissance , but Nathan could see the glow of a fire ahead and hear soft voices occasionally .
tr	2	Also , in case you haven 't noticed , you look like a damn butcher covered with all that blood from today .
tr	4	Once everyone understood , the three began to slowly and carefully crawl forward in the snow toward the sounds of strangers .
tr	4	The natural bowl in the earth , and the thick trees on the edges , masked the firelight and sounds .
tr	4	The wild woman spun her head around without taking the screwdriver from Bethany 's neck and met Nathan 's tense gaze .
tr	4	He continued after a pause , " People here , given time , will transition to some alternate form of practical government .
tr	0	Frank Simm , in his immaculate state police uniform , leaned forward and placed his hands on the table in front of him .
tr	2	Anderson took off his glasses and sighed , " With that said , we 're going to need more troops .
tr	3	" I would like to have Butch Matthews here talk about an idea he has that I think might be our best bet . "
tr	1	Butch nodded his head , " No , for all intents and purposes the Guard is now our permanent standing army . "
tr	1	Butch smiled at him in gratitude while Anderson tilted his head and looked back at Reggie with a knowing smile .
tr	3	They also are not set up to produce ammunition at all , but the guys down there know what they 're doing .
tr	2	" Which brings us to one of our final problems , " said Butch , " but not one to be overlooked ... training .
tr	4	" Yeah , " said Anderson gruffly , " things we don 't need to train them on like , for instance , sleep .
tr	2	He looked like he was going to say more , but sat down instead and no one spoke for a long time .
tr	4	They also agreed to the " raid " on Fort Campbell , as soon as the resources could be gathered and the weather improved .
tr	3	Reggie initially took his attitude to be indifference or negativity , but he saw with dismay that the man was utterly exhausted .
tr	2	Letting them in now would only be taking on more mouths to feed with nothing productive for them to do . "
tr	0	Even while thrashing in Nathan 's arms to get at her son again she screamed at him , " What 's wrong with you ?
tr	0	David was breathing in great gasps of air , Nathan wasn 't sure that he wouldn 't take off again .
tr	4	Chapter 10 -- Decisions Harold Buchanan rubbed his head and looked down again at the sheet of figures on his desk .
tr	2	Also , Harold could work them longer hours , but that came with a cost he knew only so well .
tr	1	This decision is mine , and I accept full responsibility ; but I 'll need your help in carrying it out . "
tr	3	We 're going to have to trust in the fact that these men can live the best way they can .
tr	4	Those that we think will only use this as an opportunity to prey on the weak and defenseless cannot be released . "
tr	3	The fuel wasn 't a major objective of their plan , but when Butch saw the tankers , he just couldn 't resist .
tr	1	They locked the ammo supply point back up , having not even made a significant dent in the massive stock of ammunition .
tr	4	They were in a long slow convoy several hundred meters long , heading back out the same way they had approached .
tr	3	As the small building came into view , Butch saw a tree about two feet thick lying across the road .
tr	0	He turned to the rear of the column and started screaming and waiving his hands , " Back up , back up now ! "
tr	2	Butch only thought for a few seconds before walking to the front of the convoy and laying down his rifle on the road .
tr	0	Butch turned and saw a tall athletically built man of about twenty-five purposefully making his way towards him at a light jog .
tr	0	Butch nodded and watched the man walk away and raise his rifle parallel to the ground over his head and give a piercing whistle .
tr	4	Moreover , the inmates on death row had long ago accepted the fact that execution was their due and their resistance had been minimal .
tr	3	They tried having the prisoners hooded , but it didn 't help much and Harold just couldn 't bring himself to gag the men .
tr	2	His words were cut off as Harold shot the man in the side of the head from a foot away .
tr	1	" I do , " Harold sighed , " but I don 't think we can go on with the firing squads .
tr	4	Besides , even if his friend took care of the execution or subsequent accident , it would still be on his head ultimately .
tr	4	They 'd stayed a couple of days to rest and get everyone 's strength up , then began moving again .
tr	4	" One of the scumbags -- maybe the only one with a soul -- threw them the keys as he ran away .
tr	3	" I 'll try to explain to the boys ... tell them to treat them with kid gloves for a while . "
tr	4	He took her advice , and over the next days and weeks they really became a family , or at least a clan .
tr	4	Reggie grew up around horses , but had almost forgotten how temperamental they could be and Clipper presented quite a frisky personality .
tr	4	" Uh , Reggie , we all feel we have a piece of business that must be handled before anything else . "
tr	4	Hell , we know we 've got a good thing going , but we need a stronger government than the Cooperative Council . "
tr	1	Without the JP , we 'd be cold , hungry , and worried about raving crazies killing us and our families .
tr	4	We made the JP up , but it 's a good thing , and we need to make sure it sticks around .
tr	1	" First , any official leadership position for any new government should be a democratically elected official , which I am not .
tr	1	" Gentlemen , I know it is not my place , but I would like to speak , if you don 't mind . "
tr	3	" With that settled , " said Anderson with finality , " I think we can move on to other business . "
tr	4	They had tentatively reached a deal in principle where the WTR gave them compensation in corn and other hard-to-find items .
tr	3	After months of waiting , the JP still had not actually received anything from the WTR in return for the electricity .
tr	0	Reggie turned to walk away and Anderson asked after him , " What do you want me to do for now about Sampson ? "
tr	1	Ethan 's spidery web of informants and influence had already spread thoroughly and firmly throughout the Republic and into neighboring lands .
tr	4	Chapter 16 -- Hancock There were probably two dozen people gathered outside on wooden picnic tables around a small radio .
tr	3	People talked quietly , not wanting to miss the break in the static that signaled the beginning of the show .
tr	4	They were released individually at five minute intervals to walk the one main road south or north out of the small town .
tr	1	Any man who returned , or was seen in the town of Hancock after sunset , would be shot on sight .
tr	2	They have additionally asked that people refrain from buying and selling fuel illegally which only hurts us all in the long run .
tr	4	They might also be letting people in regardless , especially if they possessed special skills , but he couldn 't count on that .
tr	1	Tim Reynolds was continuing on , but Jim Meeks ' gigantic frame suddenly thundered up to him in a huff .
tr	2	He followed Jim 's big figure out into the open sunlight and saw two guards with rifles ready looking down .
tr	3	They were talking about him he felt , but could not tell exactly what they were saying due to the fact that they whispered .
tr	0	The huge man Nathan had seen outside earlier on the wall walked close to Nathan and looked down at him calmly .
tr	3	" That means no spitting , profanity , biting , throwing bodily wastes at us , or in any way trying to injure us .
tr	0	" But I was shot , " said Nathan sucking in his stomach and feeling an immediate wave of pain wash over him .
tr	3	We do , " replied Nathan as he slowly drank the cool water , letting it clear the foul taste out of his mouth .
tr	1	" And home is in the JP , " Harold said this with a knowing tone , as if it explained everything .
tr	4	As he passed out the door , he said over his shoulder to the men , " Let him go . "
tr	2	A dog 's world is the pack and one of the cruelest things you can do to a dog is to isolate them .
tr	0	Harold put his hands behind his head and closed his eyes with a smile , " A nice hot tub . "
tr	1	Counting Nathan and his two boys , they numbered thirty-six men and women working in rotation to guard the camp every night .
tr	4	He saw Cujo , the dog rescued with the women and girls , lying by the fire guarding the little ones .
tr	1	Her words stung and Nathan fought against anger , " Damnit , we don 't even know if the freaking JP exists !
tr	2	He was probably confused whether he was supposed to go back to being a normal kid or try to embrace manhood .
tr	0	One of the prison guard 's daughters was playing a violin and the pure , wondrous notes actually brought tears to Nathan 's eyes .
tr	3	" There is still beauty in this world , Nathan , " she whispered , " don 't forget that . "
tr	2	Row upon row of drab tents and shacks spread out before them like something from the crowded slums of Brazil or Haiti .
tr	2	They soon came to what was obviously the infirmary and also a food distribution center , with another set of guards .
tr	4	Nathan couldn 't see who addressed him , but he lowered his arms and spoke to the uniformed group eyeing him over their weapons .
tr	0	The man who had been speaking stood from behind the barricade , and Nathan noticed he was a Staff Sergeant .
tr	3	The man started to retort with a smart reply and then looked down at the military identification card and paused .
tr	4	As they walked west into the JP , Nathan looked back at what had very quickly become his extended family .
tr	0	Several raised their hands in return and then Nathan Taylor turned his back on them and walked across the bridge with his family .
tr	3	Butch Matthews was with him , along with Captain Terry Johns , the National Guard commander in charge of the troops at the dam .
tr	3	" Sir , I held my tongue out there for the sake of politeness , but now it 's my turn to talk . "
tr	2	Anderson shook his head , " Graves County consolidation was before my time , I went to Wingo High . "
tr	4	" I 'm sure you 're familiar with the Land Between the Lakes Park which basically makes up the JP 's entire eastern border .
tr	3	The dam sits right at the top of the park and makes electricity from the water flowing northward from those two manmade lakes .
tr	2	The southern portion is also a wide open highway for General Sampson , should he choose to come north . "
tr	1	If you don 't give me what I want then you can let us go and I 'll be on my way .
tr	0	Nathan sat back and crossed his arms and the two men stared at him for a moment and then at each other .
tr	4	Although Nathan didn 't use the offered fuel to drive home , he hadn 't hesitated to use the telephone .
tr	1	" Actually , you 'll inherit former Lieutenant , now Captain , Jason Green and his men from Fort Campbell .
tr	1	So assuming Captain Green is successful in his mission , we only have to worry about the northern area . "
tr	3	" I understand it 's a large area , but if you have to prioritize anything , protect the dam at all costs .
tr	2	He 's going to have the job of security of the dam and his company will be made up of our folks from Hancock .
tr	4	I 've already set him to work establishing a sustainable logistics plan that will cover the entire park area and the new residents . "
tr	4	" I 've seen it done , in some cases done well , but it was outlawed in most states years ago . "
tr	0	" I think we probably will , " answered Nathan a little amazed at the resources Butch was willing to push his way .
tr	0	Nathan savored every familiar sight , sound , and smell and was gently coasting down a long curved hill of the two lane road .
tr	3	Times were hard , but it was obvious that they had rolled out a day long party in their honor .
tr	1	Everyone was talking at once , and touching him , and hugging him , and Nathan felt a loss of control bordering on panic .
tr	1	With no warning , Nathan found himself sobbing in her arms , and could not make himself stop for some time .
tr	3	Sampson fully believed that might made right , and the JP had the might when it came to electricity which infuriated Sampson .
tr	3	They would then go to the planned location and each party 's escort would gather and look at each other until the planned time .
tr	2	For this meeting Sampson had asked to meet along the old Georgia-Pacific rail line in Fulton which ran from south to north .
tr	0	Sampson strode forward of the line followed by an aide and in a fairly arrogant manner waved General Clarence Anderson to him .
tr	4	If you look to my rear you will see we have delivered all the compensation that we owe you . "
tr	0	I will take it back to the council and Mr. Philips , and propose it as a mutually beneficial arrangement . "
tr	4	" This , General Anderson , is a proposal for a military and economic alliance between the West Tennessee Republic and the Jackson Purchase .
tr	2	" Oh I think you do , even if you don 't want to admit it , " Sampson smiled .
tr	2	" You are good , very good ... but the time for games is soon coming to an end . "
tr	3	Regardless , you better not cut off our electricity , don 't even think about it , it 's not an option for you .
tr	0	Anderson also evidently knew many of the same people and shook hands and talked as he made his way towards Nathan 's table .
tr	0	The side committing espionage normally has most of the advantages and the way we almost always catch them is when they make a mistake .
tr	3	I know it 's not their area , but the State Police would probably be the best option for now .
tr	2	I 'll put you in touch with the State Police Commander , Frank Simm , and we 'll get the ball rolling .
tr	0	" Well , that 's a little bit of a larger and slightly more complicated issue , " said Nathan .
tr	2	" You have our permission , and that 's a good recommendation we 'll pass to the other units , " said Anderson .
tr	1	So our people aren 't regularly crossing to the south and they aren 't regularly crossing north , " said Nathan .
tr	1	Nathan laughed in spite of himself , " Well , I did do this for a living after all ! "
tr	4	The church doors remained unlocked most times , but Brazen was the only person there at such an early hour .
tr	0	Timothy Walker came from a broken home and was raised along with his little sister by a strict and religious grandmother .
tr	4	She saw the dark path he was on growing up without a father figure , instinctively seeking that figure in all the wrong places .
tr	4	He was tough and serious at the same time he was kind , sincere , and generous in all he did .
tr	4	Various gang members followed him around and watched his back and did not resent his total lack of acknowledgement of their existence .
tr	3	Going back to finish at MIT was now out of the question , so without thought , he drifted back home .
tr	2	Brazen was too honest to try to fool himself into thinking he was a good man doing good work for society .
tr	0	He looked at Sergeant Major Luke Carter and then at both David and Joshua who were standing with him in Nathan 's office .
tr	4	This is between the Sergeant Major and I. I 'm frankly not even sure why he brought you here . "
tr	4	Brazen spent considerable time trying to figure out if he was the good man doing nothing , or part of the evil .
tr	2	Little John 's Bar was what could be called neutral territory not really claimed by any rival gangs , or controlled by the city .
tr	0	He always kept at least one large goon with a bat around to emphasize the point , today he had four .
tr	0	Brazen had talked to John ahead of time and assured him things would be fine , but John was taking no chances .
tr	4	" I brought this meeting up at the executive council and both the President and County Executive insisted they join me . "
tr	1	" That is not important , and not your concern , " said Brazen never taking his eyes off Reggie .
tr	3	Also , I want to say that I am not happy with the way things are , and I see the bigger picture . "
tr	3	At the same time , WTR forces to the south are gathering strength and could look to make a move soon . "
tr	4	These regiments are made up of volunteers , but the equipment and supplies are paid for by the state . "
tr	1	Both Mitchell and Williams looked like they wanted to discuss this with Reggie in private , obviously to express their further misgivings .
tr	3	I shouldn 't have to warn you gentlemen that you do not want to go back on a gentleman 's agreement with me . "
tr	4	Now I 'm in a position where if I make a mistake , lots of people suffer , maybe even die .
tr	4	I admit it 's a gamble , but we 're getting to a place in the game where we have to gamble .
tr	1	John was not a man to get excited easily , but Nathan wasn 't willing to consume precious gasoline on an unstated problem .
tr	3	" That 's because we 've got the air conditioning going full blast , but that is only a band-aid to a gushing wound .
tr	3	At least this didn 't happen in the winter , thought Nathan , the worst of the cold is past .
tr	4	" We 're going to need at least a few hours notice to shut this down , " he finally said .
tr	4	" When people hear that broadcast , they are going to all rush to do everything they can electrical at the same time .
tr	0	Fifty thousand loads of laundry going at once , kitchen appliances at full blast , charging countless electrical devices and batteries .
tr	0	" Sampson wants the dam , and he 's looking for a pretext to take it , " said Harold .
tr	4	Anderson decided he would call Sampson personally and try to explain the situation and even offer to give the compensation back .
tr	0	Anderson also told Nathan to go ahead and call President Philips and tell Philips that Anderson approved of Nathan 's plan .
tr	4	I urge everyone to stay calm , work through issues and problems together as a community , and remember who you are .
tr	3	He had planned to talk first of course about the electrical outage , but portray it as a good thing .
tr	0	Reggie was also careful about his public appearances , and the JP put the police and military forces on alert .
tr	1	" At least you didn 't have to deal with introducing me , " said Brazen with a smile of his own .
tr	4	" I sure hope I 'm right about you , because , if I 'm not , we 're all doomed .
tr	2	It would be a good opportunity for you to set yourself up pretty nice , if you wanted to . "
tr	3	" What about the people there , what would their feelings be towards an annexation into the WTR should it come to that ? "
tr	3	" We could feint toward what they expect , and attack where they do not , catching them by surprise . "
tr	2	Sampson stood and began to walk out the door and then turned and looked at Ethan , " We 'll move forward immediately .
tr	1	Anderson couldn 't risk sending patrols across the border and spark an actual conflict if Sampson 's intention was only intimidation .
tr	1	Those little biplanes had initially been nothing more than platforms to view enemy dispositions , similar to hot air balloons during the Civil War .
tr	4	He looked back into the sky and saw how the grey clouds swirled together , but there was almost no wind at ground level .
tr	0	What had drawn them to this location were numerous rumors and hints gathered from locals talking about activity along the major waterway .
tr	0	His recon squad was made up of two four man teams each with a team leader , sniper , medic , and automatic rifleman .
tr	3	He also didn 't want to start messing with them too soon and cause them to speed up their own timeline .
tr	0	A second later the Barrett to Joshua 's right boomed and he saw a splash of water near the gangplank .
tr	2	" That 's enough for now , save the ammo , " said Joshua , stopping them for the moment .
tr	4	Chapter 13 -- Tornados Lieutenant Beau Myers was more than a little overwhelmed by the mission General Anderson had so suddenly thrust upon him .
tr	3	He also told Beau to get some altitude so he could get a better look at the forces to the south .
tr	3	Beau was just starting to get a good look to the south when he heard Teddy say , " Uh oh . "
tr	4	There to the south , directly adjacent to the Purchase Parkway behind some barns and farm buildings , Beau saw three tanks .
tr	0	Beau had a moment of horror when he thought Teddy would accidently run him down and cut him up with the spinning propeller .
tr	2	Neither would now be safe from Teddy 's drunken ideas on how to overcome boredom , but that would have to wait .
tr	3	David admitted to himself that he was still a little raw over Joshua getting to lead the recon instead of him .
tr	0	David nodded and ran off to gather his men taking them east along the road atop the dam towards the locks .
tr	3	Says he wants you to know that time is limited , and whatever you need to do , do it quick . . "
tr	3	" But why exactly did you feel it was so important to rush back here to tell me this information ?
tr	2	Do you know there 's probably not many soldiers who would have gotten the tactical significance of what you saw , but you did .
tr	4	The two men nodded solemnly and the commander began to speak , possibly to apologize , but Anderson knew there wasn 't time .
tr	3	We need to destroy those tanks , otherwise ... well I don 't want to think about what happens if we don 't . "
tr	4	He traveled for several days , made his way back west again towards Camp Beaver on the JP 's eastern border .
tr	0	You had to find an open area with clear sky lines and stand still for sometimes as long as five minutes to acquire signal .
tr	0	Dusk was fast approaching and he watched the wife through the window as she lit an oil lamp and appeared to be preparing food .
tr	0	At the same time , the old man came out onto the back patio and sat down alone facing away from Walter 's cover .
tr	3	Walk up , shoot the President in the chest until the gun was empty , drop the gun , and walk away .
tr	3	He also saw that the rest of the transports were attempting to land on the east side of Barkley Lake on David 's flank .
tr	3	He noticed that the new troop transports were dispersing all of their troops on the north end of the park .
tr	4	The sight was so amazing that he nearly got caught looking before diving under a large pallet of sheet metal .
tr	0	Jim was in the act of hanging up when he caught this last part and screamed , " What ? "
tr	4	" They left with all the troops they could gather this morning to come north after the enemy passed under the bridge .
tr	0	Chapter 18 -- An Act of Bravery Beau Myers thought that the raid was almost too easy , especially at first .
tr	0	The initial plan had been to park the vehicles a distance away and approach the tanks on foot in a combat wedge formation .
tr	3	Beau thought it might be worth pushing their luck a little further and stepped out of the vehicle towards the man .
tr	1	" I don 't think General Sampson took you into consideration when he made his plans , " said Beau .
tr	4	" We 're not here to guard the tanks , we 're supposed to attack with them north when we get the word .
tr	4	These are our tanks and we 're not ... " The man 's voice trailed off as he noticed the Kentucky license plates .
tr	0	After putting out his uniform fire , Beau looked back at the tank as it swiveled again slowly and came to a stop .
tr	4	It seemed to take forever for the shot to come and Beau suddenly knew why , whoever was in that tank was alone .
tr	3	The man at the top of the turret didn 't seem to notice at first , just kept waving everyone on .
tr	1	The man inside cursed loudly and lifted the lid again and brought it down harder putting his full weight behind it .
tr	0	He appeared to be trying to talk to Beau , angry and defiant even unto death , but thankfully Beau was still deaf .
tr	4	He had previously come into the lock to scout those things out while his men had prepared defensive positions above .
tr	4	David was fascinated by these sets of gates which allowed ships to transit from different water levels between the lakes and the river .
tr	3	Nathan would personally initiate the attack and ordered no one to let their soldiers get out of hand and start firing before his signal .
tr	3	Nathan directed Harold to stay back while he and Captain Carter went forward to oversee the positioning of the troops .
tr	1	The water was running north , fast as rapids , carrying branches , logs , trees and other debris in its wake .
tr	3	Nathan had to stop and get control of himself , thinking for a minute that he was going to break down in tears .
tr	2	" No need to look so bad , " said Nathan , " it worked out , we 're okay . "
tr	2	Joshua shook his head , " It doesn 't serve much purpose at this point other than to kill a few more soldiers .
tr	2	Joshua and his team proceeded cautiously , not wanting to come upon any enemy or civilians who might compromise their operation .
tr	4	" There is no one here to protect the WTR 's eastern flank , our forces could push it back like a pillow . "
tr	4	Joshua left his men in the tree line giving them his weapons much as his father had so often before .
tr	2	" I certainly don 't , you 're just doing your job , but do you mind if I lower my arms ?
tr	0	Joshua smiled and started to ask about bringing his men in but the Captain grabbed his arm and drew him close .
tr	3	" That 's what I 'm talking about , you 're not alone in this brother , but I need your help . "
tr	3	If the WTR will just give us a little more time to take out that tyrant , we can peacefully resolve this .
tr	0	Chapter 3 -- Waking Up The first thing Beau Myers noticed as he started to come awake was that he could hear again .
tr	0	" You 're probably thirsty , " she said as she handed him a cup of water with a flexible straw .
tr	4	Beau listened for the sounds of gunfire or fighting but didn 't hear any so he guessed that was a good sign .
tr	4	A few minutes later , Amy walked back in with General Anderson and then returned to the hallway after giving Beau a smile .
tr	3	If I 'd been smart enough to think about it , that might have been our plan all along , but I didn 't .
tr	3	" It just kind a seemed like the right thing to do ... the only thing to do really . "
tr	4	Anderson stuck his hand out and the aide delivered them to him and then departed into the hallway , but stayed near the door .
tr	1	It 's killing him to be away from Janice now , but he 's afraid this whole JP business could unravel . "
tr	3	These interrogations , combined with the battle and Joshua 's information from the south , necessitated Nathan 's hurried dispatch to General Anderson .
tr	4	Despite the seriousness of the information he sent to General Anderson , he was surprised to see him at the dam within several days .
tr	0	Some warrant further follow-up , but the gem was a Captain Hamlin , who most recently worked on Sampson 's staff .
tr	3	I 'd rather not get into it , just trust that I got everything of use out of him . "
tr	3	" Sorry , " said Anderson , " but you need to start three days from now at the latest .
tr	4	" Well , " replied Nathan , " Captain Green is the logical choice and his company has yet to see action .
tr	0	Reggie walked back up to them and said abruptly , " Let 's talk about Beale and what you got out of him . "
tr	3	You need to know that your assassination attempt on my life failed , but it did cost my wife her leg .
tr	3	I don 't know what your plans are for those forces to the south , but you had better rethink them .
tr	2	" You know a lot of this would have been avoided if I had the right information , " Sampson muttered .
tr	2	Ethan , if things don 't start going right soon , I won 't have to look far to find someone to blame .
tr	1	With that said , I understand the importance of bringing all our resources to bear during this time of crisis .
tr	4	Even when electrical services are restored , I believe it is best to found our capabilities on what has worked for thousands of years .
tr	1	Also , individuals inside the WTR could provide information on what was happening there in addition to early warning of troop movements .
tr	1	With your approval sir , I would like to begin the work of establishing the Strategic Security Agency with the above basic guidelines .
tr	0	As always I am available for further discussion and would welcome any feedback or guidance you may have on this issue .
tr	4	" Maybe he went to get help or something , " said the mayor 's secretary referring to her now fled boss .
tr	4	Ladders and ramps were lifted over the side and the men were able to come ashore with no more than their lower half wet .
tr	1	The WTR troops responded with overwhelming firepower , putting machine gun rounds and grenades into any window or position that fired on them .
tr	1	By dawn 's light Brazen 's men saw the boats already in the middle of the Mississippi steaming back south .
tr	2	" Do you really think for a minute that you 're ready for the power that is coming your way ? "
tr	3	David saw members of the WTR camp come out of their tents and look to the north and others ran to get their weapons .
tr	3	They had thirty seconds to go and he saw that the camp was in pandemonium with dead and wounded lying among the tents .
tr	0	It also meant that a nearly solid wall of bullets awaited anyone from the camp fleeing away from David 's team .
tr	0	David hoped his men didn 't flinch from the plan which was to shoot anything that moved , and to keep going .
tr	0	David was torn between setting up a linear blocking position or a classic ambush along the main approach from the north .
tr	4	But he placed his machine guns along the main path since the majority of the survivors would likely come by that way .
tr	4	David started to introduce himself , but he heard one of his machine gunners say , " What kept you boys . "
tr	0	" I have a squad that will take us to a car hidden on a trail over that hill there .
tr	0	Sampson opened his mouth to yell at the man when he raised his arm and shot Sampson in the head with his pistol .
tr	3	The major smiled , took a step to the right and shot the next man in the head , his soldiers not moving .
tr	4	My name is Ethan Schweitzer , " said the small , older man while shaking Reggie 's hand in both of his .
tr	2	" Well , sir , we appreciate your overtures to us to end this conflict and are open to your proposals . "
tr	4	" Our dam is currently damaged and we do not know when it will be repaired or the electricity restored . "
tr	0	" We are willing to pay anyway with the belief that you will repair it and have electricity again , " said Ethan .
tr	3	" Actually , " said Reggie , " we only had one other point and that is toward future prosperity .
tr	2	Today he hoped was the day he could get back to somewhat of a normal life and look after other things .
tr	3	As part of the peace treaty , new territory was added to the JP including land south of the LBL .
tr	3	The initial thought was to simply create new counties out of the territory , but Harold thought wiser minds prevailed .
tr	3	The students and faculty came not only to help , but also stated they would stay until the problem was found and resolved .
tr	4	Although the lock doors were damaged , the crews were able to seal them shut , by permanently welding them .
tr	3	Harold thought the days of heavy barges transiting the locks were either long past , or pretty far in the future .
tr	4	Jim started to say more , but they heard the heavy grinding noise of one of the dam doors sliding open .
tr	3	About that time John came back up the stairs from below with a wide grin and nearly skipped up to them .
tr	2	Do not let what others say keep you from fulfilling what you were meant to do and are good at . "
tr	3	" Well , I 'm talking to you about it now , " said Anderson trying not to let his impatience show .
tr	0	It 's because I see you are making a mistake and I want to spare you that , but you 're right .
tr	4	Tell me Reggie , how did you feel when that moment finally came and you knew it was over ? "
tr	2	The war is now over , and it will take work for us to move forward , but move forward we must . "
tr	2	" Oh , I can 't see how you could lose sir , or who would vote against you . "
tr	3	These are exciting times , and proof that humanity can salvage itself out of the chaos and destruction that is all around us .
tr	1	" Thank you very much Mister Philips , for your time and your sentiments which I 'm sure most of us share today .
tr	4	He was able to listen in on the side discussions and report what he heard to his handler in the WTR .
tr	4	Although my expectations were low , I have been surprised by the amount of radio traffic and the information they gathered .
tr	3	All the major cities in the United States took at least one direct nuclear hit , and many more than one .
tr	2	His opponent had come out of nowhere , a former lawyer from Carlisle County who was willing to do whatever it took to win .
tr	0	Reggie was unwilling to do the same and most said that was what cost him the election by a very narrow margin .
tr	4	He had never considered himself needy or overly emotional , but the recent attacks had undermined his self-worth more than he admitted .
tr	1	As the crowds began to sit down in groups on blankets and lawn chairs , Reggie saw Brazen standing there smiling at him .
tr	3	" We keep talking about getting the world back to the way it was , back to the good old times .
tr	4	Reggie didn 't know if he had done a good job , but he knew he had done his best and it was enough .
tr	2	Not only was General Anderson out of power , but now that sanctimonious Reggie Philips was gone from the picture as well .
tr	2	Paul Campbell did what he was told to do , and he would continue to do so as long as Ethan held his son .
tr	3	Thinking about the future got Ethan 's heart racing and he decided that he would not go to bed early after all .
tr	4	The first draft was written in a rush between February and May of 2010 during free moments late at night or on weekends .
tr	2	I 'm working on the second book in this series Children of Wrath which I hope you get the chance to enjoy soon .
tr	4	But they were limited to what they could reach , and many casters were incomplete -- unable to touch all four .
tr	4	At least this way she does not have to frown over me each day and fret over my lost potential .
tr	4	Most did not even fight -- they would not resist the Empress ' will , even if her will was for them to die .
tr	2	The Orb was just a rock to a weaver -- it called for creation , beyond the shallow powers of the Brotherhood .
tr	0	The thought didn 't disturb him much -- how could it , when his wife already awaited him in the night sky ?
tr	3	By the time he 'd battled his way to the fountain , he was not in a mood to go around .
tr	3	He leapt up the stairs to the fifth level and burst through the door of his sister 's house without knocking .
tr	4	Maybe it was a sign , a message meant for him , because who but he would touch this stone ?
tr	0	The hunch of his shoulders and shadows across his face made clear that he did , but he merely shrugged .
tr	2	The gates close to visitors at dusk , you might have been locked out , so close to the Wilds , too ! "
tr	0	He had a decidedly uncomfortable hunch to his shoulders , but his face was as blank as a long-time gambler 's .
tr	0	" That 's because any day that starts with breakfast is a good day , and I always smell breakfast in the morning . "
tr	1	If he was surprised at her arsenal , Landon said nothing as he buckled his sword belt around his waist .
tr	1	Not watching his feet , Landon caught his toe on an uneven stone and staggered to keep from landing on his face .
tr	0	Landon gaped at the clearing , then hurried forward to catch up with Elaina on the narrow path that wound away from the clearing .
tr	1	At the inn she 'd thought him suspicious and strange , but now she saw what she 'd missed : he was dangerous .
tr	3	Shouldn 't have told him anything , but now that he knows ... " They 've never attacked me . "
tr	0	Landon thought his own father might have wanted more proof than just a bad feeling about a wall of leaves .
tr	2	How am I going to find what I 'm looking for if the nightmares on the doorstep are ready to eat me ?
tr	3	It had been a mistake to think the hardest part of his mission would be getting to the far side of the world .
tr	2	" You 're not going anywhere without one of us , Landon , or have you forgotten this morning already ? "
tr	3	There is no ignoring that many reports -- something is out there , whether or not it is after me yet .
tr	3	Years before the Invasion he had been told this road would lead to his death , and it would start with that simple question .
tr	2	On the other hand , who wanted to be involved with power like that , power that could kill before you saw it coming ?
tr	4	The pages were darker with time , and the leather had stiffened in the ten years since he had last looked at it .
tr	3	They stopped anyone from using it , which might be thought of as destruction , but it isn 't gone . "
tr	0	" I 've seen a caster fill a glass with water and light a fire just by looking at the wood . "
tr	0	We 'll likely know your strongest and weakest pillars by the end of today , if you manage to cast at all . "
tr	3	" Normally , new Guardians trained with an adept that was stronger than they -- just in case they lost control .
tr	4	He marched as if he knew each turn by heart , down to the number of paces between each one .
tr	1	Of course , each individual has their own tweaks : from weather and simple healing to growing plants and building with stone .
tr	3	If you want to move a rock , you can use Earth to control it directly , manipulating the nature of the thing .
tr	1	You can dry something either by moving the Water out , or by bringing heat -- Air and Fire -- in . "
tr	1	" When you say you 're going to move something by manipulating its nature -- don 't you mean just manipulating it ?
tr	4	Patterns can be broken down , dissolved , dispersed , but each little light you see now is all a caster can work with .
tr	0	A Guardian could banish the building blocks entirely -- there is no way to bring them back unless you have Guardians too . "
tr	4	It thundered and swirled , sucking her in , pulling her under and tearing her away from life even as she drowned in it .
tr	4	Colors sprang at her , vivid and new as if they had never been seen before by her or anyone else .
tr	2	The rock she was working on left the ground , to be sure , but only to explode in a hail of flying chips .
tr	4	If the enemy decides to pelt you with boulders or bury you with a mountain , you 'll thank me . "
tr	3	" Remember what it felt like to have the web snap that way , and try not to push it so far . "
tr	4	Casting that web felt like drawing a bow three times too strong for her , if the bowstring happened to be a live serpent .
tr	4	Instead of seizing and manipulating the web of the stone itself , her touch seemed to make it crack and dissolve entirely .
tr	3	In theory it is the same , but some casters build a block to working with certain items with any Element .
tr	1	It is a gift for seeing the current of the river that is Time and making predictions based on it .
tr	1	He shot a significant glance at Landon , who paled like a corpse and stuck one hand in his pocket , oddly enough .
tr	4	Keeping her comments to herself , she slumped into her seat at the table and began eating , eyebrows halfway to her hairline .
tr	4	A few were high stars , guiding lights from beyond the circle of the sea that led the People in a grander sense .
tr	0	It was hard to hide a fear of storms when you shared a bed with a man on a ship .
tr	4	He had ordered the best farmland strewn with salt , and then he claimed the greatest prize of all : the royal line .
tr	0	Its body was roughly the same size as the house , with wings that big again and a long sturdy tail .
tr	3	Despite the fact that it looked like scaly leather , Elaina discovered it was perfectly soft and smooth to the touch .
tr	4	CHAPTER 7 The Flight Elaina scrunched up her nose as she dumped the herbs on the table in a leafy , aromatic pile .
tr	4	Elaina set the wooden cup she 'd been drying down on the table while she watched him feverishly demonstrate what he ordered .
tr	3	With that he swiped the dried cup off the table , crammed his socks into it and squashed it into one bag .
tr	3	He wrapped it in clothes as he went , stuffed the lot into a bag , then crammed that into a cauldron .
tr	3	Earth , Fire , Air , and Water , then pulling them together for heat , light , mist , and steam .
tr	3	" I doubt it will be that simple , but it is to our advantage to know the enemy 's weapons . "
tr	3	" But that is not something we will need to worry on for a good long time , Truth protect us .
tr	4	Battling the weather to keep in dry and ready to use had been a chore , but she missed it .
tr	2	She focused , looking for the bright halo of Fire , but found only the dim sparkle of plant life .
tr	1	" It 's strange , " Landon said , examining their dinner , " I can 't tell where I hit it . "
tr	0	Rather than wait to be berated in front of Landon , Elaina said softly , " I 'll never do it again . "
tr	3	The water comes from a hot spring , so it will be warm though it is no deeper than this . "
tr	1	If one man blends in , then I 'll do as well as you -- only I can run if things go bad . "
tr	2	It didn 't make a whole lot of sense to Elaina , who didn 't understand how you could possibly bend light .
tr	3	" My father saw one fighting a man once , though it didn 't last long -- their battles usually don 't .
tr	2	Landon jumped down from his perch on an enormous outcrop of granite and knelt down to steady his elbow on his knee .
tr	0	Landon finished , " and has a better chance of getting away if he 's not worried about you . "
tr	1	Blinking away the purple haze that filled his vision , Landon looked to Elaina , mute horror filling his mind .
tr	0	A great dark circle was melted out of the snow , and standing in it was only one man , all in black .
tr	3	Landon sighed , tipping his head back to stare at the stars that pierced the velvet black of the night .
tr	3	Elaina nodded , took a deep breath that stung her lungs with the mountain chill , and followed him out into the tall grass .
tr	4	Any second she expected shouts and arrows or lightning bolts from the sky to descend on them , but nothing happened .
tr	4	There was a moment 's pause , then a voice rough with age called out , " Be gone , yeh pests .
tr	0	Raising his eyebrows , Landon checked the hills again , then hitched his bag farther up his shoulder and set off .
tr	4	On her hands and knees , shaking , Elaina was grateful to be free of that stare , even for a moment .
tr	4	Maybe she would die before they killed her ... A warm , rough touch on her shoulder broke into her peace .
tr	1	The sight made his whole body pulse and ache , as if it had been waiting for visual confirmation to start hurting .
tr	4	His red velvet cape was heavy with a broad band of gold embroidery at the edge , but he didn 't notice .
tr	4	He noted distantly the flash of resentment at his implication she was only called a Creator even as his rage grew .
tr	3	We sought the one who had the strength to defeat the Gift , the ancient Gift from this side of the Sea . "
tr	0	A hole in the ranks of the most powerful always was , sure as a hole in the ranks of soldiers in a battle .
tr	2	" Yes , as soon as you prove to me you will do me no harm if I release you . "
tr	1	Truth , but what did Landon think he was doing , running off like that when he was a Prince ?
tr	1	It was a long journey , and things had a way of going wrong if a person traveled long enough .
tr	2	Many of the homes had been wood and thatch , but she didn 't know enough about holding a building together to use those .
tr	4	Behind her gasps and murmurs rose until she could almost hear them , but there was no time to listen .
tr	3	CHAPTER 13 The Meeting The storm hit three hours later , and it did not let up for two days .
tr	4	The weight of the horses was enough to break the thin sheet of ice , so they did not lose their footing .
tr	4	It was his delivery that made Elaina want to laugh : that expressionless face , absolutely blank while he made some quietly acidic comment .
tr	0	The Falcon was in his sights , but any suspicion before that final moment would send her soaring away again .
tr	3	" We each take her wrist , maintain contact at all costs , and do not stop until the band is secured .
tr	4	Inside the stone circlet stone was curled a long chain of the same color , connecting the collar to matching bracelets .
tr	4	Of course , after the Linking they would both be her Watchers , and she could not ever escape them .
tr	0	A hammer and an anvil would not scratch it , and a natural inferno would leave it cool to the touch .
tr	0	She saw the glint of black steel in the doorway , saw the flare of a fireball for an instant .
tr	0	At last the one on her right flung himself across her body , pinning her with his weight from hips to knees .
tr	4	A hand reached out and gripped her ankle , getting tangled in the hem of her skirt for a moment before closing again .
tr	4	Elaina stifled her pleasure at having guessed what it was -- I 'd have rather been wrong and seen some way to escape .
tr	4	When she didn 't move , one of them sighed and both moved in to grasp her arms and lift her to her feet .
tr	3	" After many attempts , a way was found that joined them together , an inseparable bond that brought their minds and spirits close .
tr	4	Then beneath the pain something grew -- flashes of emotion that were not her own , memories she had never lived .
tr	4	In the name of Truth ... She had invaded their lives , forced a path where there should be none .
tr	4	The first time she had seen it with her own eyes , she realized , instead of through their own .
tr	4	His life had hinged on reading the expressions of others , and he saw her almost every hour of the day .
tr	4	All of them she referred to as " boy " or " child , " though most were three times her age or more .
tr	4	By itself that showed how peculiar she was ; nothing anyone did made him surprised or happy or anything else .
tr	1	He frowned at the sleeping form on the blankets , ignoring the biting wind that snuck in the cracks of their wagon .
tr	2	Then , in one smooth motion , he reached over one shoulder and stripped off his shirt without word or expression .
tr	3	It wasn 't against the cold -- though it was little warmer than before , but an effort to hide from that piercing stare .
tr	3	" My shirt was wet with the snow and ice -- I didn 't think that would be comfortable to sleep in .
tr	4	The next time she crosses the line , Brothers , we will be ready to do all that is necessary .
tr	1	The girl will be kneeling to kiss his rings in a matter of days , now , just as the prophesies promise .
tr	3	He didn 't quite grasp why that was , but that didn 't mean he wasn 't going to use it .
tr	3	The walk was not short -- the Brothers did not want to be bothered with the screams of the unfortunates unless they so chose .
tr	4	The camp 's blacksmiths looked longingly after the men that walked the other way as they worked the bellows or hammered red-hot metal .
tr	3	There was no need to heat the coals that stood in an iron tray in the corner either , Flame could do that .
tr	3	Only the actual contact with her skin had to be without it , would be without it , no matter what he tried .
tr	1	With one swift motion , the Firstborn made a slice down the middle to her naval , baring a pale strip of skin .
tr	4	She couldn 't stand to lose blood , skinny as she was , and there was no need to waste time before treating her .
tr	4	And if he slips up and kills her too , what 's to be done with the Prophecies I ask you ? "
tr	4	She felt if Death came for her now he 'd take one look and refuse to accept anything so pathetic .
tr	2	Only the thought of dismounting in only a coat in front of someone had motivated her enough to do it .
tr	4	No one else seemed to have noticed their entrance in the dimly-lit alcove by the door , as far as she could tell .
tr	4	He could come in the back way , and nobody 'd be the wiser if the lady couldn 't be moved .
tr	3	Like why the stars were sliding about so oddly just then , with little halos and bright trails behind them .
tr	0	Theirs was a peculiar sort of relationship -- formerly enemies , captive and captor , but now saved and savior and traveling companions besides .
tr	0	He was an odd man , yet she had not felt he was lying to them , or manipulating them at all .
tr	3	The column grew , no thicker than the trunk of a birch tree , she cast it high into the night .
tr	4	Sensing her attention , Cade turned and dark eyes met hers , but she could read nothing in them , nothing at all .
tr	0	The musician was gone , but a few patrons still sat about nursing their ale or wine and gambling over dice and cards .
tr	2	He kicked open the door to their room when he got to it , now using both hands to keep Elaina upright .
tr	3	Those filthy things she wore could not be comfortable , certainly not the coat on bare skin , but she slept just fine .
tr	4	Cade acknowledged , " but I thought it would be best if you were conscious , so that eliminates much of our time together .
tr	2	For a second he did not respond , then , " I will wait for you in the common room .
tr	3	Try as she might , she could think of nothing to say to him that didn 't make her sound like a petulant child .
tr	4	She would be off his hands and on her way to the exiles in no more than a week 's time .
tr	3	The uncomfortable thought occurred to him that he had taken quite a while to lift a finger on Elaina 's behalf .
tr	1	Even then it was spontaneous -- not a matter of courage and honor , but sudden freedom and frantic flight .
tr	1	Unless it was an especial skill of his , he would know no more than that until she cast something else .
tr	3	Elaina felt herself bristle at the implication that she was slowing them down , but that was absurd -- I am slowing us down .
tr	4	If he had said more than three unnecessary words to her in a week , it might have been as casual as it seemed .
tr	3	He ought to have paid more attention to her thorny silence , but it was too late by the end of that sentence .
tr	4	Elaina had reined in her mare to yell at him , and Cade wheeled his own mount to face her .
tr	0	With that she spurred her bay right past him , chin in the air and color high on her cheeks .
tr	4	Cade 's warning echoed in her ears , but she was careful not to draw as deeply as she wanted to .
tr	1	No one can know how strong I am unless they are going to be a span under the ground by nightfall .
tr	1	She babbled , trying to come up with something else with Fire and Air while her brain was spinning about anxiously .
tr	1	With one hand still tugging at her bodice and the other tangled in her skirts , Darin froze , grimacing a maniacal smile .
tr	4	Cade pulled her close to him , and suddenly she was sobbing into his shoulder as he stroked her hair .
tr	1	His web made it impossible to concentrate , I couldn 't hold on , and then I couldn 't do anything . "
tr	0	Hearing a Watcher apologize was astonishing , like watching a sheep and a wolf curl up together in front of a fire .
tr	3	Cade didn 't notice , now wiping off the black steel blade with the rag and tossing it back to its owner .
tr	0	As they had before , Cade and Elaina traveled from dawn until dusk , stopping only for a brief lunch at noon .
tr	0	Each day ended with a comfortable goodnight , and each day began with Elaina 's cheerful " Good morning ! "
tr	3	he asked offhand , gesturing to the horses , " It isn 't worth it to bring them aboard . "
tr	1	Wandering past broken-down nags and fine stallions , Cade approached a man with horses slightly less fine than the ones he was selling .
tr	4	With a practiced eye , he peered at their teeth , examined their hooves , and ran his hands across their chests and flanks .
tr	1	He said , " I can see you know how to use it , and it 's not my business anyway .
tr	0	Cade sauntered as casually as he could to a shadowed doorway , stripping one of the papers from the wall as he went .
tr	3	" They stopped the ship at the mouth of the harbor and searched the blasted thing from bilge to sails ! "
tr	0	He kept his head down as he paid , and he was back in the inn with Elaina in a matter of minutes .
tr	3	He didn 't want to ask her outright if she was literate -- it would embarrass her if she wasn 't .
tr	3	My brother was Prince of Doran , the plateau that rises in the east , so his went that way . "
tr	1	Cade said without expression , staring at his ring before he dropped it on its chain and tucked it back under his shirt .
tr	3	It was sweet somehow , that she 'd been looking out for both of them that way without saying anything .
tr	2	If you 're worried about the way you look , it is only -- " " Ever worn a camisole under your trousers ? "
tr	3	An hour later she was finished cutting out a pair of soft cotton trousers to wear underneath the street urchin 's .
tr	2	" You go first , " Cade instructed , " meander about like you 're looking for dropped coins or the like .
tr	4	The guard retuned shortly with another man in similar dress , only he wore wide bands of gold above each elbow .
tr	0	If that wasn 't scandalous enough , it ended well short of her naval , which had a strange tattoo around it .
tr	4	" There is a strange thing I have seen from the decks , " he continued , nodding toward the city .
tr	4	Cade touched his forehead , and replied , " May they shine on the waves for you and yours . "
tr	2	" Though some of them are not so young as that -- you look about the age of our oldest . "
tr	0	" Too late , " he hissed , yanking her back with the chain so that she tumbled onto her back .
tr	4	With a glance over her shaking form to the stillness of the wagon , Cade leaned over her to whisper in her ear .
tr	0	She laid a hand lightly on his shoulder , urging him to turn and face her , but he resisted .
tr	4	To his surprise , she huffed , " Only to get my teeth off your brother -- hardly in the realm of civilized behavior .
tr	3	" How do you take the worst things I 've done , the darkest parts of my soul , and make them light ? "
tr	4	We moved inland to defend the southern border and farm the good land , but we are of the sea .
tr	2	" I 'll tell you as we walk , " he said , nodding to the left down the cliff-top road .
tr	3	What sort of man lets his wife or daughter wander about with nothing but a strip of cloth across her chest ?
tr	3	That blouse , it you dared call it that , was so short it left at least four ribs visible below it .
tr	4	Every man alive recognized impending doom when a woman took that tone of voice , even one who had never married .
tr	3	There the great pier that curled along the rim of the bay and out across its opening was almost totally gone .
tr	1	Elaina quickly assured him , " I was just thinking how easy it would be to fix the harbor again . "
tr	2	Anything to avoid a rowboat -- I 'd probably have to climb aboard the ship with a rope or something , too !
tr	2	" We can look at that tomorrow , " she prompted , " for now let 's find a place to sleep . "
tr	4	The fountains were dry and the gardens full of weeds , but Elaina imagined that it had been lovely in its prime .
tr	4	She asked , looking to the eaves and the shutters while Cade shoved the old door open with his shoulder .
tr	0	He was a captain in the Great War holding a rise that would come to be called Jayden 's Ridge .
tr	0	Elaina said shortly , taken aback that this was a tragedy , " but all the others ended so well . "
tr	0	CHAPTER 28 The Harbor Cade waited until Elaina was finished with her breakfast of bread and a hard apple before bringing up the harbor .
tr	4	But perhaps , if we live , perhaps we can return one day and restore some small part of what was lost .
tr	4	" You are taller than I was then , so you 'll be fine standing there while I show you what to do . "
tr	3	Must be more out of shape than I thought , tiring out this way from just a little swim , Cade told himself .
tr	0	He couldn 't see her in the thick mist that filled the harbor , but he felt her shifting in his head , moving .
tr	4	Bracing himself with one arm , he lifted her onto dry land with the other in a single desperate lunge .
tr	4	Cade held her as he had by the creek after he 'd killed Darin , only this time he was the one who wept .
tr	0	She thought it had been long enough that she could speak of it ... Cade didn 't have to ask what had happened .
tr	4	Elaina could see he regretted it as soon as the words were out of his mouth , but she didn 't mind .
tr	3	The thought scared the skin off of him , but if she wanted to , he wouldn 't stop her .
tr	2	On the edge of the harbor an enormous wall of water was forming , towering halfway up the cliffs and growing .
tr	4	He shook his head , " To move the water , even , was more than I could have imagined .
tr	0	Her thoughts made her blush , and she changed the subject quickly , " So what is there to do on a ship ? "
tr	1	Spinning and leaping , water droplets gleamed like glass in the sunlight , streaming off their fins and long rounded noses .
tr	0	Among the extra canvas for patching the sails sat Elaina , back to the board and arms around her knees .
tr	3	Cade could see she hadn 't fully intended to say it , and it brought him to a full stop .
tr	3	I can 't cast a boat of Air for you , but I could freeze the water into ice and hold it stable .
tr	4	It might have been because her full lips were parted , or the smoothness of her skin , or those intoxicating eyes .
tr	3	The sea people had no use for land or plants , other than trees suitable for planks or masts that they could cut down .
tr	3	It 's a fantastic risk -- a little time won 't ruin us , but it may well save us . "
tr	1	It wasn 't just a clearing , it was a splendid garden , complete with an impressive portico whose columns dripped with blooming flowers .
tr	2	How did you know I was -- " she broke off as her gaze sank to Elaina 's limp form .
tr	3	" You may stay with her , but I can start preparing the tonic without the berries until Lidia gets back . "
tr	0	Frowning , Cade leaned forward and pulled from the sack a pair of manacles connected by a heavy iron chain .
tr	0	In a few hours she 'll be able to cast again -- of course , in a few hours that won 't matter . "
tr	2	" It was deadly difficult to get that wine to you unnoticed , not a lot of room for error there , love . "
tr	3	" Does she even know that it 's the traditional gift of a suitor to his beloved -- an offer of betrothal ?
tr	2	" You 're not listening , my sweet -- I am trying to help you , so I am not a problem .
tr	4	The sorceress ' face lit up when he said her name with its compliment , but settled back into a puzzled pout .
tr	1	If I ever see you again , I will kill him -- I 'll keep that promise , too . "
tr	1	I came so close to giving everything ... If I could have done it , I would have banished that woman .
tr	0	She knew her thoughts were as wild and scattered as a caged animal 's , but that didn 't change anything .
tr	2	Half of her wanted to collapse into those arms and not care -- surely I love him enough for both of us .
tr	2	" I had to do things I 'm not proud of , Elaina , I had to get you out of there !
tr	0	It was an agony of emptiness , a chasm that had split and dropped suddenly , and her world was gone .
tr	4	In the instant before she turned her back on him again , Cade saw his face reflected in her eyes .
tr	4	Elaina felt the tears spill over as soon as she turned her back on Cade and fled into the tent .
tr	3	The man was bound to me with no hope of escape -- he was just making the best of the worst situation .
tr	4	Her brief flashes of anger , of fury that he had made her think he might have cared , made her head ache .
tr	0	For a moment , he watched it fall with such pain Elaina almost knelt and snatched it back , but then his face cleared .
tr	4	The cousins were constantly at each other 's throats , even if they would defend each other to the death .
tr	2	Rylan dug the whetstone out of his belt pouch and reached over to his pile of things to draw a sword .
tr	2	It took him forever to turn his head to Elaina , who was falling at fraction of the normal speed , holding her throat .
tr	1	General Riesling felt his muscles weaken and blinked through the black specks and bright flashes that winked and spun across his vision .
tr	1	Just as the realization jerked through his sluggish mind Riesling sank to his knees , unable to stand any longer .
tr	0	Rylan stared after him as he heeled his stallion into a gallop , racing toward the horizon in an unwavering line .
tr	1	The prince pursed his lips in annoyance for a moment , then slowed enough to slide from the saddle and hit the ground running .
tr	4	She wanted to reach out and -- she jerked her hand back to her side , hoping he had not noticed .
tr	1	" Sorry , " she repeated flatly , tears rolling down her face , " You didn 't look sorry .
tr	0	He froze , searching the shadows , holding his breath so the clouds of vapor didn 't interrupt his view .
tr	1	The cot wobbled dangerously , but she didn 't notice , sinking back into the linens with a sudden chill .
tr	4	Cade blinked at the force of her suggestion , and she used his hesitation to babble on before doubt could take root .
tr	3	" She had no reason to tell the truth , and she was hardly looking out for our best interests . "
tr	4	" Well , she said it would be lethal , since the barriers dissolve ... to ... " Elaina stammered .
tr	4	If Cade had been the sort of man to blush , he 'd have been as dark as Elaina just then .
tr	3	He took it back from her and settled it carefully into the folded clothes beside a portrait a pretty young woman .
tr	4	He said nothing to her bubbling laugh while he led her hastily back to their tent , desperate for a thin scrap of privacy .
tr	2	Giving it was a gesture of devotion and an offer of marriage , depending on how or if the woman wore it .
tr	3	" I put it back on the night I sent you away , I 've never been an hour without it . "
tr	3	When they finally broke apart , her startled expression melted into the satisfaction of the cat that got the cream .

tr	0	Oxford University South East England January 3rd , 2026 Jan Colbert waited impatiently while a technician pounded away at the keys .
tr	2	" Not now , " she said quietly as she turned him , none too gently , towards the door .
tr	3	It had unusual red glyphs adorning the front of one of the shoulder plates that sat closest to its neck .
tr	4	Two kings instead of just one , I could be in bed right now while some other jerk picks up the slack .
tr	4	" The comms gear was provided by the Japanese Space Agency so NASA won 't get any egg on their faces .
tr	4	" Sam , how many bombs have been dropped remotely by some twenty-year-old kid sitting in an Air Force base somewhere in California ?
tr	4	" I seem to recall a future White House Chief of Staff being present with his dad 's gas can . "
tr	4	" Sir , " the assistant whispered , " we have a call for you from the White House press office . "
tr	0	Instead of an increasingly angry tirade about the lack of manners among short-duration cruisers , Frank was rewarded with a low whistle .
tr	0	He shook his head and stared out the window as a rival line 's ship sailed out into the Atlantic .
tr	3	They would rather show up on site and give last minute orders than simply ask for it to be fixed at the start .
tr	4	" Seems to me , that would have been a pretty good time to correct obvious errors in the layout , " Davidoff mused .
tr	4	" Sorry , Frank ; I must have pulled an old template when we drew up the bridge layout for Leviathan .
tr	2	You know , he 's still waiting to hear when you and Ellen can come over for some ' gator . "
tr	0	The War Room Washington , D.C. January 4th , 2026 Nathaniel Parnell walked into the room , followed by Sam and Mary .
tr	4	" Tall guy , sour face , chewed my ear off for ten minutes about a registry for mineral claims on the moon ? "
tr	2	I 'd believe you if you told me it was all some sort of mob front for money laundering . "
tr	3	Nobody was certain whether Parnell truly loved the Capitals , or whether he just thought it wise to support the hometown team .
tr	0	" Mr. President , Chuck has staff in Hilo and they 're probably arriving at the observatory on Mauna Kea as we speak .
tr	2	Pete McGregor walked into the control room with a bag of food , handing it to the Red Flag astronomer .
tr	1	I 'm glad to have someone else look at this ; I 'm worried that I might be losing it ! "
tr	3	" What ever reason it stands to , Pete , it 's not the one you 're talking about . "
tr	0	" Why do we always fall back on Hollywood and assume that an alien presence will automatically mean a violent invasion ?
tr	0	My predecessor had a policy of discouraging private capital from backing the concept and , frankly , I agree . "
tr	3	The way station then transfers the cargo to a second type of airship that 's designed to go into low Earth orbit .
tr	3	" How much can you put into LEO with those old engines from the shuttle , Chuck , seventy tons ? "
tr	1	" Tom , how much are we looking at , including the cost of getting these airships up and running ? "
tr	3	" Tom , did you just ask me to spend one and a half times our current national debt ? "
tr	3	No matter what direction this meeting takes , let it not be said that I didn 't start it on a friendly footing .
tr	3	" Half the world thinks it 's just another tabloid headline , the other half is stocking up on water and dry goods . "
tr	4	The rest of the world will hardly be keen on paying to provide the United States with such a potent force . "
tr	2	And the Chinese own a large portion of your national debt , she thought , looking down at the coffee table .
tr	2	He had thought the whole thing a joke or worse , a distraction cooked up by one of his subcontractors .
tr	2	" With a possible invasion just around the corner , would you want to spend a week or two stuck on a boat ? "
tr	1	" So , it 's either business as usual , a huge jump in business or a complete collapse of the cruise industry ? "
tr	1	" As soon as she 's finished tying up my boat , I 'll go down there and ask her . "
tr	2	It 'll be at least another six months on my current project before I would have to look for work .
tr	4	It was obvious that the PM had no clue who she was and equally obvious that he expected her to identify herself .
tr	0	" As you may have already guessed , it has to do with your rather unusual conference call on Sunday morning . "
tr	3	Perhaps the information itself is unimportant , but Dr. Colbert managed to determine it from almost no data at all . "
tr	0	And why , " his voice grew louder , " do we always label disgusting food as an acquired taste ? "
tr	3	Frank had sensed that Howard knew he was in the right , but the VP of Operations still wanted his head on a platter .
tr	2	Frank was about to employ some rather shocking language when a commotion erupted on the other side of the door .
tr	2	The VP of Ops no longer looked quite so smug , but he still couldn 't tear his eyes away from Frank .
tr	1	To Frank 's surprise they drove right through and onto the tarmac of Miami International after crossing over a rough patch of dead grass .
tr	3	Now , sitting in the Danish chair , still in the flight suit , Frank looked up at the row of portraits .
tr	1	" Mr. Bender , considering how much time you will be spending in this office , I think we can dispense with the formalities .
tr	4	" You want to ship me over there so they can beat me to death in front of a camera ? "
tr	4	Two months later , he had been beaten to death in front of a camera after refusing to read a prepared statement .
tr	3	The Oval Office Washington , D.C. January 11th , 2026 " They 'll try to use this to bring us down . "
tr	1	" So , what kind of ammunition will he use this morning and what will he hold in reserve ? "
tr	3	" This is going to be the most important conflict in human history and the Republicans are itching to be in the saddle . "
tr	3	" I think we can dispense with the fencing , Mr. President and come straight to the matter at hand . "
tr	2	" Mr. President , you propose spending a third of our GDP on a fleet that we won 't control .
tr	3	" There 's just no way for us to afford that and to build anything less would be foolhardy in the extreme . "
tr	3	This is not the time to worry about who sits in some office ; it 's not the time to worry about partisan politics .
tr	3	Can you tell them that they won 't wake up tomorrow to see a fleet blocking out the sun ? "
tr	1	" Bob , I have no military experience but this situation goes far beyond anything in human history , " he spoke calmly .
tr	2	" You 're hardly in a position to make threats or had you forgotten who holds the majority in Congress ? "
tr	2	If you hold up this bill , I 'll personally nail your ass to the barn door in front of the press . "
tr	4	" If you had asked me a month ago , I would never have thought to be considering something like this .
tr	1	Gary and Susan McKinnon had worked for two decades with the CIA , slowly growing disillusioned with every passing year .
tr	0	" The rest of your party is already aboard , so you can take off as soon as the bags are stowed . "
tr	4	I 'm going to be travelling everywhere our contractors operate and we can 't afford to wait for scheduling issues with other departments . "
tr	1	" You didn 't think I 'd take on a job like this without an experienced designer , did you ? "
tr	4	Now , two weeks later , he smiled at his wife as she dropped into a chair in his office .
tr	1	He turned towards his men , " This is Sergeant Wesley Davis , Corporal Rob Farquhar and Corporal Andrew Alexander . "
tr	4	He was running the colonel 's last sentence through his head and decided he didn 't like how it sounded .
tr	1	" They missed showing this to professionals ; that 's what they missed , " he said with a soldier 's disdain for amateurs .
tr	0	" Alien or not , you don 't cart ordinance halfway across the galaxy and waste it on mindless destruction . "
tr	4	She passed the ride in awkward silence and left as soon as the doors opened , turning to head for the cafeteria entrance .
tr	2	" I had meant to look in on you earlier , but we 've had a lot of work to do lately . "
tr	3	Frank stopped with the power adapter in his right hand and thought for a moment while his eyes drifted to Tim .
tr	3	" The first two airships should lift off in two weeks , the third will follow a month after that . "
tr	0	" We already have four months invested in that airframe ; it would be a waste to abandon it now . "
tr	3	" We can use the first three to move materials but we already have trains committed to that task . "
tr	4	We need you to get someone in here to raise the roof on Hangar Four and add a hundred feet to its length . "
tr	3	" Fabricating the world 's largest ship in fourteen months is our current claim to fame , " the contractor began .
tr	2	" But we had to do exactly the same modifications to our shops that you need to make on your hangars . "
tr	3	It was intended to shelter the colony in the event of a natural disaster that wiped out the main site . "
tr	4	Parnell pulled the second image from under the drawing , looking at it as Kelly folded the large sheet and laid it aside .
tr	3	Considering that we started out with almost thirty people , the chances are roughly twenty percent for any given individual . "
tr	3	It had taken a little over an hour to identify the owner of the contractor who had the expansion job at Moffett Field .
tr	4	Two weeks more had identified his major habits and the liquor store was identified as the best location for a carefully scripted chance meeting .
tr	4	" I do need a few extra employees , as it turns out , " the man replied , raising an inquisitive eyebrow .
tr	4	All private research partnerships had been temporarily suspended as the massive telescope became Humanity 's primary intelligence source for alien activity on Mars .
tr	4	His earlier hopes that the military would completely take over had come true but they had shown no interest in letting him leave .
tr	1	" This is Dr. Craig Pugh from Northwestern , Chicago and Dr. Hal Tudor from the University of British Columbia , Vancouver . "
tr	0	The enclosure also served as a ready room for a small security force that had arrived a couple of days ago .
tr	0	I had my standing orders and a captain 's prerogative to interpret and apply those orders as I saw fit . "
tr	3	It wasn 't lost on her that he had referenced his orders but had followed by stating firmly that it was his own decision .
tr	2	This was a man who took responsibility for his own actions ; more importantly , he was a man who took action .
tr	4	He knew he was engaging an enemy with over a century of experience fighting against some of the best navies the world had seen .
tr	1	" Probably because it is crazy , " Sam replied , his face showing his opinion of the designers at DARPA .
tr	2	" Jack , would you climb into one of these capsules and drop onto an alien world with four days of water ? "
tr	2	" For all I know , you probably do but it 's not the kind of thing you tell your press secretary about . "
tr	0	He was rewarded with a few chuckles and a couple of outright groans at this obviously lame attempt at humor .
tr	0	" Perhaps when we finish with them on Mars , we should pay them a visit on their own home world .
tr	4	Her question was politely rhetorical and the attendees moved to their seats as a complicated Gantt chart appeared on the screen .
tr	4	" Our next order of business should be to determine just how quickly we will have the means to fight in our own backyard .
tr	4	" When dad was posted to the South Pacific , I saw tribes where a headman ran the whole show .
tr	1	" And where would my little brother get his men from if not for glorified militia captains like me ? "
tr	4	Already , the keels of three massive airships had been laid and they were almost twice the size of the originals .
tr	1	Callum turned to see his employer , Lance , and looked down at the sandwich in his hand , nodding .
tr	1	" I think he went to check on a job in Oakland , " Callum said , watching her frown .
tr	1	" If you get killed , I 'm just gon na dump you in the harbor and claim I never saw you . "
tr	4	Turning , he could see Tony walking over while gesturing to the one photographer who 'd been given accreditation for this event .
tr	0	Tony was standing on a chalked ' X ' and waving at Frank , who joined him with a bemused smile .
tr	0	Now , looking up at module A-5 , Frank had a hard time imagining how many lifts were planned for the project .
tr	4	Every couple of months , the staff were sent down the mountain for a few days to clear their heads .
tr	4	Liam or not , she knew that Queen 's had the right program for her and so they had gone their separate ways .
tr	4	Has that been waiting deep inside my mind all these years , secretly poisoning every relationship I 've had since ?
tr	2	He trusted his people as far as he could , but only a fool laid out a plan like this for all to see .
tr	4	More importantly , he was aware that few of his helpers would be likely to stand up under a police interrogation .
tr	4	Though Kevin knew more than the others , he still had no idea what the strange shapes were meant for .
tr	4	He shrugged and went back to the cement mixer , tying a plastic sheet over the mouth before turning it on .
tr	0	The range , accuracy and rate of fire of a proper war bow was vastly superior to that of any musket .
tr	2	He got up and looked at the line for the first class washroom , seeing two of his fellow officers waiting .
tr	2	Frank almost rolled his eyes but he knew it would only help things if Chuck could stay in a good mood .
tr	3	Cal had spent a lot of time with the attractive young security guard , to the wry amusement of his comrades .
tr	4	Both men had needed to use the washroom rather urgently after several pitchers of beer with Lance followed by a circuitous taxi ride .
tr	4	They set off towards the hangars and noticed as they came around the corner that the planters were already gone .
tr	0	The top surface was a waxy material and Chuck pulled out a pen and broke through revealing a reddish powder .
tr	3	If we don 't disable these , they 'll put out enough heat to melt right through these columns and bring down the roof .
tr	4	Ordinarily , he would wake instantly but he felt like he was underwater and had to struggle to reach the surface .
tr	4	He looked down at the handcuffs and smiled as he realized that there was an intravenous needle in his right arm .
tr	4	After a moment of discomfort , the strips of tape came loose from his skin and the needle slid out of his vein .
tr	4	He started to help himself to the lunch , cutting off a large piece of pork loin before he set the knife back down .
tr	1	" She knew that McKinnon was planning something big for your visit and she had the entire place crawling with snipers and agents .
tr	2	I want our production sites locked down , and I want this kid found and buried head first out in the Sonora Desert .
tr	3	The suite took up the entire top floor of the small hotel and it was the size of a large two-bedroom apartment .
tr	3	" Don 't know what a regolith is and don 't much care to ; that 's why we want you along .
tr	0	Just put your name in and leave the narrative box blank , for all I care ; you 're a no-brainer . "
tr	3	Fortunately , they were not currently controlling the huge airship and , though startled by his impact , they were not unduly disturbed .
tr	3	He 'd felt suddenly certain that it had no place being there and that it would succumb to gravity at any moment .
tr	3	He was just in time to see the last thruster team maneuver into position at the starboard side of the ship module .
tr	3	" It 's no different from getting around inside this crew compartment , " Brad answered , still looking out the window .
tr	3	With no friction or gravity to fight against , you can get the job done with very little effort . "
tr	3	" The other advantage of using as little force as possible is that it 's easier to correct if you get it wrong .
tr	2	" I shut it off as soon as they were out of the hold , " he said to the men around him .
tr	4	He realized that computers were as fallible as the programmers who built the code but the software had extensive redundancies built in .
tr	4	" You only make coffee when you need it , " she said loudly as she turned and leaned against the table .
tr	2	" However it came to you , it came to you , not to any of the rest of us . "
tr	0	" You had an impressive flash of insight today and it may well be of great technical importance for us .
tr	3	I might miss something and get someone killed , but staying behind guarantees that I 'll miss everything that I might otherwise have caught .
tr	4	His tone was the only indication of his disapproval , the closest he 'd ever come to speaking against orders .
tr	0	Callum looked up as Mark Frey set his mug on the table and dropped into a seat across from him .
tr	1	" From what I read on a blog about it this morning , the Canadian version of French has been diverging for centuries .
tr	0	A UN flunky who didn 't rate a limo may well be a more useful target than an actual ambassador .
tr	2	The soldier took a hit to the forehead and looked up with panic to see another man lighting a second Molotov cocktail .
tr	2	Though the junior officer obviously understood that in the heat of the moment , it was no comfort to him now .
tr	4	His voice had taken on a new sense of urgency as he realized how close help was for the wounded .
tr	2	" What would happen , Major , if the crowd had broken through and come to blows with your men ? "
tr	2	" Father , we should get up ; the floor is too cold to sit on for any length of time . "
tr	0	I was all set to get him talking about what happened in Paris , and you went and changed the whole game . "
tr	3	He couldn 't put his finger on it , but there was something about Mark that set off alarms in his head .
tr	4	The warheads had been harvested from American Peacekeeper missiles and their modified casings lay in racks on the far wall .
tr	3	The script called for an emergency thrust to bring the main battery to bear upon a target that currently sat at forty degrees off-axis .
tr	1	The bow often contained smaller , long-range guns intended to interdict an enemy 's rigging or punch a hole in her hull .
tr	3	Frank looked out the windows in time to see turrets swing from the safety position to bear on the primary target .
tr	1	The gunnery officer spoke as loudly as possible without shouting , his German accent oddly lost as he raised his voice .
tr	4	To ensure this , the weapons integrators had devised an ingenious system using adjustable physical barriers in the traverse mechanisms of each weapon .
tr	4	" Yeah , she 's downstairs in the cafeteria having a coffee while I was finishing up some work here . "
tr	3	" The UN has fabricated the threat of alien invasion as a justification for taking over the countries of the world .
tr	4	The walk to her favorite table overlooking the East River always led her past conversations in at least three different languages .
tr	3	Stay out of the streets ; the blast might channel through the lower floors of the Secretariat and straight up the cross streets . "
tr	2	If we go down now , we 'll just get to the ground floor in time for the detonation . "
tr	4	Their secondary armament of .50 caliber machine guns kept up a continuous bass chatter , chewing the flimsy bridge structure to pieces .
tr	3	He stood in front of a patrol car with flashing lights , parting the stream of evacuees that flooded out of the main entrance .
tr	0	He weaved his way past a stopped cab and raced across Lexington , driving straight into an underground parking structure .
tr	2	Pieces of the ship , ranging from a few ounces to over a ton , continued to fall for over a minute .
tr	2	Jules would throw the money on his growing pile and a few hundred workers would be looking for new jobs .
tr	3	It struck just behind the wings , the force of the impact shearing off the tail and driving the rest of the aircraft forward .
tr	0	An array of lights and wires surrounded a chair in front of the screen and a camera stood on a tripod opposite the chair .
tr	0	Growing up in a low-income family meant that they returned shoddy merchandise that many families would have simply thrown away .
tr	4	The only difference is that the lock is adjustable , she mused , immune to Jarl 's excitement at having someone to talk to .
tr	1	A quick look in the rear-view mirror showed their captor standing in the middle of the alley with a gun in his hand .
tr	3	There 's a large building that looks like a power plant and then a bunch of big oil tanks to the left . "
tr	4	" Yeah , it 's about the size of a baseball diamond , " Ellen answered with relief , giving Jarl a thumbs up .
tr	1	" This , " he said , stabbing the circle with the marker , " is the origin of the signals . "
tr	3	" A lot of people think the Pueblo tribes can trace their roots back to the great Anasazi civilization . "
tr	3	" People tend to point their ground penetrating radars at the ground , not at the back wall of cave cities .
tr	2	The victorious humans had then closed off the opening and built a small collection of buildings to house the warriors chosen to guard it .
tr	3	This will be the first time they get to study an intact ship , though it 's obviously made by a different civilization . "
tr	0	The airship that had carried Frank into orbit was also loaded with the first of the carrier 's breaching assault vessels .
tr	0	" Alright Frank , that 's as far as we can take you , " the pilot said over his shoulder .
tr	3	The gesture was unsettling for Frank until he realized that this was how they talked without having the entire shipyard listening in .
tr	3	After a quick confirmation that it had control of all eight thruster units , he started them moving out of the hold .
tr	2	They passed through and stopped in front of a second door while they waited for the outer door to close .
tr	0	That didn 't mean that he was an actual army major but it did give him a place in the hierarchy .
tr	0	He realized that he might have to carry through on his bluff and that it might be a good thing .
tr	2	McCutcheon looked as though he was considering whether it would be worth the wait to fly Mike 's cousin to Hawaii .
tr	1	Mike turned from the table , noticing the Canadian and American Echelon officers were giving the colonel an indignant look .
tr	1	" I wish Dad had that kind of faith in my abilities , " she grumbled , keys clacking in the background .
tr	0	Much had changed over the last year , but the blast had more impact than any other factor in changing the organization .
tr	1	A group of men stood in the shade cast by the building , a mix of uniforms and civilian clothing .
tr	3	Frank was no astronomer but he knew that Mars wouldn 't see this side of the planet until shortly after nightfall .
tr	0	A man had wandered over to Frank as the hybrid aircraft was wheeled out of the hangar by a ground crew tractor .
tr	4	He smiled as they shook , nodding at Frank 's name as if he had known it before coming over .
tr	4	" If there 's no magnetic field , " the young engineer continued , " there probably isn 't any life anyway .
tr	0	A man sat at a terminal labeled ' flight control ' wearing a headset and looking intently at the readout in front of him .
tr	3	" Got a control subroutine mixed up but it 's an easy fix , provided the aircraft is still under control . "
tr	2	Sixty Meter Observatory Mauna Kea , Hawaii July 3rd , 2027 McCutcheon stood up and looked around the boardroom table .
tr	3	Having proven her ability to contribute to the team , she had insisted on making that immunity permanent for any existing legal entanglements .
tr	3	" At first , we thought it was some sort of security mechanism , but it was hard to believe . "
tr	3	" I give you comedy gold with bit by bit and get nothing , but a little slapstick gets you laughing ? "
tr	3	Basically , that would be an update of the little bits of software that do various things throughout the ship .
tr	4	Now he had to wonder whether the colonel could sell it all the way up to where the decision would really be made .
tr	4	The man 's eyes were always on the move and he carried himself like someone who was ready for action .
tr	0	After several months in Calgary , he had grown a beard and shaved his head , looking like half the construction crew .
tr	4	" Y ' know , Tim , " he roared across the table to be heard over the noise of the crew .
tr	4	The army specialist threw the vehicle into gear and they lurched away , swinging around to head for an opening in the trees .
tr	0	The Flood Tide Low Earth Orbit UNS Hannibal January 15th , 2028 The ships lay in an arrowhead formation , like migrating geese .
tr	2	He had no hope of keeping track of who ran which country but they all seemed to know who he was without introduction .
tr	4	The two men abandoned their conversation and moved out of the way , giving the rest of the room a better view .
tr	2	Hopefully , they would survive long enough to send their vital signal and , hopefully , that signal would throw the enemy into confusion .
tr	4	The spread had been checked by the end of the second week but by that time almost half the crew had fallen sick .
tr	2	We 'll be so far out of range , and so quickly , they won 't even worry about us .
tr	3	I wasn 't sure at first but that briefing you did on the alien system left me with no doubt . "
tr	3	" Wait , does that mean that you guys ... " The signal cut off as the timer ran out .
tr	3	A constant buzz came from the twenty Gatling guns as they spit out a hail of 30 mm depleted uranium rounds .
tr	4	" I figure the chances are roughly even , but that means they might get one more shot at us . "
tr	3	" You know , I think the galley switched from grounds to crystals last week , " the captain mused .
tr	3	" You might be happy drinking out of a colostomy bag but I 'll wait till we get home , thanks . "
tr	2	They 're coming in hot and using the atmosphere for deceleration so they can get into action without a long slow approach .
tr	2	The admiral looked up from the operators and screens in front of him , craning his neck to look up into the analysis cell .
tr	2	" A couple of things , Sir , " McCutcheon drifted down to float in front of the fleet commander .
tr	4	" She put a hail of 30 mm depleted uranium rounds in the path of the incoming projectile and one of them impacted .
tr	0	Programming work done in leisure back on Mauna Kea might carry the one small flaw that would undo everything they had planned for .
tr	3	" At least one still in the fight , the other three aren 't turning to face us , though . "
tr	0	Now the flight officers in the stern of the small ship touched hands to their helmets as a signal came through .
tr	0	He stopped on a raised catwalk that ran for several hundred feet , overlooking what had to be a rail gun .
tr	4	Are they a different species or do they engineer the genes of their clones depending on the job they were grown for ?
tr	2	One of them walked over and stopped in front of him , using his wrist pad to change his radio to proximity mode .
tr	4	Nodding , he shuffled over to the one alien who 'd been stalking back and forth in front of the others as they worked .
tr	4	By that time , rounds from the fleet were almost on top of the enemy and she raised her shields .
tr	1	" All ships , this is Admiral Gao , " the second in command stated calmly , using the fleet circuit .
tr	4	All vessels direct your fire on the bow of the enemy ship and we 'll get him to drop his shield . "
tr	0	The Achilles was slowly gaining steam as she closed on Zulu Alpha Three , spitting a hail of metal in front of her .
tr	0	" I was trying to collate some data from the boarding parties and I want you to take a look . "
tr	4	The shelter had more room per person than they were accustomed to but they had no work to keep them occupied .
tr	4	" As long as one of the shuttles is still passing through the shield , we have an open link with all three . "
tr	3	It was a brutally elegant solution , using the shield to initiate the blasts as well as contain it against the enemy hull .
tr	3	Now , he had to fine-tune that analysis to include the waypoints that the infantry would use when they hit the ground .
tr	4	He reached his compartment and unlocked the hatch , swinging it up and into the upper part of his small space .
tr	3	By the way , Major , it 's a discretionary thing but you might prefer to refer to me as Gunny .
tr	1	They will be joining our battalion reserve company and Gunnery Sergeant Simpson will act as lead NCO for the company . "
tr	3	They had not bothered to bring logistical vehicles as the terrain was simply too rough for anything that didn 't walk or fly .
tr	2	We found the wreckage of an Osprey up here , passing it up to the coordination team as Foxtrot Four Alpha One .
tr	0	" That 's on your head , big man , " he called as Simpson dragged him back and took his rifle .
tr	1	The night sky was suddenly filled with sound as though a thousand giant linen sheets were being torn slowly in half .
tr	4	This time the sound was deeper and the single line of fire streaked more slowly towards the ground but it was still deceptively fast .
tr	4	He held his 9mm automatic out , aiming at the right side of the tunnel mouth where he expected their visitors to appear .
tr	0	He realized , with a thrill , that the man had been carrying what appeared to be a C7 assault rifle .
tr	3	He didn 't want to run the risk of getting shot by the soldiers who had come to take them home .
tr	3	" If that 's the case , then my recommendation would be to follow the plan that you already came up with .
tr	2	Almost instantly , the sound of automatic weapons fire echoed out through the ruined roof of the bunker where he now stood .
tr	3	Seconds later , a similar thump to the right indicated that a fire team had reached the next bunker in that direction .
tr	3	UNS Ares Mars Orbit March 13th , 2028 Jan stood , magnetically rooted to the hangar deck with her heart in her throat .
tr	4	Five letters that could mean the death of someone I can 't possibly let go of -- dead or alive .
tr	3	The jaws of the main clamp grasped the hull of the small transport and pulled it down into the fully docked position .
tr	2	" If you 're looking for Captain Kennedy , he 's on his way into surgery , " the NCO told her .
tr	4	He checked his suit pressure and was amazed to find that there were still no holes after two close hits .
tr	3	Surely they wear their suits ; they would just have to put their helmets on but at least it will hamper them .
tr	1	The young man grinned , and the men of his command , Americans and Swiss alike , hooted at his silly humor .
tr	2	" I should get some food first , all those coffee packs are eating a hole through my stomach . "
tr	4	He had always disapproved of such liberties and so he drifted past them to find one of the heads near the forward battery .
tr	4	The men of one squad were hovering in a rough circle as he drifted past , small crumbs floating around them as they chewed .
tr	4	A pretty woman with long black hair gave you the tin and made you promise to come home in one piece . "
tr	3	" I wouldn 't drag God into this , " the sergeant said absently as he shifted his attention to his other armpit .
tr	1	" First time in five hours I 've had a chance to sit , " he said with a happy grin .
tr	3	They can push production a hell of a lot faster than us so we have to try to beat them on the science . "
tr	4	" We have a list of fringe physicists who are about to find themselves drafted into the service of their nation . "
tr	3	It 's the kind of community that folks usually buy into on their own without the added incentive of saving the human species . "
tr	3	" I have to get it out of my system before I step in front of the press , don 't I ? "
tr	2	" Makes you wonder what went on in this room during some of history 's great moments , " Kelly mused .
tr	3	She picked up her bag and started towards the low stone wall separating the pasture from the grounds of a thatched , stone cottage .
tr	3	He had a better life here , with his mother 's family just down the hill and Liam 's sister at this cottage .
tr	4	Meanwhile , politicians will argue , engineers and physicists will analyse the captured vessels and companies will leverage the new technology .
tr	0	On the third day , he whimpered through the morning hours , begging wordlessly for help and strength from his absent Mother .
tr	2	Across town Bellamy Jones walked out of his house the morning of the sixth day and felt something crunch under his foot .
tr	1	She tested him again , delving his mind for ambition , testing his fitness for the office of the Seventh Principality .
tr	4	The clouds were constant here -- the will of the Empress made it so , and as such there was no circumventing the fact .
tr	4	She had promised she would ... and then he would go to see for himself , one way or the other .
tr	4	He decided to let her speak first and so remained stationary , staring out his balcony doors , feigning ignorance of her presence .
tr	1	He heard a rustling as she shifted in surprise , again sending images of dark scales and a sinuous form though his mind .
tr	4	The message was only a single sentence , and a brief one at that : Await My Presence in the antechamber .
tr	1	Automatically , the Prince fell into a defensive stance as the first man came for him , his training taking control of his body .
tr	4	He stepped quickly inside the man 's reach , grabbed his wrists , and broke them with two sharp blows .
tr	3	With two quick motions , the Prince disarmed them , and with a third hamstrung them with a sweeping motion of the dagger .
tr	1	A pounding in his head , a sickly sweet scent in the air and salty , metallic stickiness on his lips .
tr	3	The Prince , not knowing what to do , started to crawl toward the man , pulling himself forward with jerky , half-formed motions .
tr	3	He tried to speak , but a choking , gasping sound was the only thing that managed to escape his throat .
tr	4	He stood up , came toward the Prince , drew back a heavy booted foot , and smashed it into his chest .
tr	1	* * * The Prince woke to a dull ache in his head and too bright of a light shining on his closed eyelids .
tr	2	He rolled over to hide his face -- and rolled right off the bed onto a rough wooden floor with a painful thump .
tr	4	And when I say does not react well , I mean you 'd start vomiting all over me and then die .
tr	0	The man whose voice he had heard was no man but a giant -- that was the only way to describe him .
tr	3	" It 's certainly finer linen than most of what even the Most High would wear , but it 's torn and dirty .
tr	0	" All of that on top of his name being taken away ... " " Death Watch , " finished the big man .
tr	1	" No use talking if you can 't keep a civil tongue in your head , " the big man said .
tr	0	The girl straightened up and also eyed the Prince , with a bold , frank audacity that was simply infuriating .
tr	2	Abruptly she turned and crossed the room to the corner next to the door , and knelt on the wooden floor .
tr	4	They stopped when the sun set , and the Prince was untied from the saddle and deposited under an overhanging outcrop of rock .
tr	4	He 'd need to keep her at a distance if he fought her , and only close when he was sure of a strike .
tr	3	With a start the Prince realized the girl had rounded the fire and was standing in the shifting shadows not far off .
tr	0	Yet it was as big around as the Prince 's arm , and perhaps would have been more properly called a small log .
tr	2	For personal reasons having to do with trouble my conscience tends to give me , I wish to do so without harming you .
tr	0	He whipped his head around and glared at her , letting out a growl as an added sign of his disapproval .
tr	4	A long pause fell between them , and the Prince barely dared to breathe lest they realize he was awake and listening .
tr	4	There was a sharp whistling sound that filled the air from all directions and immediately both of the Exiles converged on the Prince .
tr	4	The Prince 's physical strength , eyesight , hearing , taste , touch , smell , speed , all were doubled .
tr	3	A chill went up the Prince 's back that had nothing to do with the fearful nature of the thing before him .
tr	3	That 's impossible , the Prince thought in alarm , I just felt it a moment ago , where is it ?
tr	1	The Prince rolled to the side as his vision narrowed ; stars winked in front of his eyes as his body cried for air .
tr	4	The skeletal face of the monster split into a smile of ghastly glee as it raised its sword once more .
tr	0	A bare second later , both head and body began to decompose , creating a stench that was truly horrific .
tr	4	" That was close , " said the girl , who had retrieved her daggers and stood surveying the scene around them .
tr	2	A soft twang followed by a whistling sound reached his ears , and he dropped to the floor without hesitation .
tr	3	The Prince seized his chance and attacked , striking out with a quick thrust to the Watchman 's arm , hoping to incapacitate it .
tr	3	He frantically tried again , but his ankle shook so violently that even with his added strength it wouldn 't let him rise .
tr	3	It stood towering over him , the ax clutched tightly in its right hand , savoring the moment and the Prince 's helplessness .
tr	4	" Don 't lie , " he said , quietly , and then fear and anger took over and he was shouting .
tr	1	His clothing was ripped , but his armor and his helm gleamed brightly , shining in a stray patch of sun .
tr	4	The Prince looked up into the face of the Watchman through a red haze that had settled over his vision .
tr	1	" Come , " he rumbled , pulling the Prince , limping on his bad ankle , along with him .
tr	2	Memories of making love to her , of their young children and his pride that his son was growing tall and strong .
tr	4	Even if Mother had stripped him of his name ... even if he was being hunted ... no , he was a Prince .
tr	0	He shook his head , dispelling the doubts in the blazing light of the revelation that his Mother had not abandoned him .
tr	3	They were both staring at him with an intensity that was enough to make his stomach do a nervous somersault .
tr	2	The girl stood up , looking offended , and the Prince was afraid he 'd gone too far too fast .
tr	4	the Prince asked , letting some of his annoyance show ; the girl was infuriating , there was no need to feign that .
tr	3	" I promise that as long as I am in your captivity I will not attempt to contact the Empire again .
tr	2	I will warn you should an ambush occur , or if we are about to run into a patrol of soldiers .
tr	4	All of this I swear by my Mother 's name , by the Children , and the Light that they serve . "
tr	2	Should you break your promise , I will end you , Prince of Ravens or not , before you can take your next breath .
tr	1	" I can accept that , " the Prince said , when it became clear she had no intention of continuing .
tr	0	In truth , it was no less than what he had expected , if far less than he had hoped .
tr	4	After all , did not the Empire prove to him in spectacular fashion that he is no longer welcome among them ? "
tr	4	A long time passed before she spoke again , but when she did , it was without breaking eye contact with the big man .
tr	2	The Prince shook her hand , which was cool and calloused , no doubt from years of work with her daggers .
tr	4	The journey took a week , and each day , in accordance with their bargain , the Prince was given a new freedom .
tr	1	And then , slowly , the realization sank in that the big man was talking about nothing more than pinecones .
tr	2	He looked around for wood , but there was none , so he was forced to wait for the two Exiles to return .
tr	4	" No one for at least a mile , " he replied , " and probably not beyond that either . "
tr	3	You perform the act , but it means nothing -- to you it is no more than cutting away an unwanted piece of thread .
tr	1	I know it as you never shall , and my life is tied to it as you should wish yours will never be . "
tr	2	She stood there looking at him , eyes round and mouth open in a small " o " of surprise and shock .
tr	3	The Prince waited patiently as the girl tied him to the trunk , then sat down as she left to get firewood .
tr	4	" She went to get firewood and never came back , " the Prince replied , keeping his answer simple and direct .
tr	4	When they had finished eating , they all pulled out their blankets and found a patch of ground on which to sleep .
tr	1	Someday I will be Prince of the Seventh Principality , and I will need to deal with Exiles such as this without pity .
tr	3	And suddenly it occurred to him that he didn 't know what it was the girl and the giant had been Exiled for .
tr	4	Close to noon , they emerged from a dense thicket of trees to find themselves on a ridgeline that overlooked a city .
tr	3	This Inner City was made of towering stone structures that stretched high into the air , spearing the heavens with their spires .
tr	2	" Death Watchmen are notorious for following a trail to its end and only reporting once the task is complete . "
tr	4	Some time passed , he wasn 't sure how much , in which he simply stared at her , unable to look away .
tr	3	He would contact his Mother and he would return , triumphant , having passed the test and proved himself worthy .
tr	4	The image of the Prince 's attack flashed through her mind , and she , grudgingly , marveled at how well trained he was .
tr	4	He dropped to her side and picked up a dagger , which had been lying on the forest floor beside her -- her dagger .
tr	2	" And what you have done is allow an innocent boy to walk into the open arms of his murderers .
tr	0	He looked around wildly , breathing hard , and after a few confused seconds saw another falcon two houses away .
tr	3	The auctioneer spoke again , and this time there was outright laughter , though the Prince couldn 't make out what was being said .
tr	2	She flitted from shadow to shadow , and moved past the door with the compass on her way around the slave auction .
tr	2	The man motioned to the wide glass doors at the end of the room , and turned away , obviously dismissing him .
tr	2	But no such noise came , and he made it across the room and through the large glass doors without incident .
tr	2	On the other side of the doors on a dais in the middle of a wide , sloping yard was a golden coin .
tr	1	He grasped the coin , pulled it out and thrust it into his pocket , silently chiding himself for almost missing it .
tr	4	With each step , the light in the distance grew brighter , and soon he was able to lower his hands .
tr	0	A little farther along he found that he was indeed in a long passageway - a downward sloping half-circle made of cobblestone walls .
tr	2	The floor was nothing but smooth , hard packed dirt , and his simple Commons boots little impression on it .
tr	2	But such contemplations were lost on him : all he was worried about was tripping over actual stumbling blocks , not metaphorical ones .
tr	1	" I was informed we had a very promising Child of the Light seeking us along the Path , but I am ... . "
tr	4	The Seeker motioned to a guard - of which , the Prince realized suddenly , there was now only one .
tr	3	" Please , my son , do not attempt to make this more difficult than it has to be . "
tr	3	" Could it be , " the Seeker asked , " that you thought this was all a test ? "
tr	4	But the Seeker was shaking his head , and the look of pity was turning to something else ... changing ... into laughter .
tr	4	Reality ceases to exist and the walls in front and the ground beneath seem to recede and are felt no more .
tr	4	He wanted to lose his mind , but some last shred of himself - whoever he was - kept him clinging to sanity .
tr	1	He slept again in fits and starts , his mind going in and out of consciousness with no apparent preference .
tr	4	the girl asked , " we stored the Searchers -- " " No doubt my cell is enchanted , " the Prince said .
tr	0	He fell flat on his face , slapping his hands against the ground to absorb the shock of the blow .
tr	4	The Prince rolled to his feet , crouching over the guard , staring into the frightened eyes of the man .
tr	4	He looked around , confused , and realized he was high up one of the towers spaced along the wall of the Inner City .
tr	0	" Catch me if you can , " she said with a grin , and shot off down the runway .
tr	3	It took him a moment to realize that the girl had turned to the door , but couldn 't get it open .
tr	0	When he was still a good ten yards above the rooftop , his hands gave out , and he fell backwards .
tr	1	The Prince turned , and saw the big man was holding a hammer he 'd found in an equipment rack .
tr	4	There was a loud clatter of metal , and then the shackles fell away , and the Prince was free .
tr	3	A beat passed , and then both of them dropped the skin , which the big man caught and tied to his waist .
tr	1	Soon they were past the last houses and shops , and crossing the large grassy area that surrounded the city to the south .
tr	4	They were all panting for breath now , and the Prince felt as though his heart might fail from sheer exhaustion .
tr	4	That journey had been defined by his need to escape from the same Exiles who were now his one chance of survival .
tr	3	Part of him was watching with disbelief at what he was doing , but the larger part of him felt that this was right .
tr	3	This was a debt he had to repay -- and this was the least he could do to fulfill that obligation .
tr	3	He slid the dagger into the belt of his borrowed clothing and looked out at the city again , trying to hide his disappointment .
tr	3	He understood : she was uneasy , and coping for it by talking too much about things that didn 't need to be discussed .
tr	4	He tried to rise , but his body decided not to obey him , and he fell back down again .
tr	4	" You do not need to be frightened for me , " the Prince said , his voice formal and stiff .
tr	3	The big man stopped next to the Prince , and lowered himself to the ground to sit next to him .
tr	1	The Prince shrugged his shoulders as if he could throw off the voice like it was an irritating fly , nothing more .
tr	4	" When I came into the throne room , my superiors were there , and every Blade Master then living .
tr	0	Assassinations were carried out by the Death Watchmen , and as far as the Prince had known , by them alone .
tr	1	" As you 'd guess , I was surprised , but as I was then I did not question it .
tr	4	But in the end , once enough time had passed , I took a new name , one that I chose for myself .
tr	1	" I thought you said I was free to make my own choices , " the Prince said with a wry smile .
tr	3	It 's easy to mistake the marks on his back that way , and no doubt it would be taken very seriously .
tr	4	" I didn 't mean to be so frank - I didn 't realize you were speaking to me . "
tr	2	So let 's try and be good boys and girls who don 't fight too much between ourselves , yes ? "
tr	2	" So use your anger to conquer those , and once you do , then you can worry about conquering the anger . "
tr	3	" I remember quite distinctly trying to club him to death for telling me what to do with my life .
tr	4	Though , chances are we 'll have to go around the east side of the Lake , since there 'll be no one there .
tr	3	There were two whittled things - one that had many teeth and one that had a flat bit at the end .
tr	3	" Then choose to do something about it , " the girl said , slightly exasperated , but still trying to be reasonable .
tr	3	" Look , I don 't understand how the Talisman works , I don 't understand what it feels like to use it .
tr	3	But if you 're convinced there is no good that it can be put to , then stop using it .
tr	2	He looked at what the Prince was doing , nodded once , and said , " do it this way . "
tr	4	" Came on you in the night , we did , " said one of the Defenders , apparently in answer to his question .
tr	3	The Prince hit the ground and struck out with both hands and both feet , whipping around in a circular motion .
tr	4	He pushed himself even harder , passing through the forest so quickly he left whirlwinds of leaves swirling behind him .
tr	3	He was studying the grassy ground of the forest to his right , not wanting to look at the two Exiles .
tr	3	" For what it counts , to survive that as the man you are , you 're stronger than I will ever be . "
tr	1	" No , " the Prince said , deadpan , " I fell unconscious due to the strain of saving you .
tr	3	She undid the final strap holding the litter in place and it fell to the ground in a clatter of wood .
tr	2	I don 't know how she got into those things ; someone must have had to pour her into them .
tr	0	" Wait , " he said to other two , " did you say there was a stream nearby ? "
tr	3	" It 's that way - though why you want to go when it 's getting so cold is beyond me . "
tr	3	They held the gaze for a long moment , sharing a joy and elation that made the Prince giddy just watching it .
tr	4	She was facing away from the Prince and he couldn 't see her face , but her voice sounded resigned and ... sad .
tr	3	The giant didn 't speak , but instead turned away from the girl , and they both began to get ready for bed .
tr	1	The Prince sat staring into the fire for a long time , wondering what he was going to do when morning came .
tr	4	However , it soon became apparent that they still weren 't being followed , which surprised all three of them and made them wary .
tr	0	She shifted slightly , and as the sun hit her from another angle the Prince 's breath caught in his throat .
tr	3	They rode around the lip of the mountain before dipping down into a small valley that split into two paths at the far end .
tr	4	But when they kill you , when you watch them slice you open with no remorse in their eyes , then you 'll understand .
tr	0	It was clothed in blue and white armor and a cloak that flowed like storm clouds , gray and misty .
tr	3	It flew completely straight , as if a force was pushing it directly through the intervening space toward its target .
tr	3	But where the creature had stood was now just a blasted heath , and in the sky the scattered clouds of a dying storm .
tr	3	" Now that , is a complete and utter fallacy that I will not accept , particularly coming from my sister . "
tr	3	" The Elders will take us to task for ruining what was just built , " said the large woman .
tr	4	He realized he had fallen behind the group of Exiles and she had fallen back as well to talk to him .
tr	2	And I should tell you that once you 've gone over the pass , you won 't be able to come back . "
tr	0	He pulled hard on his reins and the horse came to an abrupt stop amidst a small cloud of dislodged snow and earth .
tr	4	" I think so too , " the girl said , " and then we can give them our report in person . "
tr	3	The Prince did as told , all the while grateful to have something to do to keep his mind off the situation at hand .
tr	3	" You said most of the sabotage goes unnoticed , but what about the things that do go noticed ? "
tr	3	But here , in the woods , with just a stew and a giant for company , such things seemed remarkably unimportant .
tr	4	Because the glow he felt was the distant glow of the Prince of Oxen , at the head of an army .
tr	1	The boiling , sickly feeling that had formed in the pit of his stomach like a seed slowly sprouting was directionless .
tr	0	Such a deed that had not , in a thousand years , been achieved by a single man , woman , or Child .
tr	0	When they finally reached the sparring arena , the Prince saw that it was located amid a huge barracks and training ground .
tr	0	The arena itself was a large stone building , capped by a dome that was painted with various murals of Kindred fighters .
tr	4	the Prince asked dubiously , eyeing the razor sharp edge and remembering what Leah had told him about the metal .
tr	1	The Prince dashed away , using his greater agility to avoid the giant sword as it hissed through the air behind him .
tr	4	The Prince turned to see Leah standing just outside of the practice ring , fingering the hilt of one of her long daggers .
tr	4	" You never let me spar with you before , " he said , " why the change of heart ? "
tr	2	The girl dodged away , daggers flashing , constantly moving , catching the light like birds flitting through a ray of sun .
tr	0	Their bodies spun and their weapons clashed , striking out again and again , neither able to land a blow .
tr	3	At this thought a crack appeared in the hard , bitter hate that had formed in him the night before .
tr	0	If the Prince of Oxen found this place , marched on it with his army , he would crush them all .
tr	1	The Prince was surprised at how controlled and emotionless his voice came out , considering the turmoil going on inside him .
tr	2	And then the big man nodded , stood , and moved quickly off toward the arena door , the Prince following close behind him .
tr	2	The sword fell from his fingers and hit the ground with a clatter , followed closely by the loud thump of his body .
tr	3	It felt suddenly heavier than it had in the arena , and the Prince knew it had nothing to do with the actual weight .
tr	4	The man was taller than the Prince , back straight even in age , and had dark blue eyes that commanded his obedience .
tr	4	The Prince raised his sword to dispatch the man , but before he could move , a voice spoke behind him .
tr	2	" I have no time to ask for absolution , nor do I much care if you would grant it .
tr	0	A small gold knot of rank on the upper right side of his chest shone brightly in the light of the hall .
tr	3	Two-thirds of those gathered were men and women with bows strapped to their backs and short swords sheathed at their waists .
tr	4	They were all clad in thick leather armor , with thin , rectangular pieces of metal sewn on to offer protection against light weaponry .
tr	0	As he came closer , he saw that she was talking quite animatedly with a man mounted on a white horse .
tr	3	" It 's a fortress built around a city that contains all of the history of the Kindred , " Lorna said in compromise .
tr	4	It has documents dating back to the early years of our nation , when we fought against the Empire in earnest .
tr	3	The Prince 's gut told him it wouldn 't be that simple , but he had to admit it seemed like a good plan .
tr	3	It will at least slow them down , and give us some time to get out of here without losing any men .
tr	3	The Prince 's sword lanced out and hamstrung the man , tripping him and two others who had tried to follow .
tr	4	Her lithe body twisted and turned with a dexterity and finesse that made even the most skilled swordsman look like a hapless lumberjack .
tr	4	The Prince looked up and saw the Kindred firing arrow after arrow from the ledge above them , but it was nowhere near enough .
tr	2	" Good -- because now I 'm going to kill you for being a stupid , foolhardy slip of a girl ! "
tr	0	The last thing he saw was Leah 's look of horror , as the world caved in around him and swirled into blackness .
tr	3	He breathed a large sigh of relief that sent a small jolt of pain through his body but did no more than that .
tr	1	He bent to an unconscious man lying next to the Prince and began to unwrap a bandage from around his eyes .
tr	2	The Prince caught a glimpse of a rough wooden door opening onto what appeared to be a dark balcony over to his left .
tr	0	But the pain died away in the next second , fading to a harsh but manageable ache , and he stumbled forward .
tr	2	The Prince had risen from his corner and begun to move toward the door on the far side of the room .
tr	1	" I 've been wounded , captain , " the Prince said , " and that 's no concern of yours .
tr	1	The man tensed , the Prince 's manner apparently enough to convince him of his own inferiority in this situation .
tr	0	The Prince ran for him , and as he came closer , he saw that the big man was working at a makeshift forge .
tr	4	But then the moment passed and they remembered that they were in the middle of a siege that could begin again at any moment .
tr	4	She turned and searched the street suddenly crowded with soldiers , all bristling with spears and swords , gleaming in their silver armor .
tr	3	The sound of arrows being shot from the force manning the wall continued , but it slowed the ram not at all .
tr	0	" Hold this , " was all he said , and then he was darting straight toward the Daemons , Leah right behind him .
tr	0	the Prince called back , cutting down a man who had forced his way forward , but leaving him alive .
tr	4	The Prince let out a fierce shout that was taken up by the Kindred around him , and they ran after the red-eyed Ranger .
tr	4	A cheer went up from the Kindred , and their attack redoubled , the Imperial army forced all the way back through the gates .
tr	0	With a painful roar of agony , the Daemon fell back , an enormous ax blade buried in its side .
tr	0	There was a heavy crunching sound , and the dark figure came out of the shadows and into the torchlight .
tr	1	" Oh ... I 'm sorry , " the Prince said loudly , his own lips lifting , but in contempt .
tr	4	But in the center of it all , standing head and shoulders above every other man and woman there , were two giants .
tr	1	The Prince 's hand was clutching the hilt of his sword in a cramped fist , his entire body throbbing with energy and life .
tr	0	With a resounding crash , the Prince of Oxen shot past him and straight through the side of the building .
tr	4	He rolled behind a pillar , got to his feet , and ran for the other side of the Temple .
tr	0	" What , " the Prince of Oxen said , " this is all about Mother taking away your name ?
tr	0	He launched himself forward once more , sword light as a feather in his hands , and pushed his brother back across the room .
tr	1	It was pouting over in the corner all alone , trying to look dignified , but succeeding only in looking ... well , stupid .
tr	1	" And brought him back , " a voice said from the door , " which I find more interesting . "
tr	2	You did not help the Kindred out of loyalty , and you did not do it out of belief in our cause .
tr	2	You turned against your society , your nation , and even your family in order to do what you thought was right .
tr	0	And so it was an easy thing for you to bring him back -- he was a part of you .
tr	0	" It wasn 't your sword , " said Elder Crane , hands folded behind his back , a strange look on his face .
tr	2	It is information that is known only to myself and the members of the Council of Elders , with perhaps a handful of others .
tr	4	In any case , once you were born and found to be a viable Child of the Empress , she had your father killed .
tr	4	The big man , face white and eyes wide , nodded his head the barest fraction , and the Elder continued .
tr	0	The Prince looked up at the big man , whose face was now a mask of grief and pain as well as unquestionable shame .
tr	4	" He did , though it was kept secret , " Crane responded calmly in the thundering silence of the room .
tr	3	But more than that ... I will make no secret of the fact that you are the hero of this battle .
tr	2	The Council unanimously decided that should you wish to leave us , it is only right of us to let you .
tr	1	" We think you absorbed it along with his life , " Leah said , speaking slowly and watching him closely for his reaction .
tr	2	No one knows how large the nation is , though the population has varied throughout the reign of the Empress .
tr	4	Though it goes without saying , " The Legend of Zelda " video game franchise as well as its characters are owned by Nintendo .
tr	0	A visible wave of heat waves lazily , streaming up and out of the worn grooves of a thousand horse drawn carriages .
tr	1	Hanging from his shoulders is a black cloak donning the royal crest on both the front and back in faded gold stitching .
tr	4	The priest has told the story several times , casualties of the plague of darkness brought about by the dark lord Ganondorf years ago .
tr	3	Not waiting for anything in particular , just endlessly waiting for the night to fall , and the dawn to break .
tr	3	A young girl in the group calls as they collectively march out of the structure with an air of superiority .
tr	4	Peeking through the single opened door , a rapid series of anxious breaths are halted when the sentry breaks the silence .
tr	4	The people need a symbol of hope now more than ever , and his tired old face is far from reassuring these days .
tr	1	" I told you not to hide from us , " Rho shrugs , his stoic face especially intimidating in the fading light .
tr	1	Waiting hopelessly , Rift grips his music box tightly behind his back , afraid sliding it back into his pocket would be noticed .
tr	0	Straining to catch a wayward throw , Rift fails over and over again as the children continue to taunt and tease him .
tr	2	A heavy swing landed on the bridge of his nose as Rho nearly managed to knock him out with his trusty sword .
tr	1	Tears of pain welling up in his eyes , Rift weakly grabs at his face while Rho dangles his music box over him .
tr	1	The remaining children begin to run for the bridge , only to be cut off by a bony hand springing from the earth .
tr	1	Scrambling to his feet , Rift finds Rho gripping his sword tensely , unsure if he should fight or run .
tr	1	The dry grass crunches beneath his sandals as Rift sprints toward the group of hoodlums , desperate for some level of security .
tr	2	Unsure what he should do , Rift moves forward slowly , utilizing his dark clothing to fade into the shadows .
tr	3	The hostile foliage seems to dare him to come closer as it returns to its passive stance , waiting for its next victim .
tr	0	Proceeding through as carefully as he 's able , Rift holds his throbbing arm , failing to fight the tears of pain away .
tr	4	Somewhere in the distance , past the aggressive plant life and over the buzzing insects , he 'd swear he hears music .
tr	0	Tripping forward , the boy has less than a second to collect the appropriate amount of dread as a massive gorge fills his vision .
tr	3	Through the thinning mist along the wall of his loft , Rift spots a fairy bobbing along an uncertain path .
tr	2	Jogging through the valley at a steady , but cautious pace , Rift occasionally loses his footing atop the weaving roots underfoot .
tr	4	Moving around the corpse as carefully as he would if it were still alive , he soon stumbles upon yet another leafy cadaver .
tr	1	Delighted to find some degree of civilization , Rift advances forward , stopping short when his foot collides with something warm .
tr	4	Regardless of what he may find inside the temple , he is certain it can 't be as bad as the forest itself .
tr	1	Passing through some sort of invisible portal , he only realizes how incredibly noisy the forest was now that all sound has ceased .
tr	3	Moving through the room as quietly as he 's able , Rift notices a strange pedestal standing in front of the door .
tr	4	The upper-left portion of the helm seems to have been recently reconstructed , the section plagued with cracks and crevices .
tr	1	His dark armor does little to deny his probable sinister nature as he rests both hands on the blades sheathed on his thighs .
tr	1	A series of sandals lightly striking stone sounds as a small squad of assassins drop from their imperceptible hiding places high above .
tr	4	In the instant between heartbeats , the shadow is upon her , staring into her very soul with its red eyes .
tr	4	Frozen in fear himself , Rift clings to a large hunk of rock , remaining concealed for the time being .
tr	4	Her skintight , blue jumpsuit seems to let go of the darkness ' embrace like a pair of lovers forced to part .
tr	1	Faking a low , scooping swing , he suddenly changes into a spinning , vertical backslash , aiming to cleave the man in two .
tr	0	He hadn 't heard the man in green catch up to him with a cry that echoed throughout the realm .
tr	4	The pyramid the Triforce once rested upon ceases to be discernible , the only source of light twinkling from the dimensional doorway behind them .
tr	3	Spinning through the portal , and past the massive staircase , the sword spears deeply into the wall next to Rift 's hiding place .
tr	2	The glyphs and symbols from his helm begin to slowly spin about his head , his power continuing to grow exponentially .
tr	0	Thoroughly amused , the dark man chuckles at his misplaced bravery , crossing his arms and waiting for the pathetic attack to fail .
tr	1	Unable to find the willpower to do anything at all , Rift sits with his knees to his forehead , hugging his shins tightly .
tr	1	Whipping his vision to the right , he finds the Princess ' outstretched arm , her palm glowing with a small , golden triangle .
tr	4	Preparing a second ball of fire to be thrown , the Princess fails to notice the dark energy forming around her feet .
tr	4	Tearing the sword from the hero 's grasp , he summons another vortex of energy before punching the tested steel to pieces .
tr	0	A conjured bow in hand , she has summoned an arrow of vibrant light , squaring up the shot carefully .
tr	1	The vacuum finally relents , the portal closing completely with a brief wink of light as it fails to claim a victim .
tr	4	Sprinting across the open air , large glyphs of purple light form beneath his feet , ushering him back into the fight .
tr	1	Unsure if he should stay or run , Rift 's brief moment of calm has passed as the duo draws closer to him .
tr	3	The majority was kept intact to sustain my imprisonment , " she reveals , a substantial bitterness lingering in her words .
tr	1	" I know how you feel , " he admits , trailing off as his memories drift to Rho , jabbing at him mercilessly .
tr	4	" If you 'll help me , I 'll never leave you , " she expresses , her words conveying her genuine feelings well .
tr	1	His disclaimer of bravery was no ruse , but still , he can 't help but try his best to impress the mysterious woman .
tr	3	" I don 't know , " Rift admits , thoroughly uncertain of his athletic prowess , though he 's never truly tested it .
tr	0	Dangling at different distances and lengths , a plethora of thick , ropey foliage sways gently from the canopy far above .
tr	0	With a panicked scream , he tumbles downward , all of the available vines just out of his reach as the fear takes hold .
tr	0	At the far end of the valley , thick overgrowth blocks what must have been a passageway a long time ago .
tr	3	Straight through here , then left , " she continues to instruct , the music swelling with every hollowed trunk they pass through .
tr	3	The architecture is of a minimalist nature , the colossal trees serving as multi-story apartments , but only altered just enough to be inhabitable .
tr	2	" You don 't mean , " Mido starts , losing his voice when Fado 's eyes latch onto him for the first time .
tr	3	A large tongue slaps against the drooling interior of the plant 's mouth knocking bits of small woodland creatures out from between its teeth .
tr	4	Before he even thinks he 's close enough to be attacked , Rift hears Mai shout , " left ! "
tr	3	Suddenly , gravity grabs hold of his gut as his foot dives through the earth as if it isn 't there .
tr	1	The droning noise of wildlife is much harsher in this dim world , the entire setting seeming to have a darker tint upon it .
tr	0	A small archway of stone is wrapped in an embrace of dark vines , leading to a bridge spanning toward the temple .
tr	4	" We 'll just have to start checking everywhere , but if you get lost just ask me where we 've been .
tr	2	Growing out of the wall above the doorway , it would certainly have claimed the life of anyone passing through without Mai 's warning .
tr	3	" Sorry about that , I didn 't see it until the last second , " she admits , sounding flustered herself .
tr	1	" Sure was , " Mai agrees , " at this rate I 'll be slowing you down soon , " she satirically implies .
tr	3	Without missing a beat , Rift strolls right up the leafy predator , patiently waiting for him to try and exit .
tr	4	Searching for the source , he is horrified to see the bones slowly rolling into each other , pulled together by some unseen force .
tr	3	Pulling his right leg out of the mud , Rift shifts left , the tip of a large spear nearly grazing his torso .
tr	1	Tossing his temporary glove aside and pulling the arm guards on , they fit surprisingly well , stopping just past his elbow .
tr	1	Feeling significantly tougher , though he possesses no fighting skills , Rift throws an awkward punch to show off the gear .
tr	4	Whispers dance overhead , the population of thieves making no effort to draw attention , but remaining interested all the same .
tr	0	Dangling from the man 's clinched fist , the mythical helm he thought would lead him to his infinite power .
tr	1	I 'm of a mood , " he grumbles , slapping his mistress ' hand away to angrily remove his armor himself .
tr	2	Sensing the mood in the room , one of his favorite girls shyly approaches , hoping to put minds at ease .
tr	1	Guiding Light : Distant Dreams and Simple Shadows Hyrule field glows with an aura of possibility in the midmorning sun .
tr	0	A large gathering in the market square grabs her attention , the noisy group bantering angrily around the guard captain .
tr	4	" A few kids were out playing in the field yesterday , " he explains , a sad expression pulling at his face .
tr	4	Rows of preparation tables line the center of the room , the large , cast iron pot resting coldly over the extinguished fire .
tr	0	Hiking up her lavish dress , she marches up the spiraling staircase to the king 's chambers , high above the main floor .
tr	1	The vision grows increasingly intense and the Princess suddenly snaps out of her trance to find it has grown dark .
tr	3	An irritating cicada chirps at the starry sky , the stone architecture of the elaborate courtyard seeming to glow in the moonlight .
tr	3	The bottom of the well is an unpleasant sight , the distorted brick walls and dirty paths leading outward in a maze of darkness .
tr	1	" You kept me waiting , " Ilia sighs , setting her knitting aside as Link strolls through the door .
tr	1	" Someone has got to step up when evil strikes again , " Navi shrugs , apathetic toward Ilia 's emotions .
tr	3	A brief grunt followed by a long sigh is all Link can utter , his outstretched arm finding nothing but the door .
tr	1	Before he can climb to his feet , Link spots the heart-shaped mask , drifting toward him and filling him with dread .
tr	4	The large eyes and colorful spikes protruding out the sides bear down upon him just as the earth below opens up to swallow him .
tr	1	The sun has already begun its descent into the west as Link 's nap continued much longer than he 'd planned .
tr	4	Eventually , touched by his efforts to find her , Navi has returned to his side and has remained ever since .
tr	1	With his empty scabbard and heavy shield resting upon his back once again , Link exits his house with determination .
tr	0	" It 's alright , " she shrugs , touching his arm and tracing her fingers down to his hand .
tr	4	Grabbing hold of his shabby , leather glove she squeezes it between her hands before looking Link in the eyes .
tr	2	Though it is so much more than most men could dream of , the life of a rancher holds no appeal to him .
tr	4	The once level room takes on a noticeable slant as the oncoming water shifts the balance of the floating temple .
tr	4	Almost to the door , a sudden gush of the pale green liquid splashes onto the sole lantern , leaving the room in darkness .
tr	4	Climbing from the death trap on his hands and knees , he shakes his soaked arms briefly before searching for his next objective .
tr	0	The water doesn 't pause for an instant , already pouring up through the open doorway and invading the large room .
tr	4	" The door to the second floor is locked , " Mai reveals , trying her best to remain calm .
tr	1	Nodding in agreement , Rift doesn 't realize Mai 's comfort is the only thing keeping him from panicking and making a critical mistake .
tr	0	The extraordinary amount of debris and foliage makes it look as if a giant wrecking ball smashed its way through centuries ago .
tr	3	Climbing through the maze of debris , Rift reaches another standing pillar , but can find no clear path through to the chest .
tr	0	The old , circular slabs of stone lie piled into a wall with a plethora of plants and trees making the obstruction impassable .
tr	3	Far too small a window to capitalize on just yet , he stands his ground , waiting for the next assault .
tr	4	The water hasn 't slowed down for a moment , the entire room quickly consumed by the pale , green waves .
tr	3	" We 're running out of time , " Mai announces , attempting to spur a little more initiative from the boy .
tr	4	" Hey , we don 't back down from a challenge anymore , " she points out , sensing his reservations .
tr	3	The top of his foot splits through the rising torrent with a large splash as he soars further toward his goal .
tr	4	Nearly toppling off the roof in shock , he takes a passive sort of defensive stance , unsure how to proceed .
tr	1	Spinning around , the razor-sharp teeth are already closing in on his neck , and with no warning from Mai , Rift feels helpless .
tr	1	Not wasting a moment , the second beast lunges in , slashing diagonally across the boy 's back with its claws .
tr	1	The scent of blood finds the beast 's nostrils as it circles away , ushering it back in for the kill .
tr	1	Though he is intimately familiar with the feeling of regret , the sensation boiling in his gut now is completely new .
tr	3	Rift 's palm glows brighter than ever before , the swirling vortex consuming time itself as the gauntlet concealing it turns transparent .
tr	1	With no time to react , Rift vanishes from its vision , reappearing after tilting himself horizontally and thrusting his arms upward .
tr	1	His eyes fade back to black as he holds his head , and the sting of pain across his back returns .
tr	4	You took them both out without even needing my help , " she reveals , sounding excited up until the last few words .
tr	1	With that , Rift leaps forward , the wind whipping across his face as he falls just short of his goal .
tr	0	A dashing leap allows him to continue forward , adrenaline charging through his veins as the bridge begins to collapse all around him .
tr	0	Mai shouts , grabbing his hand and spinning along a diagonal arc , throwing him back toward the lofted path .
tr	1	Not pausing for an instant , he continues to sprint forward , every section traversed quickly falling in his wake .
tr	3	Rising to a sitting position , he watches as the temple disappears beneath the frothing drain of the disgusting bog .
tr	1	" I hope the next one is this fun , " Mai chirps , prodding an unintentional smile on the boy 's face .
tr	0	An ugly spray of sap and saliva splatters against the wall of earth as the carnivorous sprout is detached from its stem violently .
tr	1	A jolt of anger quakes his spine recalling the relentless Link chasing him down , and stabbing him once again .
tr	0	Her orange hair and red eyes convey a natural sensuality , though the fear and angst they currently display is far from comforting .
tr	1	Partially hidden beneath the shifting sand and tumbling bits of broken , mystical material , a blue medallion shimmers in the sparse light .
tr	4	The generally tame wildlife near the castle grows increasingly hostile , and yet another premonition of dark days on the horizon invades her thoughts .
tr	3	Each day proves more difficult than the last , " the Zora holding the net of fish responds , his face stricken with frustration .
tr	1	" It 's been so long , " he admits with a sad laugh , briefly wiping at his eyes .
tr	4	Link and I tried to stop him , but he 's shattered it once more , " she reveals , holding up her hand .
tr	1	This is news too dire to be kept from him , " he insists , giving her a brief hug .
tr	3	Moving through the heart of town , she bypasses the well and climbs a short flight of stairs to a recently renovated building .
tr	4	Inside the store has a very dark and uneasy ambience , odorless green and purple smoke slowly climbing through the room .
tr	3	Satisfied with her wide-eyed gasp , the man continues out the door letting it drift shut on its own behind him .
tr	1	With no sword to wield , Link stands ready just the same , hoping his senses are simply playing tricks on him .
tr	1	Despite the stranger 's suspicious actions , both Link and Navi realize his only intent is conversation for the time being .
tr	1	A rich , agricultural nexus , the ranchers fit right in , though they longed for their abandoned land and distant friends .
tr	1	As she climbs back to her feet , Link quickly follows suit , attempting to calm his horse 's nerves .
tr	1	" Take care , " she quickly insists , stepping closer and wrapping her arms around his torso in a brief hug .
tr	3	Though there is something almost mechanical about her strict adherence to obligations , Rift notes she is both pretty and kind .
tr	1	Quickly snatching his silent music box off the ground beside his makeshift pillow , he climbs to his feet with a brief stretch .
tr	4	Feeling distinctly awkward , he wanders out of the barn himself , unsure how to leave without being excessively rude .
tr	1	There is a sincere generosity in her words , lost in her compulsions as she 's no time for such pleasantries .
tr	1	Quickly realizing he is intruding , Rift shuts the door as quietly as he 's able , proceeding back downstairs with a sad expression .
tr	2	Moving toward the open field beyond the barn , Rift spots a farmhand busily scooping fodder with a hay fork .
tr	3	A steadily approaching trajectory of hoof prints have locked onto his path , now leading all the way down to the structure 's entrance .
tr	3	Normally not the type to take notice of such subtlety , the boy grows excited to share the information with his companion .
tr	0	" A lack of balance , " Mai sighs , clearly having been over this idea in her mind a thousand times .
tr	4	It sounds reasonable , but this order of life cannot persevere without a strict level of balance between the elements .
tr	2	A soft arm hooks around his own , and for just a moment , Rift forgets he is talking to a spirit .
tr	4	At this rate , Rift cannot help but wonder if he 'll be able to see her in the coming days .
tr	4	A large hole in the ground served as the entry point , but their ambush clearly ended poorly for them .
tr	3	Failing to notice anything out of the usual at first glance , upon further inspection Rift spots a faint gleam of sunlight from behind .
tr	3	Trotting across the sandy floor of the pit , he spots more footprints moving to the center of the area with a steady stride .
tr	2	Come on , I want to show you something , " she urges , not wanting him to lose heart .
tr	2	Opting for the left door reveals a larger room with several arching paths leading downward into sporadic pools of water far below .
tr	3	There is a calm and captivating aura about the room , but the water below seems anything but inviting to Rift .
tr	1	Dashing forward , Rift unwittingly avoids a fierce swing stabbing into the rocky ground , totally focused on finishing his wounded prey .
tr	1	Still staggering in pain , the crab loses its footing , falling onto its face as Rift leaps into the air .
tr	4	A sickening crunch echoes through the cavern as the gauntlet easily smashes the thick exoskeleton with a heavy downward punch .
tr	1	The mighty swing hits much harder than anticipated , and Rift finds himself flailing through the air , toppling completely off the arching bridge .
tr	1	Closing his eyes and bracing for impact , Rift feels a sickening and disorienting pull of gravity in several directions at once .
tr	0	In a terrifying second , the man tears the hook from the wall while drawing a broadsword from its sheath on his back .
tr	3	Scrambling away , Rift can feel the gust of wind from the blade , still saturated with bits of defeated crab .
tr	1	Already moving in for the kill , Link is taken by surprise when the boy slaps down on the twirling metal with both palms .
tr	1	At the last possible moment , Link whips his blade over his shoulder , opting for a backslash as opposed to the advertised strike .
tr	4	Quickly rolling beside the large doorway , he presses his back against the cool stone , briefly peeking into the sunlight .
tr	4	He can 't help but wonder how terrible Mai 's sisters must have been to treat her as they did .
tr	1	" Come on , don 't be like that , " Rift goads , still growing increasingly relaxed with his occasionally charming partner .
tr	4	The thin line , long since crossed over when power ceases to be strength , and mutates into a hunger .
tr	3	A thousand piercing bolts of judgment riddle his body , forcing him to submit to an entity greater than himself .
tr	4	The king of thieves will not find any more sleep this night , the vivid dream still etched onto his eyelids .
tr	4	" You will be given a choice , " he states flatly , pausing to be certain the next line is heard clearly .
tr	4	The dozens of women who line the path to the throne emerge onto the balcony as well , each of them carrying an instrument .
tr	1	As his hands rise to call for quiet , the lutes and oboes quickly fall silent along with the drums and gossip .
tr	3	Not caring for the emotional outburst , or the intensifying theatrics , Ganondorf decides to put an end to it .
tr	3	The thirst for destruction beginning to burn inside him as what little sympathy he had is slowly strangled to death .
tr	1	His hands not his own for this instant , Ganondorf blinks across the small platform faster than any in attendance could perceive .
tr	3	" You are becoming troublesome as of late , " Ganondorf starts , attempting to size up his difficult yet loyal subordinate .
tr	0	A mighty blaze burns in the distance , and though it appears stationary , Zelda feels as if it is crawling closer and closer .
tr	0	I bought you another potion , " she pleads , quickly breaking down , yet maintaining an air of grace about her .
tr	4	Oh , I 've waited so long to see her again , " he expresses as his eyes begin to water .
tr	0	It is a true heart , and a just compass that leads a ruler down the path of a prosperous kingdom .
tr	3	His tired grip lets go for the last time , and it is the final push toward her uncontrollable tears .
tr	3	The woman formerly chasing the thieves stops in her tracks , instantly recognizing the woman with such a potent ability .
tr	2	Though most of the children instantly look ashamed , a couple grow wide grins , considering the accusation a complement .
tr	3	Watching the multitude of faces light up is all the confirmation Zelda needs , and with that she calls an end to the meeting .
tr	4	It 's been all I could do to keep an eye on the children , " she admits with a shrug .
tr	4	Her hero has been just as burdened as she , and suffered the same twists of fate and inconvenient obligations his whole life .
tr	1	Though it began palm down , indicating his need for help , it has slowly turned upright , subtly asking her to join him .
tr	4	Clouds of dark crimson gather overhead , their presence dwarfing both the figure within the void , and the wall of fire .
tr	2	Doubling over and glancing down at her soaked form , her heart skips a beat to find her body covered in frigid blood .
tr	1	" If there 's anything I can do to prevent something like that happening again , I need to know . "
tr	4	" We were outside when the sun set , " he starts , looking for a questioning glare in Zelda 's eyes .
tr	4	" Several people spotted your hunk ride into town and visit the castle , " she informs with a mischievous smile .
tr	3	I do not know what they plan , but they 've both eluded me riding hard to the northeast . "
tr	3	" Thank you all for coming on such short notice , " she starts , waiting for the chatter to die down .
tr	2	" I told you that old sword the king gave you wouldn 't hold up in a real fight . "
tr	0	In a heartbeat , Link has produced his bow with an arrow drawn tightly back , aiming directly at the owl 's chest .
tr	4	Seemingly shocked and appalled , the bird rapidly beats its wings , propelling itself up and out of the area in moments .
tr	4	The hook lands just above the snickering adolescent , and Link soars across the green landscape to claim his property .
tr	3	Bursting from the canopy , the skull kid thrusts a mighty punch , hitting the large , kite shield dead in the center .
tr	1	The mostly yellow and decaying landscape has grown distinctly more lavish and green , both around the canopy and along the ground .
tr	1	Not wanting to play the ocarina until he knows just how close Link is , he holds it near his lips , squinting downward .
tr	1	Even so , the impact sends Link flying backward , tumbling to a graceless stop as he finds his footing .
tr	0	Just as he 'd hoped , Link raises his shield to block , unaware just how hard the kid intends to hit him .
tr	1	Staring down for a moment longer , Link sighs as if he feels sorry for the punk who made this simple task so difficult .
tr	0	Enough to put a smile on Link 's face any other day , but he has scarcely heard a single word Navi has said .
tr	4	A thirst for blood resonates in the very air he breathes as he can practically feel Garo 's essence drift through him in anticipation .
tr	1	Trekking into his second temple , Rift cannot help but feel anxious , his last adventure nearly killing him on more than one occasion .
tr	1	Continuing down the seemingly endless path , Rift suspiciously scouts overhead , the dark canyon void of any illuminating crystals .
tr	0	" Yeah , this is a little too easy for my taste , " Mai agrees as the boy cautiously approaches .
tr	2	Now studying his surroundings more thoroughly Rift spots a camouflaged doorway positioned much higher than the pillar along the wall of the large dome .
tr	2	Without warning , the floor below the boy turns transparent as if it 's become a glowing window to another dimension .
tr	2	Glancing to his left only serves to further confuse him , the doorway overlooking the large room filling his vision .
tr	1	It 's sort of like teleporting in a way , " she admits , uncertain if her comparisons are helping .
tr	3	Finding his feet once again , Rift attempts to study his adversary 's movements as they close in for another attack .
tr	3	" They 're faster than they let on , " Mai must admit , not expecting such a well-coordinated attack .
tr	3	Opting to attack in unison instead of succession , both water forms dash outward before converging with their arms extended in spin attacks .
tr	4	Thrown into a panic , the foes quickly realize they must retreat , their barrage unable to disable the boy even temporarily .
tr	1	" Well played , " Mai smugly admits , genuinely impressed by his growing ability to think on his feet .
tr	3	Dropping through another portal he cuts off his fleeing foe , though he doesn 't attempt to attack just yet .
tr	3	As cautiously as he 's able , Rift steps toward the switch , inadvertently activating yet another glyph upon the floor .
tr	2	Continuing forward , he steps on one of the two buttons , the shape popping into the ground with a loud locking noise .
tr	1	Almost ready to give up , his shoulders go limp as he closes his eyes to let out an agitated sigh .
tr	3	" I forgot to mention before , " Mai starts , realizing why Rift hasn 't figured out the simple puzzle just yet .
tr	1	Locking onto the spot where he is aiming , Mai doesn 't create the dimensional window just yet , waiting for his confirmation .
tr	3	" That 's why we 're a team , " Mai promptly asserts as the boy shoves the block onto the remaining switch .
tr	2	The room continues to ebb and flow , several spots forming whirlpools as the liquid rapidly drains up through the ceiling .
tr	4	Not expecting her to be staring at him , the boy immediately breaks eye contact out of a simple sort of reflex .
tr	0	Landing back at square one , he squints down the long hallway , not at all looking forward to the potential hardships before him .
tr	2	His baggy , black pants now loosely hang about his thighs before tightly conforming to his leg below the knee inside the boots .
tr	1	Rift asks , feeling significantly tougher in his new armor , but still mildly worried what threat this new challenger poses .
tr	0	Waiting to see which side his antagonist appears on , he is far from prepared when Mai shouts a warning .
tr	1	His left hand hangs open just beneath his chin , and he never for an instant pauses in his relentless push forward .
tr	1	Resuming his stance , he remains still , carefully watching his opponent 's sword hand as it playfully twirls the blade during his approach .
tr	2	A cold chill quakes down Rift 's spine , but Mai 's comforting touch seems to warm his body from the inside out .
tr	2	Too shocked to offer a physical response , the boy stands frozen in place until a dark boot connects with his chin .
tr	3	Without an instant to lose , Rift thrusts his hand at nothing in particular while calling for Mai 's assistance .
tr	4	Another crystal of light is destroyed , the falling debris steadily increasing in volume as the empty battleground becomes clustered with obliterated stone .
tr	1	Crossing his arms in his signature X fashion , Rift scissors them apart just as he descends upon the shadow 's back .
tr	4	As the light source is destroyed , so too are the boy 's seconds of celebration as the collapse of the temple increases dramatically .
tr	0	The path ahead narrows in the frantic rainfall , the walls dropping chunks of earth and stone constantly in a catastrophic display .
tr	0	A gargantuan chasm opens like a hungry mouth of darkness as the boy falls alongside a random glowing stone of brilliant yellow .
tr	2	Mai offers , snatching him from the jaws of oblivion as the light continues to fall and fall further below .
tr	3	Thrown upward , Rift palms a pillar of stalagmite as it tilts into the ravine , pushing off to maintain his ascent .
tr	0	Still shaking with fear he leaps as far forward as he can , plunging into the water with incalculable angst .
tr	1	Already beginning to slow in his descent , Mai 's firm grasp jerks him forward , soaring toward the exit with purpose .
tr	4	Desperation takes hold of his heart , but even so , he feels a more important urge to fight for her .
tr	1	The patch of yellow fills his vision as he finally succumbs to his burning lungs , exhaling violently as his senses grow fuzzy .
tr	1	Attacking simultaneously , one of the pair is immediately immobilized by a subtle flick of the dark lord 's wrist .
tr	4	Failing to notice his partner 's imprisonment , the second guard rolls into a ball , rocketing toward the intruder like a deadly boulder .
tr	1	Turning to face him slowly , Ganondorf 's face has changed in the seconds since he last looked upon him .
tr	3	Not yet discouraged , Link throws a quick one-two punch , but the dark lord catches each of his fists in turn .
tr	0	Shaking his head to clear his thoughts , the king of thieves glares at Link , now unwrapping his hands ceremonially .
tr	1	Death Mountain explodes high above them , more and more lava pouring down the mountainside and illuminating the dark night .
tr	4	Moving so close did not grant him the unstoppable power he expected , and this realization has pushed him away .
tr	1	Abandoning his thirst for power , Ganondorf returns to his cunning roots , anchoring Link 's arm with a magic chain from behind .
tr	1	Circling around the stationary Link , Ganondorf summons glyph after glyph , sprinting across the temporary bridge until he is back on solid ground .
tr	1	The occasional quiver shakes his right hand as the dark lord is obviously still in pain from Link 's earlier attack .
tr	3	His attack nearly ready for deployment , Ganondorf knows he cannot miss if he hopes to end this fight without taking further damage .
tr	3	Lying at the king of thieves ' feet , a ghostly form awaits its execution , making no futile attempt to flee .
tr	4	Exploding long before clearing the walls , the projectiles hit strategically summoned barriers as the Queen is determined to protect her town .
tr	1	Sliding a hand behind her back , the Queen summons a fireball as her blonde antagonist shows no signs of weakness or arrogance .
tr	4	Inside the city gates , a sad collection of soldiers have gathered along with Zelda 's disciples , preparing themselves for the coming battle .
tr	4	Another flurry of shuriken spins and slashes past Zelda , her evasive maneuvers doing just enough to keep her alive .
tr	4	The explosion sends shrapnel in every direction except the space beyond the shield , the ice absorbing the blow while retaining its shape .
tr	4	The tattered Queen would love nothing more than to enjoy the brief moment of victory , but something urges her forward .
tr	3	Back at the city gates , an unexpected torrent of reinforcements blast up and out of the sad remains of the town 's moat .
tr	1	The torrential vacuum finally shrinks to nothing , a brief blip of light sealing it once more and returning the shop to normal .
tr	4	The battle concluded , Zelda dashes for the gate to determine the outcome of the larger war being waged for the town itself .
tr	4	A few of the citizens remain crouched inside their doorways , afraid to make the run for the castle amidst all the chaos .
tr	0	Finally backing away with an embarrassed smile , Zelda scoops her wild hair off her face and behind her pointy ears with a sigh .
tr	0	A raised eyebrow accompanied by a quick look up and down is met with a chuckle as Link 's concern is understandable .
tr	1	Ocarina in hand , Link is already playing Epona 's song as he runs , his trusty horse galloping toward him in seconds .
tr	1	Forged in the foundries of the castle , it is identical to his previous sword in function , but thoroughly eclipses the quality .
tr	4	The dim , green eyes beneath the dark , brown hood watch the hero 's every movement , never straying , and never blinking .
tr	1	Leaping into the air , Garo dives upon Link in a crescent , his unnatural movement seeming to defy common laws of physics .
tr	4	The force from the blow throws Link back a step , the brief whirlwind visibly affecting the grass beneath his assailant 's feet .
tr	2	Scrambling back a few steps , Link only now notices his blade is devoid of blood , though his counterattack struck true .
tr	1	Slowly turning to face him , the ninja begins walking toward the hero , his swords dangling at his sides in a signature fashion .
tr	4	She asks , only glancing at him for a moment before returning her eyes to the angry enemy before them .
tr	2	Quickly growing overconfident , Garo lets a swing linger a second too long , his chest vulnerable for only a moment .
tr	4	Not expecting the discharge to be quite so potent , Garo is thrown into the darkness of Hyrule Field with a deep grunt .
tr	1	Immediately dashing to Link 's side , Zelda finds him weary , but far from finished as he climbs back to his feet .
tr	2	Treading on shadows , Garo moves without sound or essence , intending to deal the final blow to his prey .
tr	4	Appearing like a tumbling wave of dominoes , more ethereal mirrors spawn in rapid succession , reflecting and amplifying the meager amount of light .
tr	2	Holding his empty bottle outward , Link sees he is gesturing for Garo to enter the soul trap of his own accord .
tr	0	" I know who you are , " Garo reveals , standing tall and ceasing his approach for the moment .
tr	2	" You would mock me as your people mocked the Gods , " the ninja points out , growing almost cavalier .
tr	4	The last line stabs Geist somewhere deep beyond his flesh , his expression twitching in a momentary submission to anger .
tr	4	The second they 've reached the optimum positioning , Geist closes his fist , prompting them to mash together like a three dimensional guillotine .
tr	3	Slamming the shell shut at the last moment , the ninja 's swords are caught in a bear trap of sorts .
tr	1	Caught off guard , Geist stumbles back a step as the assassin seems to teleport behind him whirling into a vicious string of attacks .
tr	1	Inadvertently dropping his swords , Garo is pulled into the air by the crushing handcuffs , quickly thrashing himself free from their confines .
tr	1	Quickly grabbing an empty bottle from his coat and summoning another sphere to his palm , Geist prepares to finish him .
tr	1	Quickly cutting him off , Link holds up a hand before crouching down to listen to the ninja 's final words .
tr	1	Soaring downward , he trails the boy by a negligible margin , winding up to smash him into the ground the instant he lands .
tr	3	Falling through the portrait , Rift vanishes completely as Link hits the spot where the portal rested only a moment ago .
tr	1	A loud thunderclap sounds overhead , and Link tilts her mess of hair onto his shoulder as it starts to rain .
tr	1	The only thing still binding him to this world is regret , and with every admission , the phantom fades imperceptibly .
tr	1	Standing in a stunned stupor from the torrent of information , Link fails to hear the voices calling his name .
tr	0	Now , on the dark trail leading up the mountain , she hovers just above him with her hands on his chest .
tr	4	The sizzling steadily amplifies and he realizes the volcano has erupted recently , the hardened lava ground having yet to cool completely .
tr	0	Rolling into a ball he bashes against the mountainside , knocking several large rocks loose above in an avalanche of falling stone .
tr	1	A daunting display of ability Rift has no intention of seeing up close , the punches and elbow strikes are horrifyingly destructive .
tr	1	The room ceases spinning as quickly as it started , and with a stumbling misstep , Rift has regained his balance .
tr	2	Searching his surroundings for a moment longer , the boy finally spots a peculiar shade of bleached stone upon a cone-shaped wall of rock .
tr	1	The ground he stands upon sizzles at such a high pitch , the noise soon fades into Rift 's subconscious .
tr	3	" Call me crazy , but I 'd rather not get too close to those things , " he admits with a nervous sigh .
tr	4	As long as you don 't touch them we should be fine , " she concludes as if the feat is no big deal .
tr	3	Far in the distance , a tidal wave of white lava spews from the ground , rapidly closing the distance to the battleground .
tr	3	The approaching villain twirls its axe in one hand , demonstrating its absurd strength while it faintly growls between steps .
tr	4	The warrior executes another deadly swing , but the boy rolls over the top of the slow-moving slice of metal .
tr	4	At Mai 's command , he quickly sidesteps the following overhead strike , finding himself in an extremely advantageous position .
tr	1	Rolling to the side , Rift narrowly manages to avoid the strike , finding himself with the strategic upper hand once again .
tr	0	Another painful roar sounds , and another plate is shoved aside as Mai waits for the boy to finish the fight .
tr	4	You were all , I 've heard this before , " she recalls , using her best impression of the boy .
tr	1	Slowly willing himself to grow accustomed to her physical antics , Rift still finds himself staring in a thoughtless stupor every time she appears .
tr	4	" Eyes up here , " she demands , pointing at her face before smiling wryly and turning her attention back to the task .
tr	3	" Let 's try that one on the left , " he decides , walking closer , but allowing Mai to test it first .
tr	1	His spirit rejuvenated for the time being , Rift jogs down the hall , turning right and immediately hitting a dead end .
tr	1	Another eruption of lava would be the end for Rift , the underground maze 's only exits an unknown distance away .
tr	1	Continuing down the new direction , several more dead ends are found as Mai continues to map out the growing labyrinth .
tr	0	He asks , waiting a moment before adding , " and don 't say I have , " he starts .
tr	1	" I 'm glad I met you , Rift , " she admits , her tone suddenly turning mildly lethargic .
tr	4	With that she fades away , the grin on the boy 's face certain to remain for quite a while .
tr	3	" We don 't have a ton of time , so , " she starts , hating to ruin the moment .
tr	1	Rolling to a sitting position , Rift glances at his hands to see the putrid , purple muck slowly dripping off .
tr	1	Utilizing Rift 's body like a hammer , Mai slams him downward , his fist hitting the blob with incredible force .
tr	2	A single ripple quakes through the monstrosity 's body before it collapses onto the ground with the boy on top of it .
tr	4	Gradually turning to liquid itself , the deteriorating flesh reveals the lost grieves , slowly seeping through the muck and muscle .
tr	3	Delighted to have them back , Rift straps the boots back on hurriedly , and returns to his quest a bit more cautiously .
tr	1	The muck coating his body has quickly dried , but remains incredibly unpleasant , causing his limbs to stick to his grotesque clothing .
tr	1	Stepping closer she reaches past his ears , smiling shyly as she pulls his hood over his head for him .
tr	4	Desperate to close the distance , he dashes forward , dumbstruck when he flashes through the long hallway in an instant .
tr	4	The final checkpoint has nearly reached the ceiling as the boy dashes forward like a bolt of lightning to close the distance .
tr	3	Failing to see the coming swarm until the last second , the boy sees Mai 's strategy too late to opt out .
tr	2	Though far from dependable , the mass of mammals provide sturdy enough footing to allow the boy to advance forward .
tr	4	" You really helped me out , though , " Rift admits , sounding especially sincere despite the unintentional insult .
tr	0	" Men make war and sorrow , " the patriarch sighs , reflecting on his past as well as the coming days .
tr	2	Ignoring the ominous blonde , Ganondorf continues forward , his monstrous visage scaring the majority of the inhabitants back into their homes .
tr	1	Standing with her hands on her hips , her unimpressed expression seems to ask what the intruder could possibly want .
tr	4	Though the rain bears down on him relentlessly , his golden gauntlets still seem to glimmer in the sparse light .
tr	4	Without the blade of evil 's bane , the confident hero will certainly fall to the overwhelming power of Din 's essence .
tr	4	A puff of her breath encircles his neck like a collar of passion , and the long sought embrace has finally occurred .
tr	4	Not bothering to attempt to free his blade , Link stares at the Goddess in horror as she idly pushes the blade aside .
tr	3	Now trapped in a spider web of heavy , conjured iron , Link vainly attempts to free himself from the tightly constricting restraints .
tr	4	Stopping in front of the paralyzed hero , he reaches back , making certain he obtains enough power to obliterate him completely .
tr	3	The most horrible sensation throbs from his wound and it is enough to cut his visit to the forest short .
tr	4	Without a second thought , he storms out of the area , throwing fallen trees and debris aside as he runs .
tr	4	The casualties were equally low , but in her eyes , a single soul lost is no better than a thousand .
tr	1	The dark , grey clouds quickly tumble overhead , drifting into the mountainous north with a fierce wind howling high above .
tr	1	" I 'd be lying if I turned you down , " she admits , shedding all manner of formality .
tr	4	" Grab that end , " she points out , crouching beside a heavy dresser she had been avoiding until someone returned to help .
tr	3	" That 's understandable , " Zelda sighs , thinking of how desperate her citizens must be getting at this point .
tr	3	" Thanks , " he starts , trailing off as he fails to come up with anything else to say .
tr	4	After a time of silence , the tedious task clearing the young boy 's mind as well , the conversation resumes .
tr	3	He just thought it should be a knight standing there instead , " he expresses , beginning to think he is insinuating too much .
tr	4	Acts he always knew he would be capable of until his mettle was tested in the most extreme of scenarios .
tr	2	The colossal ring of flame has accelerated its pace , but now pales in comparison to the dark void consuming the kingdom .
tr	4	The dark figure 's features remain a mystery , but its hand remains extended to her , almost pleading she accept its uncertain proposal .
tr	3	" We won 't worry about transporting the raw materials until the rest is sorted and we have an idea of inventory .
tr	3	Each of the guards bow until she has started up the hill , the moist ground making the climb more difficult than usual .
tr	1	She is not simply another grandiose royal , always remaining in the castle and turning her nose up at the commoners .
tr	0	" Any food and building material your kingdom can spare will be much appreciated as we have suffered an attack of our own . "
tr	4	Descending back into the room , Zelda is happily received , one elderly woman even stepping forward to give her a weak hug .
tr	4	" One more thing , " the scout interrupts , obviously unsure if he should reveal the final piece of information .
tr	4	We must find the remaining shards of the Master Sword , " she informs , trying desperately to get some kind of response .
tr	0	The trek through the Lost Woods passes him by without a hitch , his subconscious guiding him through the path traveled a hundred times .
tr	1	" It was my fault , " he mumbles , keeping his chin to his chest as he rocks himself slightly .
tr	1	Instantly raising a silencing hand , Link kneels next to the kid , placing a comforting hand on his shoulder .
tr	2	" When you returned the Master Sword all those years ago , I was happy you could live out your childhood .
tr	1	A minimalistic green tunic clings to her pale skin , falling into a short skirt high above her bare feet .
tr	1	You will not fail , " she insists , taking a step closer as she reads his soul like a book .
tr	4	" I 'm sorry , " she gasps , floating erratically , yet relieved she didn 't go too far .
tr	0	" I don 't recall this one , though , " he smiles , rubbing his chin as he stares at the fairy .
tr	4	I go wherever happiness is needed , " he nods , rubbing his hands together in what is becoming an obsessive manner .
tr	1	Though he couldn 't see it when he was young , Link senses something bizarre and unnatural about the man 's antics .
tr	2	" If you would be so kind as to accept a mask , I would feel as though my debt to you is fulfilled .
tr	0	It would make me very happy , and I suspect I have something amongst my wares that would make you happy as well . "
tr	4	Too many have died already , and many more are sure to follow if things continue as they 've been .
tr	1	" I don 't like that one , Link , " the skull kid admits , shaking his head beneath his new mask .
tr	4	" This won 't protect you from her , " Navi sighs , seeming to speak another language when talking to the salesman .
tr	1	The evening sun has already begun its plunge into the horizon , and night will be upon him soon enough .
tr	4	She responds , appearing atop the boy 's shoulders once again , leaning forward to study his face beneath his new hood .
tr	1	Reclining in a rocking chair , the middle-aged man taps his thumb upon his shovel , speared into the ground next to him .
tr	3	" I 'll take my chances , " the boy shrugs , spotting the wooden object lying next to the man 's chair .
tr	4	Walking atop the damp cobblestones , the boy sees several graves have been unearthed recently , their tombstones still blank .
tr	0	A small cavern leads left , and after descending a gradual decline , the boy discovers a large , circular room ravaged by time .
tr	0	A massive glyph containing an array of strange symbols encompasses the floor , gradually fading as it stretches from the center of the room .
tr	1	Quickly finding it difficult to maneuver with his hand pressed against his face , the boy lowers his arm for the moment .
tr	1	Permanently pulled into the visible spectrum , the building continues to glow faintly , serving to slightly illuminate his surroundings .
tr	1	Rift responds , pulling his hood over his head and reaching into his tunic to grasp his precious music box .
tr	4	Three of the routes emerging from the central point lead downward at an angle , while three more ascend up toward the ceiling .
tr	1	Another portal is utilized and in seconds he is pulling open the door and strolling into the building filled with worry .
tr	3	" Greetings , young man , " the figure proclaims , sitting atop the chest with his back strait and arms crossed .
tr	0	Clearly some sort of scout during his life , the man wears a tightly fitting jumpsuit and a long bandana tied around his forehead .
tr	4	" I am a genius , " she points out , emphasizing the second word as her ego grows even larger .
tr	1	Trying to focus his thoughts on fonder memories , he clutches his music box and races through the room as quickly as possible .
tr	3	" You 've come to attempt my test I assume , " she states more than asks , waiting impatiently for a response .
tr	1	Letting his frustrations slip away , Rift decides having Mai with him is more important than being smart enough to solve these stupid riddles .
tr	1	" I need to ask something , " she starts , moving closer as Rift steps away from the door .
tr	1	It is not rage , or joy , or sorrow , but an immense urge pushing her into an imminent action .
tr	0	Rift asks with a smile , his hand already wrapped around the door knob as he turns to look back .
tr	3	With one hand clasped in the other , he stares at the floor , making no attempt to greet the boy .
tr	1	With nothing but a sigh in response , the ghost looks to his left , and fades away where he sits .
tr	4	After teleporting back and taking Mai 's hand , the boy smiles gleefully at his companion , overwhelmed with joy for some reason .
tr	4	Not bothering to even attempt to make sense of the gibberish , the boy waits for Mai to deliver the obvious answer .
tr	4	Above , the room he was previously standing in has been destroyed , any chance of escape via portal now impossible .
tr	3	" Alright , Rift , " Mai starts , appearing next to the boy to be certain she has his attention .
tr	0	Gradually approaching , like an old woman searching for a light switch , the monster paws at the open air blindly .
tr	2	A fleshy hand weakly clasps onto the boy 's gauntlet , the zombie slowly pulling itself toward the boy 's vulnerable throat .
tr	1	Just calm down , " she explains , dragging out the last two words as she presses her forehead to his .
tr	0	Setting a casual pace back to the central room , Rift regains his composure as Mai materializes to guide him through the area .
tr	1	It 's with hands but not clocks , I make cords but not ropes , " she says with a mischievous smile .
tr	1	Praying Mai has the answer this time around , the boy turns his back to the ghost , closes his eyes , and waits .
tr	1	" I don 't know , Rift , " she starts , felling awful when his shoulders slouch in defeat .
tr	0	Immediately exiting the room and summoning a portal back across the vast chasm , he feels a strange sensation resonating from his right hand .
tr	3	Only three steps onto the platform leading through the open archway to the next room , the floor cracks apart and Mai falls through .
tr	3	Without hesitation , he leaps into the air , taking Mai 's hand and swinging the short distance into the next area .
tr	4	The center of the chamber holds exactly what the duo were hoping for , a large treasure chest standing alone .
tr	2	Gradually coming into view , a horrendous monster dragging an object behind it slows to a stop near the center of the platform .
tr	3	Quickly circling away from the monstrosity , the boy considers how he should attack , carefully sticking to the edges of the platform .
tr	3	The mummy 's erratic , twitching movements fill the boy 's vision as it slowly turns to face its prey .
tr	1	The vibrating wire behind him slowly returns to its stationary position , the irritating sound fading away as the boy climbs off the ground .
tr	2	Mai demands , appearing just long enough to scoop the boy off the ground and shove him toward the door .
tr	2	Sprinting forward , he throws the door open to find the sound is outside as well , though not nearly as loud .
tr	4	Landing upon the central pedestal amongst the sea of unlit torches , the boy expels a well-earned sigh of relief .
tr	1	Without warning , an explosion of flame ignites all of the torches simultaneously , illuminating the entire cave with orange light .
tr	1	The sun is setting , and he will not waste another moment licking his wounds so long as sages yet live .
tr	3	" I 've more pressing matters to attend to , " he grumbles , marching into the throne room without looking back .
tr	4	His Goddess provides everything he will ever need , and soon he will rule over all with her at his side .
tr	1	Instantly stepping into pace , a pair of guards follow Ganondorf down the endless flights of stairs , finally reaching the prison block .
tr	3	Still reclining against the wall , Ganondorf makes no attempt to approach the scout , eyeing him thoughtfully as he endures the lasting pain .
tr	2	" Perhaps you need a moment to consider your position , " he shrugs , rising off the wall and exiting the room .
tr	1	With a sadistic snicker , the masked woman struts out of the shadows , coiling her instrument in her hand as she exits .
tr	3	Making his way through the darkness , he stealthily arrives at his destination , peering through a thin drainage grate of the torture room .
tr	3	" Keep quiet , " she promptly retorts , pulling on his arms to situate him comfortably on her back .
tr	1	Bursting into his chambers , he immediately begins to strap on his armor , not noticing the pair of women seated on his bed .
tr	1	" If she voices protest , dispose of her as well , " he instructs as the donning of his armor is complete .
tr	2	All thoughts of heirs and relationships are nowhere to be found , his feral mind focusing in on only one goal .
tr	4	" The castle stands defenseless , and yet you failed to take it with an army at your heels ! "
tr	1	" My sister knew the cost of failure , as do I , " she starts as her emotions seep into her words .
tr	4	If any but I approach , kill them , " he orders , staring into her eyes a moment longer before departing .
tr	4	The base of the river , almost completely dry a short time ago , has regained a healthy flow due to the recent rain .
tr	0	Leaping into the air , he summons a glyph at his feet , launching him across the moat , and into the barrier .
tr	3	The two guards positioned on each side of the entrance climb back to their feet , thoroughly rattled by the sudden attack .
tr	0	Resuming his march toward the church , he hears the guard land in the moat behind him with a loud splash .
tr	4	The exceptionally old priest hobbles into view , palming nearby objects for balance as he seeks to ascertain the meaning of the commotion .
tr	1	A gradual sigh tumbles from the old man 's lips as he sees his disguise has worn out its use .
tr	1	Realizing his opportunity , the old man grunts briefly , slapping his wrists together with his palms facing the warlock .
tr	1	Licking her lips in anticipation , Din squeezes her chosen 's form against hers within her protective orb of flame .
tr	4	An endless rain of wreckage tumbles down all around him , the moon shining down upon the newly formed crater with a silvery hue .
tr	3	Suddenly unable to focus on any other thought , the dark lord grips the golden trinket tightly as he marches back into the town .
tr	3	He has attempted to simply walk away , but if it is a fight she wants , he will certainly oblige .
tr	1	Quickly dashing to the center of the torches , Rift carefully scans his surroundings , waiting for the assassin to make her move .
tr	1	His options quickly dwindling , Rift must fight off the urge to panic as the available light shrinks smaller and smaller .
tr	1	A brief grunt of pain is all Rift can offer , the wind knocked from his lungs in the sudden assault .
tr	1	The direct physical interaction jars the ninja with an overwhelming influx of information , causing her to stumble to the side .
tr	4	You care for her deeply , but when the time comes , she will discard you like a piece of trash . "
tr	1	Utilizing his own momentum once again , she forces her weight backward , resulting in the both of them twirling in a circle .
tr	2	" I do know you , " Sheik assures , continuing to appeal to what is left of his contaminated soul .
tr	4	" A stirring speech , " the ninja immediately retorts , eager to offer a counter argument to Rift 's captivated ears .
tr	3	" Though he can 't understand it just yet , " she sighs , taking his right hand and lifting it toward his eyes .
tr	4	Behind her back , Mai initiates a three count as the boy fails to understand the depth of her plan .
tr	4	A terrified step backward causes Rift to collide with the smooth stone behind him , and suddenly , he understands .
tr	0	Seconds later , the devastating storm subsides , and Zelda tumbles downward , falling and falling until finally landing upon a patch of grass .
tr	4	The only thing that matters now is Zelda 's safety , and should he find her harmed , he will never forgive himself .
tr	4	Charging between decimated homes , Link makes his way past the steady trickle of tumbling pebbles and into the graveyard .
tr	4	Ascending past the destroyed slab of rock at the entrance , Link glances left to discover exactly what he had hoped not to .
tr	4	Touching a hand to her cheek and leaning in close , he finds his misplaced determination when he hears her faint breathing .
tr	4	An eccentric , young servant asks , attempting to keep pace with the human gurney whisking the Queen to the comfort of her bed .
tr	4	" You 've really done it this time , " she sighs , scolding the unconscious woman while keeping a tone of genuine compassion .
tr	1	Turning to face him in no particular hurry , Link doesn 't so much as blink as the young man steps into his face .
tr	2	A demoralizing gaze , not of hatred , but of cold necessity locks onto the younger swordsman as he too reaches for his blade .
tr	3	A sort of game played to see who will be the first to back down from the rapidly escalating situation .
tr	3	The guard 's pathetic attempts to shoo Epona back outside fail as she turns to greet Link , knocking one of them over .
tr	2	With no time to lose , Link spurs his horse forward , sprinting for the entrance of the colossal prison .
tr	0	Taking a second to lament , he hears a distant whoosh of air , like a whip swinging through a gust of wind .
tr	1	A diagonal swing is dodged , and the following kick is batted aside as the hero plans out his optimal time to counter .
tr	4	With a faint degree of remorse for the misguided thief , Link leaves her where she lies just the same .
tr	4	Though the king of thieves would see this trait as weakness to be exploited , Mai observes it as a sort of unaltered purity .
tr	2	" I 'll handle this , " Less declares , pulling a weighted kunai from the small of her back .
tr	0	" Trust me , " the boy assures , scooping an arm around her waist and leaping toward the wall .
tr	3	High atop the crumbling walls of the structure , the entire desert is visible through the blanket of black cascading outward from the grounds .
tr	4	They seem to communicate through inexplicable noises and gestures as they form a perimeter around the prison and prepare to move out across Hyrule .
tr	3	The southeastern portion of the massive room grows noticeably brighter , the mystical , pink sand doubling its flow from that direction .
tr	1	Mai exclaims , taking form and hugging him as she kicks a single leg up behind her in a girly cliché of affection .
tr	4	Reaching the lever , he gives it a hard pull , the result being the very same loud click as before .
tr	3	Seconds later , the torrent subsides , and Rift is left lying on his back , staring up at what was once the ground .
tr	1	" This is ridiculous , " he decides , shaking his head and failing to summon the will to move just yet .
tr	1	Formerly submerged architecture now drains slowly , the buildings and walkways hemorrhaging sand now that gravity has returned to normal .
tr	4	" Cut it out , " he chuckles , shoving her to the side playfully and stepping up to the challenge .
tr	1	In a brief blast he plows through the thin veil concealing the room , landing harshly amongst the bouncing grains .
tr	3	Finally reaching the base of the growing pyramid , he is confused to find nothing of interest at the bottom .
tr	1	Thinking back to his initial visit to this room , he recalls the forms hanging from the ceiling he couldn 't quite make out .
tr	3	" You wonder why I don 't want to talk to you anymore , " she mutters after landing safely this time around .
tr	3	" Alright , this is it , " Mai starts , attempting to get her companion psyched up for the coming ordeal .
tr	3	" As soon as it starts to turn we 've got to get to the bottom before the sand does . "
tr	0	The absurd amount of sand lands harshly in their wake , and the Goddess vanishes while Rift falls into the mammoth , dark room .
tr	0	The dry air whips against his face as he peers through the dark room in search of another flat surface .
tr	4	The sand continues to build up , and it becomes obvious he will be buried alive in a very short period of time .
tr	1	Navi 's insistence to act less hastily falls upon deaf ears as the hero rushes forward , throwing all other matters to the wind .
tr	4	Dozens of the shady assassins appear from every shadow and crevice overhead , each meticulously lining up an arrow with the fearless hero .
tr	1	Quickly snatching his shield from his back , Link deflects several more arrows as he is nearly out of harm 's way .
tr	0	Unable to bat away so many arrows fired at once , Link jerks on the reigns to duck down a side alley .
tr	1	The sword-wielding women guarding the path show no signs of backing down , aggressively advancing forward as the horse bears down on them .
tr	0	Failing to hear her at all , the hero continues to rock slowly with his horse 's limp head in his arms .
tr	4	Endlessly entertained by her struggle , Ganondorf sips his wine once again , waiting for the inevitable battle to ensue .
tr	1	Mimicking Link 's signature style as best they can , they dash inward , one of them slicing high while the other swings low .
tr	1	Ducking and turning in a sudden motion , Link blocks the low strike with his forearm while the dark warrior 's cuts overhead .
tr	3	Sent skipping and tumbling to the room 's perimeter , the copycat 's sword is inadvertently thrown at the moment of impact .
tr	1	The chains snap apart like interlinked paper clips , the dark lord 's initial offensive hardly slowing his opponent down .
tr	1	Shaking off the pain , Link climbs to his feet to find the dark lord back on the ground , already summoning another one .
tr	1	Slipping in his grasp , the sharp metal eats into his gauntlets as the tip jumps even closer to his angry grimace .
tr	1	Raising her palms , the Goddess lifts both Link 's sword and shield from his grasp , imbuing them with her power .
tr	1	Rolling forward as Ganon attempts a horizontal swing , Link finds an opening , slashing at his enemy 's exposed leg .
tr	3	Another stab to the thigh prompts the demon to swing his sword blindly , unable to turn and face his assailant .
tr	4	Baffled by the demon 's decision to remain where he stands , the hero realizes his intentions far too late .
tr	1	Slowly raising his upturned palms , the beast grins crazily as his blood slowly rises off the ground and into the air .
tr	1	Even the liquid pouring from his wounds begins to ignore gravity , swirling around his form in droplets and long streams .
tr	0	The arrow screams across the room , a trail of vibrant light radiating in its wake as it reaches for the demon 's soul .
tr	4	The final portal to the sacred realm slowly closes , and for the briefest moment , the room falls silent .
tr	3	Ganon 's blade stabs through the boy with no resistance , but unfortunately , it also stabs through the ground with no resistance .
tr	1	A twitch of irritation clouds Rift 's expression for only a moment before he initiates a rapid combination , landing several successive kicks .
tr	3	As Rift debates the fastest way to put her down , Zelda finally has her chance to attempt to reach him .
tr	4	Unsure what the boy 's motives are , or what Zelda is shouting about , Midna decides enough is enough .
tr	3	The vacuum of light is too much for Midna to resist , while the dark portal immediately lays claim to Zelda .
tr	3	The chunk of stone smashes into the wall with a dreadful crunch , but unfortunately , it hits without Rift behind it .
tr	4	Finally locating the boy , Link begins to charge but quickly reconsiders when he sees Mai awaiting her chosen 's embrace .
tr	3	Two of the distorted forms circle around to attack from the sides while the third leaps into the air to descend upon him .
tr	2	You feared you wouldn 't be able to protect the ones you love , though you would never admit it .
tr	3	Now that they are lost to you , tell me , is there anything left in this world to fear ? "
tr	2	" I thought so , " she grins , idly tossing him back to the center of the room like a ragdoll .
tr	4	Over and over again she plummets , quickly becoming a ghostly blur until a window of light opens directly above the grounded hero .
tr	1	His father 's words a distant memory , Link 's suffering presses down upon him like a thousand chains of consequence and duty .
tr	0	Primarily black , the misshapen blade has traces of gold along with several swirling specks of light , spinning and weaving about the weapon .
tr	4	The moonlight shining down across all of Hyrule is blinked out of existence for the lasting moment the eruption of black requires to subside .
tr	1	The only remaining article of clothing upon him is what remains of his pants , ripped apart by the transformation process .
tr	0	A leaping stab in the form of a superman punch grazes Rift 's armor as the absurdly quick attack catches Mai off guard .
tr	2	Giving him no time to recover , Mai combos into a devastating elbow to the temple before dropping back to the ground .
tr	1	Grinning with satisfaction , Mai is briefly confused when she spots a falling piece of debris , frozen in time by unknown forces .
tr	1	Turning back to her opponent , Mai is surprised to see the golden glow within him not only returning , but growing exponentially brighter .
tr	4	Her chosen was a magnifying lens through which she hoped to better understand the aspirations of both good and evil creatures .
tr	4	He could not be better armed if he had he shopped a Somali Warlord 's garage sale with Ted Nugent 's credit card .
tr	3	He took out his own Blueberry and began to type on it with one thumb , wagging his sign with the other hand .
tr	2	" I thought you said those gizmos couldn 't come outta somebody 's sphinx unless they had vinegar corporations ? "
tr	0	" So that Christmas stays in our corner and Senor Ramadan and the Kwanzaa Elephant don 't get the gig . "
tr	4	" No , " said the Cursed Hand , pouting like a sixteen-year-old girl whose car keys have been taken away .
tr	2	Why , one look at your present and she 'll know you 're a -- " " SON OF A BITCH ! "
tr	4	Duke knew that look ; he had been a teenager once , and that was the look of somebody about to do mischief .
tr	4	A torrent of money gushed from his mouth as he fell to his hands and knees , retching his previously eaten wealth .
tr	4	As he endured the chill resulting from his robe hanging open , his chest heaved with great , wracking sobs .
tr	2	His only act of forethought and consideration had been to remove and throw away the extensive cache of pornography he kept in his room .
tr	4	The box of broken cellphones erroneously sent to Chip Harris ' home address only mocked Chip 's failed tenure with the company .
tr	4	The Avenger had been careful to cover his tracks , including never , EVER using the Internet to arrange his ... adoptions .
tr	3	* * * In a decrepit hideout in the waterfront district , the criminal known as the RPG bandit unwrapped a Christmas present .
tr	1	* * * In his secret lair , the Cursed Hand , also known as Redmond W. Terwilliger , stared down in mounting horror .
tr	4	His sister never reacted to Billy 's cruelty because she knew , deep down , that he had no desire to hurt her .
tr	4	When an emergency extraction team of elves had dragged the fat man unconscious from the living room , Billy thought it was all over .
tr	2	" Two , I 'm out of coal , so I 'm going to fill your stocking with tears . "
tr	4	* * * In all recorded human history , there are exactly three spankings considered sufficiently noteworthy to commit to the annals of mankind .
tr	1	You don 't pull a sleigh around the world in one night and not kill a reindeer now and then . "
tr	0	By ' lay off , ' I mean ' shoot in the face and bury in a mass grave . '
tr	1	" Something about a man on fire running through her mother 's yard and setting the doghouse on fire , " said Claus .
tr	3	And it is in the spirit of Christmas that I ask you now to sign these papers my own elven attorneys drew up .
tr	2	This book may be reproduced , copied and distributed for non-commercial purposes , provided the book remains in its complete original form .
tr	1	" I hope I pass those qualifications , " Link sulked as he stuffed his hands in his pockets and lowered his head slightly .
tr	0	The small rush of adrenaline he had felt a moment ago deflated when he saw a small wooden table with a chair .
tr	4	You will have thirty minutes to complete the test , " A soft female voice filled the rather large bare room .
tr	4	" I tied them up with their shoelaces but only pulled the laces out , leaving their shoes on . "
tr	3	The man actually had to turn sideways to squeeze out of the opening , almost ripping buttons off his suit jacket .
tr	4	Ear splitting sirens suddenly echoed through the complex as red and yellow spinning lights rotated wildly , creating a dizzying effect .
tr	4	Colonel Pry flashed his ID to the guard who told whoever he had been speaking to that he would call them back .
tr	4	Almost every building in the universe had video and audio devices of some kind inside , although they might not always be active .
tr	4	He managed to land two hard punches to Jeff 's face , splitting his lips open , before the other three seized him .
tr	1	The tension from this possibility , and a risk of greater punishment , caused his wounds to ache and his stomach to spin .
tr	2	Once the government took control of all the major communication companies of the past , real police work began . "
tr	3	Even though he would only get to ride along in the car , it was better than trash duty or doing mindless yard work .
tr	3	He had to admit he wanted nothing more than to kick Jeff 's head in for getting him in trouble .
tr	4	Every few minutes a beam of light would swing from the window across the trees outside and then disappear again .
tr	2	He shot around to the front of the house and up the porch to find the front door opened a crack .
tr	0	With all his might , he landed a hard blow to the back of the head of the tall male .
tr	0	He placed a hand on the wall to regain his balance as his vision grew dark from the surge of pain clouding his sight .
tr	0	He paused a moment against a porch beam to clear the stars from his head and to get his bearings .
tr	2	This private neighborhood with its lavish houses had almost no traffic so anything out of the ordinary would broadcast its presence .
tr	4	When he reached the shed at the back of their property , he resolved on a place to hide the letter .
tr	4	He explained how he had been working in the backyard when he noticed the intruders , who must not have known he was home .
tr	3	" Did you hear them say anything that might give us a clue as to what they were after ? "
tr	4	A few small groups of people who worked at other warehouses in the area scattered at the sight of the soldiers .
tr	0	The building was a maze of corridors and offices which opened into a spacious assembly line area with loading bay doors .
tr	2	" M -- my b -- brother an -- and I , " the boy pointed to an older boy behind him .
tr	1	He tried his best to walk in a straight line , swallowing another couple of acidic , sour heaves from his stomach .
tr	3	It was as if the brunette had created a digital recording just for him and set the player to loop .
tr	3	" You think you could carry Liquid Light past the security dogs , before you actually made it to the tube ? "
tr	3	If he wasn 't with his two best friends in the world , he wouldn 't have dared bring it up at all .
tr	4	" I mean , if we really work for the people , we should be there to help them . "
tr	2	" Oh , so your mother returning home isn 't enough to make you happy , " his mother winked .
tr	3	A few girls giggled as they passed him , but they continued on , disappointed that he failed to pay them any attention .
tr	1	He didn 't know if he was winded from his quick march or his nervousness at the possibility of the results .
tr	3	He hoped it would return Liquid Light but something in the back of his mind told him that wouldn 't be the case .
tr	4	He placed the section of the note between the two slides and tucked them in the pocket of the lab coat .
tr	3	It wasn 't until after they had completed a DNA test that he discovered something not announced in the news .
tr	4	The professor handed him the checklist , and written in the corner of the already scribbled on paper was the word : Pregnant .
tr	4	This was proof that the government had murdered an innocent woman and they were involved in a lie to cover it up .
tr	4	The problem was , his father always noticed as well , and would raze him the rest of the evening .
tr	2	" She 's not the only one , " his father said and then stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him .
tr	1	His father 's mind was twisted into believing and fighting for something that wasn 't right and was obviously wrong .
tr	0	Glass control booths ran in a semicircle along half the wall and a weapons and equipment area continuing the rest of the way .
tr	0	A squad of ten men strapped on body armor and prepared weapons around a table to the right of the platform .
tr	0	Instead of a vocal response , the leader gave hand signals and the squad began advancing toward the southwest corner .
tr	4	A few of the men split up and investigated the rooms away from the office , their boots shuffling on the tiled floor .
tr	0	On the other hand , making meds to protect yourself against a biological weapon is a capital offense , " the Captain stated .
tr	4	This remark brought more tears and pleading from the older gentleman , but Professor Johnson remained calm and showed little emotion .
tr	1	The land , as far as he could see , consisted of solid black broken rock , which felt strangely soft under his boots .
tr	2	Out of a small building twenty yards back from the mouth of the volcano came two men in military uniform .
tr	3	The Captain removed the electronic card from the top of the confiscated goods and put it back in his pocket .
tr	0	A voice inside his head told him this raid was going to be worse than the last , although he couldn 't fathom how .
tr	4	Their footsteps echoed off the tunnel walls along with dripping water and the squealing of rodents fleeing at their approach .
tr	2	" It looks like you took a rolling pin to the head , " his father said , handing him a bottle of water .
tr	3	His legs wobbled and his head swam , but his desperation to get to the girl at the platform outweighed his discomfort .
tr	3	" You wouldn 't be the first to be swayed by a pretty face , but don 't let it ruin you . "
tr	1	" After that , I will hunt you , and when I find you , I will kill you . "
tr	3	Despite the fact it was still early in the day , the lights hadn 't faded , they 'd simply gone out .
tr	1	The lights came on ; the population went about their business , and life continued in its normal , organised way .
tr	4	We both knew this day was inevitable , but its arrival would take Benton to a whole new level of unhappiness .
tr	4	He was the pessimist , and I was the optimist ; both challenging the other to see the world differently .
tr	4	Trans Central was one monument , all linked together to create an appearance of complete unity ; a beacon for people to aspire .
tr	2	" There isn 't much going on , and the computers aren 't working , so why don 't you go home ?
tr	4	His position entitled him to certain benefits , one of which was a modest unit on the edge of the city border .
tr	1	The efficient unit consisted of one sleeping cubicle , a cooking compartment , a minute cleaning booth , and a main living area .
tr	3	I tied up a bag of rubbish and carried it to the disposal container at the rear of the property .
tr	0	This was the first time I 'd met Minister Drake in person , and I was taken aback by his daunting appearance .
tr	4	Overtime , I 'd learned to subdue my inventive mind and blend into society , but Minister Drake was unable to hide his differences .
tr	0	" Okay , " I said , grabbing my mug and taking a quick gulp of my own lukewarm beverage .
tr	0	One of the problems with having an active imagination is it sometimes takes you to a dark place of fear and panic .
tr	4	" They keep us safe , " my mother once told me " That 's all you need to know . "
tr	4	But there was more to his expression , I sensed a hidden agenda disguised behind an unattractive attempt at a smile .
tr	3	I couldn 't put my finger on it , but there was definitely a hint of deception behind that harmless grin .
tr	4	Tall trees stretched up high above , with branches shooting off the main body spouting leaves that created dense shrubbery above .
tr	4	I thought I was walking at a steady pace , being careful where I stepped so as not to cause too much noise .
tr	4	They moved in packs , searching for their next meal , and this one clearly had its taste buds set on me .
tr	1	I was moving quickly using my fright to drive my body forward , praying I wouldn 't trip and fall .
tr	4	We were scheduled to be bonded in a ceremony that , by tradition , is always performed by the mother of the male .
tr	3	" But this means I 'm not going to have the luxury of flitting back and forth from Trans Central to Danton .
tr	2	I 'm worried that our time together would be so limited ; it wouldn 't be fair on you or me . "
tr	3	" I know you want to be involved in every aspect of my life , but that simply wouldn 't be practical .
tr	4	In my head this all sounded perfectly reasonable ; in reality Zeal would not react in the understanding way I hoped .
tr	4	Her shoulder length jet-black hair , piercing green eyes , button nose and shapely figure were certainly a pleasure to behold .
tr	3	" Neither can I , but it is the most beautiful dress , and it is the most important day in our lives .
tr	4	Zeal , on the other hand , was not one to accept orders easily , especially from an ' oversized male ' .
tr	3	" Step aside , " he said with a threatening attitude , moving to push her out of the way .
tr	1	I was making it up as I went along ; it was times like this I was thankful for my vivid imagination .
tr	3	" Then I suggest you return to your unit and take her with you before she gets you both into trouble . "
tr	1	She was right , I was suspicious of the military presence in Danton , but I didn 't want to fuel Zeal 's paranoia .
tr	1	" It 's not ignorance ; it 's the government deciding what we should know for our own benefit . "
tr	1	I carefully checked each room in the unit , which didn 't take long , but I found nothing out of place or missing .
tr	0	The hour had got late and all I wanted to do was lay my head down and drift off to sleep .
tr	0	I heard a cacophony of chopping , stirring and the occasional ping of a timer as she created a feast to satisfy her hunger .
tr	4	It felt like my home had been invaded by a hostile force bent on spoiling my good night 's sleep .
tr	3	Add this to my jumble of unwanted thoughts ; sleep was a luxury I wasn 't going to be permitted .
tr	1	In situations like this , if I 'm unable to form an opinion , then I 'd rather say nothing at all .
tr	0	My body followed the momentum of the tram , whipping backwards and smashing the back of my head against my headrest .
tr	3	" Oh , erm ... Just a bit of whiplash , " It was my turn to ask a question .
tr	0	" Oh , he won 't be happy , won 't be happy at all , " he said under his breath .
tr	1	With a sinking feeling in my stomach , I quickly followed , attempting to keep up with his rapid pace .
tr	3	In life , there are many things I want to do ; I want to paint a world famous picture .
tr	1	I would live the remainder of my days in a correctional facility with hardened criminals who would bully me daily .
tr	3	' Technical difficulties ' was public relations jargon for , ' We don 't want to tell you the truth . '
tr	0	The pursuer was a slick , black vehicle with silver windows and a body that was low to the ground .
tr	3	" It 's going to get a little bumpy , " Tork warned " What do you mean ' going to ' ? "
tr	4	The entire vehicle pitched forward , and I felt the back lift off the ground then clang back onto the road .
tr	4	I guess you could say I wanted to discover new things , provided I knew what those new things were .
tr	2	No buildings , no people , no signs of civilisation at all ; more importantly , no modes of transport out of the wasteland .
tr	4	I had two choices ; I either followed the Minister to places unknown or endeavoured to leave the region unaccompanied .
tr	0	I looked back at the Trojans assuming they had activated as normal , but the subtle vibration rapidly increased into an immense quake .
tr	1	The sound of grinding metal pierced my ears , and tons of dust was thrown into the air clouding my vision .
tr	1	Up until this day , I hadn 't realised quite how inquisitive I was , but I couldn 't help myself .
tr	1	I hadn 't noticed initially , but the corridor was also on a slight incline taking us ever deeper underground .
tr	3	At first I thought my mind was playing tricks on me , but within seconds the door had completely faded away .
tr	1	The vast space was filled with scientists in white lab coats busily working , flitting from place to place in a cacophony of activity .
tr	4	Each of them had the same peculiar device in their ear that I 'd spotted on Minister Drake the previous day .
tr	4	Minister Drake had been vague with his explanation , and I was keen to hear the reason for her being there .
tr	1	" Firstly ; I 'm not your life partner , and secondly ; I 'm only an aid , a runner .
tr	0	The Hub was impressive , but with no character or soul , it was hardly an inspirational place to live .
tr	1	" Forgive Mr Gorn , " apologised the Minister " His social graces are somewhat ... " " Lacking , " Gorn finished .
tr	3	" I wondered if it would be possible , if it isn 't too much trouble that is , to let her go . "
tr	2	I moved to a stool next to one of the messy worktops and cleared a jumble of items stacked on its top .
tr	1	The lighting kept fading up and down , and you could hear shouting in the background but the words were indiscernible .
tr	2	I want you to report to The Hub so you can coordinate military response for the outer communities from here . "
tr	4	" To be honest sir , I have so many questions I don 't even know where to start . "
tr	1	" I 'm sorry sir , forgive my ignorance , but I don 't know what a ' human ' is . "
tr	2	I perched on the edge of the wooden stool in anticipation of Drake 's tale when Gorn 's voice barked from across the room .
tr	0	In one of our deepest oceans , a craft know as a submarine , was seriously damaged in an attack .
tr	4	" We gave your people the tools and knowledge , but it was your own ingenuity that created your civilisation .
tr	1	Many of your government officials , like Mr Gorn , saw us as invaders , sent here to plunder your world . "
tr	0	They constructed an army of weapons , a deadly armada that would be capable of wiping out my entire culture . "
tr	1	" Only high government officials , a few scientists , and certain high ranking military personnel can transmit the order .
tr	3	I had no solution to this disaster that threatened two worlds ; what they wanted , I simply didn 't have .
tr	4	The smooth walls of the corridor were charred black , and the reflective floor was covered in debris from the collapsing ceiling .
tr	0	A large chunk of the ceiling had fallen on a diagonal at the far end of the passageway , blocking entry to the opening .
tr	3	Stage two - they position themselves at key areas around the Minister 's planet , knocking out all communication systems .
tr	4	Considering the pressure in the Hub had already reached explosive proportions , I was loath to pass on more bad news .
tr	2	" Oh dear , I was hoping it wouldn 't come to this , but you 've left me with no other option . "
tr	3	" He certainly has a lot of aggression towards Earth ... but there was something about you that didn 't sit right with me .
tr	3	I had operatives waiting at Trans Central station , but after the city was evacuated Kron had to ... improvise .
tr	4	In order to find her , he would require the resources of The Hub , and more specifically , my knowledge and experience .
tr	2	My best option was to have him disappear ; of course my son managed to mess that one up . "
tr	1	Legs flapping in the air , his back slapped onto the floor , the weapon slipping out of his grasp .
tr	2	If you thought I was going to spend another minute in that hideous room you had another think coming . "
tr	0	On any normal day , you would have been able to see far into the distant , but this was no normal day .
tr	4	" I 'm a little burnt around the edges , but I can honestly say ... I 've never felt better . "
tr	0	In front of each chair was a plinth roughly half a metre high with a white glass ball that appeared to float in mid-air .
tr	4	When the power failed , the people were scared , they panicked , and countless soldiers and innocent people were hurt . "
tr	3	It 's difficult to accept that everything I was taught was a lie ... " " And that makes you angry . "
tr	2	" After what you 've said , why would you be so willing to be a part of our deception ? "
tr	1	I didn 't know what awaited me in this new world , but I was looking forward to finding out .
tr	1	My dark red skirt and black wife beater matched my black and strawberry colored shoulder length hair yours truly spun into two short pigtails .
tr	1	Do you see me with bleach blonde hair bouncing around saving drowning puppies from rivers -- I didn 't think so .
tr	2	" You know , " Mr. Show Off continued , " there 's more than one way to get you to bend over . "
tr	1	I crossed my arms as if to grab pistols in shoulder holsters and whipped out my hands in the shape of guns .
tr	3	With smoke filled streets and me without a scratch , it didn 't take a genius to know who the winner was .
tr	0	I turned to walk away as one of the wounded men raised his gun and pointed it straight at my back .
tr	1	I turned around surprised as I smiled and waved high up towards the surrounding rooftops to my partner in crime .
tr	3	Atticus laid across the rooftop , embarrassed from my yell -- - he hated it when I did things like that .
tr	4	He said they were valuable but when I had them appraised , they weren 't worth more than the metal used to make them .
tr	3	Said it made them trust him more or something -- I du n no , I wasn 't paying attention .
tr	3	Atticus tried to fire off a few rounds but Marco held him back with hundreds of bullets spitting out at Atticus 's hiding spot .
tr	0	All he could hear was the sound of my laughter faintly echoing off the walls as Atticus and I disappeared into the shadows .
tr	0	I kicked dirt in his face and walked away -- - no way was I letting him off that easy .
tr	2	Booze allowed him to open up and one night in a bar I found he had the gift for violence .
tr	1	To me , it felt like I was some gold digger window-shopping at Tiffany 's , I just had to have him .
tr	3	To put the icing on the cake Atticus never asks about my past and I didn 't care about his .
tr	2	They don 't allow open weapons running around their city so you have to smuggle them inside your baggage or pay off the police .
tr	4	As we crested the top of a hill to the front of our hotel we were hit with a cool breeze .
tr	2	A shiver shot up my spine as I sunk down my moonlit grave to the bottom of the ocean floor .
tr	0	He threw his arms about searching for something solid to grab as I dragged him through the sand into the ocean by his ankle .
tr	4	Finally I let go of him and he sped off back to the blanket as if a shark were right behind him .
tr	0	He started waving his arms around and yelling from the shore at me as I stayed in the water laughing .
tr	3	Chapter Four : King Without A Crown Ever look at someone and just want to punch them in the face ?
tr	1	He was the kind of guy who 'd sell his whole family if it mean saving his own skin for an extra day .
tr	2	I quickly found out that his padded body didn 't improve his ability to hop over walls and dodge behind corners .
tr	2	He and his traveling loonies seemed to follow us around like a bad cold you couldn 't get rid of .
tr	3	Didn 't take them long to spot it ; the problem was that the tree was fenced in and on private property .
tr	4	Did I mention I promised the girls a secret mystery prize for the one to bring me back the orange first ?
tr	4	If they didn 't return with the orange , they run the risk of being the only ones to get disqualified .
tr	3	The ' X ' was still on the half of the orange that wasn 't eaten , so I counted it .
tr	4	" Best get some rest ... and a shower " Atticus wobbled then fell to the ground and passed out .
tr	0	The ocean had long dried up and left the titanic ship stranded in what was now a vast wasteland of sand and rock .
tr	4	He used any chance he got to escape me by staring off and letting his mind wonder to who knows where .
tr	2	" Ha-ha , isn 't it time for you to stuff your face with food , like every other hour of the day ? "
tr	4	In the last couple month 's pirates had been seizing ships , stealing the goods and selling them on the black market .
tr	0	Gas mask , knife , canister holsters and canisters -- I think I 'm actually fully prepared for a change .
tr	2	I turned on my dark side and tried to kick open the door ; it didn 't work but I didn 't care .
tr	4	Aw , where you guys going , " I shouted muffled through my mask , " the buried treasure is this way . "
tr	3	That 's right , flood your tiny brains with anger so you can 't think straight and I buy more time untying myself .
tr	3	Before I knew it I got a hot plate of lobster sitting in front of me making my mouth water .
tr	4	Atticus was tied off over the side of the ship in a way that kept his hands free to hold his sniper rifle .
tr	3	The smoke began to fill up the deck and that 's when I did the most stupid and coolest thing in my life .
tr	2	Most of the crew spread out into the ships cabins and control room leaving our Jack Sparrow wannabe with a few chosen guards .
tr	3	I had to think fast and this time the Second Sun canisters weren 't going to do much with the sun already out .
tr	3	The last thing he wanted was to stay in the water and see what kind of friends he 'd attract .
tr	1	Anything would be better than being humiliated like this for another minute even if it was swimming with the sharks .
tr	1	I 'd just have to wait for Atticus who took his sweet ass time to come save the princess in distress .
tr	2	Because I was holding his hands , his only option was to cry out in pain and drop to the floor .
tr	3	I pulled my coat tighter around me and began to walk next to Atticus to the side of the boat .
tr	4	He handed Atticus a cup and made his way to the next group who let out a yell of cheer as he approached .
tr	4	Ayla was the owner of the place and hadn 't hired any additional help since the place was dead most of the week .
tr	3	Then , as if someone shot a starter pistol , they drank their shots and raced to the middle glass .
tr	0	I was surprised she could stay awake because having Atticus tell you a story was about as fun as watching paint dry .
tr	4	Hello 's were great but goodbye 's always made her feel sad because there 's a chance she may never see that person again .
tr	3	When I had left Atticus that afternoon I went straight to my favorite ice cream spot to pick up an instant sugar rush .
tr	3	After eating and without touching the gift , I paid for my meal and got the hell out of there .
tr	4	By the next morning my leg was feeling fine enough to walk on and I felt I had wasted enough of her time .
tr	2	Atticus and I had snatched a bounty from some goons who cut off our escape so we took refuge in a ratty old house .
tr	4	I felt if I walked around it might come back to me so I walked up to Alita and towered over her .
tr	3	Alita , who 'd just finished putting on her tube turned around and asked , " What 's up ? "
tr	2	" I hope you get a concussion so that it 's my turn NOT to go look for you ! "
tr	0	I think he crapped his pants cause he didn 't say a word back -- like a good little boy .
tr	2	I had already ducked to the ground and wondered how well the door would stand up to a grenade blast .
tr	3	Later that night Atticus walked back through the door , but there was something wrong ; Alita was still with him .
tr	3	" Atticus , why don 't you explain , in GREAT detail , this plan you made without me . "
tr	1	The music felt like an old friend inviting me in for a drink and who was I to say no ?
tr	0	It was as if she had given us a gift and we had no other way to thank her than to applaud for more .
tr	2	I rushed through my morning routine and out the door at ten minutes past -- a new record if I do say so myself .
tr	4	" Please tell me she 's pregnant and that the father is some sort of blind deformed alien zombie from hell . "
tr	0	One being a bag of stuff and the other was a gallon jug of water -- I made Alita carry both .
tr	3	By the time we got to the deck the sun was setting but that was all in my master plan .
tr	3	I spotted an assortment of treats lying on the table and hadn 't eaten lunch so I decided this was a good alternative .
tr	3	If you want my minute you have to pay for it and the more you make me wait the more it costs .
tr	3	That night , after saying goodnight to her father , Alita opened the window and snuck out of the house leaving a ransom note .
tr	1	If I ever run into that little troll again , I think I 'll let my knife give her a nice hug .
tr	3	Thanks to Atticus , we arrived to the train station late only to overhear lowlife 's giving some guy a hard time .
tr	0	It wasn 't his normal laugh -- more like a ' whatever the hot girl says is funny ' type of laugh .
tr	0	The kind of laugh that if it were a actual person you 'd wan na punch it in the face .
tr	0	I 'm a pretty good judge of character and I can 't imagine you any more evil than a puppy . "
tr	3	With my back to the bed , I stuffed the loot in my bra and walked over towards the door .
tr	0	By her calculations , eight hours had gone by since they left the vibrant garden city of Cochabamba , climbing higher and higher into the clouds .
tr	4	She left the country for four months to try to get things together , and when she came back she was teaching literacy classes to Quechua women .
tr	0	With bronze skin , wavy black hair , and perfect Pashto , Alejo never had problems passing as a Pakistani on his many trips to the country .
tr	4	Noah 's eyes were friendly and clueless , and he probably wouldn 't be able to tell if someone was flirting with him to save his life .
tr	4	She already felt the effects of the alcohol as the rum with Coke went down , but all in all , she felt pretty good .
tr	0	The quiet continued as Noah sat down a comfortable distance away on the bench , and stared off towards the stone pillars at the plaza 's center .
tr	1	He stood up and held out his arms to steady her , just as nausea surged and the night began to spin around in circles .
tr	3	" But it 's just not right for me to stay where I am , " Alejo told Stalin , " if I 'm not a Muslim .
tr	2	The picture shoved under the door of his house in Bolivia , a bunch of little kids arriving home from school in uniforms and overstuffed backpacks .
tr	0	Ishmael Khan was a philanthropist , giving away a lot of his wealth to build hospitals and schools here in Pakistan as well as in Bolivia .
tr	0	Still praying , he ducked past a street vendor and a sizzling vat of curry into a winding alleyway , already shadowy in the approaching night .
tr	4	" Well , " Tobin said cheerfully in his lovely accent , " we 've been planning this for quite a while , right guys ?
tr	4	The two of them now sat at one of the caf 's small tables , leisurely spreading jam and margarine onto fresh bread from the corner store .
tr	3	" Call me with any news , " Alejo instructed half-way out the door , then turned back to snatch another brownie off the table .
tr	0	The group had just finished a discussion called " Ethical Questions Related to Justice " and were now lounging around debating and munching granola bars for breakfast .
tr	1	Noah smiled to himself , wiped his sticky fingers on the sides of his shorts , then got up and followed the guys to the truck .
tr	4	The pickup slowed down even more as they rounded a curve in the gravel and came across a girl walking along the edge of the road .
tr	4	he asked her , casually balancing one of his arms on the side of the truck close to her back in case they hit a bump .
tr	1	Noah slid down onto an empty bench right in her path , feet planted on the ground , really hoping she wouldn 't be angry .
tr	3	She was telling all this to the velvet pattern on the back of the seat , terrified to look at Noah and see his disgust .
tr	3	She 'd spent so long trying not to think about it , pretending she was the kind of person who would never act this way .
tr	3	It was one thing to not punish her for her sins , and quite another to still like her , to want to spend time with her .
tr	4	She had to see if she could get up , because Noah had been right beside her , and he had to be right beside her still .
tr	3	Gabriel was staring at Alejo slack-jawed as the rest of the guys gave up and whirled around to head towards their tents , muttering bitterly .
tr	1	In the real world , girls like her didn 't survive bus crashes and get dragged off by a bunch of crazy guys as their prisoner .
tr	4	He let the hair fall back over his ear and they both sat there , smiling , enjoying the moment of feeling like naughty missionaries .
tr	3	The thought occurred to her that there must be a ton of Bolivian girls in love with this guy , and it almost made her laugh .
tr	0	The entire family in the picture was gathered around a square table with a canary yellow tablecloth , eating sundaes in tall , frosty glasses .
tr	3	A shallow , rushing stream cut its way through a dirt patch of the forest just ahead , tripping over small stones in its path .
tr	1	He snapped his long fingers , and then whirled back to continue off to some point in the banana plants where they would be waiting .
tr	2	Obviously deciding not to mention the feet again , Stalin wordlessly took her backpack and motioned for her to follow them back to the camp .
tr	1	Her vision swam as she took in the familiar figures of Stalin and Gabriel , along with two new faces watching them from just inside the tent .
tr	0	He was wearing the same kind of Irish cap he had always worn , along with a casual sweater , jeans , and hiking boots .
tr	2	" I won 't be able to tell if your nose if broken until the swelling goes down , " Alejo said , still maddeningly calm .
tr	4	Alejo pulled the lid off a ballpoint pen with his teeth , scribbled something in the notebook , and flipped the pen and notebook back towards Boris .
tr	0	Alexis had been so kind as to donate a pair of gray jogging pants that had sparkly pink lips on the rear and said Diva .
tr	3	" Not only that , " Alejo 's voice was strained , " but when I left the organization , I put your lives in danger .
tr	2	Alejo opened his mouth to speak as Pablo abruptly pushed one of the wrought-iron chairs across the concrete with his foot , causing a high-pitched scraping sound .
tr	3	" Anyway , believing what I do about Jesus and finding that out meant it was just a matter of time til I left the Prism .
tr	0	Alejo had shivered , staring at the back of his father 's head as he walked towards the metal door that led back downstairs and disappeared .
tr	4	Realizing it wasn 't there , she dove back for the bed , crawled over it , and grabbed the phone vibrating across the nightstand .
tr	3	" He said that he didn 't want to just casually date someone , but that when he started a relationship he wanted it to be serious .
tr	3	But Noah would always say that he thought maybe God wanted him to be single , since God hadn 't brought the right girl along yet .
tr	0	One was a blond boy , about six years old , wearing a Star Wars t-shirt and grinning at the camera while missing both front teeth .
tr	0	The woman dissolved into tears again and her husband put one hand stiffly on her arm , obviously embarrassed by how his wife was carrying on .
tr	1	It didn 't seem realistic to imagine Noah just punching him in the shoulder with a , Hey man , don 't worry about it .
tr	3	If you don 't come out with the girl and come with me , he 'll have to take the guys ' parents out . "
tr	4	The phone receiver crashed to the floor as he raced to the stairs and leaped down them , skidding at the bottom and sprinting towards the door .
tr	3	Alejo 's head buzzed , and his throat tightened as he turned to stare at the cows and tall white grass whizzing by outside the van .
tr	1	Alejo 's visions of gaining the advantage through his fighting skills died down as he saw what Benjamin and Stalin gripped casually by their sides .
tr	3	" Stalin has been trying to tell me that this was a case of youthful indiscretion , that you were attracted to this girl ? "
tr	2	Five tan , modern-looking stories rose out of an adobe house neighborhood , and the truck had stopped right in front of the main entrance .
tr	0	How could she tell them what had happened , that the son they had just found as a killer had been shot and could die ?
tr	4	The morning was silent , except for the sound of a few song birds flitting around the coral and white flowering trees in the neighborhood .
tr	4	All the rooms of the huge house were absolutely silent , and the slapping of Gabriel 's bare feet across the shiny black tiles echoed loud .
tr	4	In the corner of the room , boxes of explosives and electronics were scattered , like a kids ' Legos dumped out onto the tiles .
tr	3	He had refused to say anything else about the Hotel Diplomat , but the way his jaw was set announced that the news wasn 't good .
tr	3	The two just stood there , nodding and grinning as if there were nothing strange about a man getting his sight back by the power of God .
tr	2	" We 're going to get you into some clothes like ours , so we won 't stand out on our little trip away from here . "
tr	3	For thirty minutes they rode out of the city , then turned off the main road to follow a rugged path cut through a cornfield .
tr	4	Leaving the bathroom , Alejo could hear the soft clink of silverware coming from the kitchen , around the corner from the end of the hall .
tr	4	Another perk of working with him -- along with the fact that he had dreams of the future and seemed to hear directly from God .
tr	2	" It 's really not that complicated , Alejo , " he continued slowly , as if explaining something to a small , particularly dull child .
tr	2	Her laptop was open next to her on the couch and she was alone in the living room , listening to the sound of Noah 's voice .
tr	0	It was also fascinating , given the fact that Stalin believed he already knew everything about God and had said he would rather have his carnal pleasures .
tr	4	There really was no hurry ; in Spain , no one went to bed before midnight , and at the moment it was just after seven .
tr	0	My daddy has written three books , and he has a whole room for a library with all kinds of fat books about everything you can imagine .
tr	0	Urgent hands still held him down , kneeling , and Sami realized he was facing the crowd , saw that Ava was looking up towards heaven .
tr	4	I hope you never have to get in a fight , but I feel better knowing you 're learning some tricks to keep up your sleeve . "
tr	4	We had started up a steep snow face well before dawn and after day break , the skies looked clear and the winds were light .
tr	4	As he moved , I paid out the rope , holding him in case he lost his footing and slipped off the edge of the cliff .
tr	0	Hand over hand , I reached for anything that I could grab , each time , double checking that Isaac was taking up the slack .
tr	2	Out of breath , out of strength and out of my mind , I jump backward and dropped to the snow slope next to Isaac .
tr	0	Like the stride of a gazelle , he bounded across the front lawn with amazing speed and agility , his adrenaline pumping at full capacity .
tr	1	Knowing this was their only hope of survival , Trae crawled to the front door and tried to wrap his fingers around the lower corner .
tr	3	Sitting patiently on an elevated boulder , a young boy hung his makeshift fishing pole over the water in an attempt to catch his breakfast .
tr	1	In the morning sun , under the direction of the regimental captain , the men formed a human chain that led from boat to horse-drawn wagons .
tr	4	The previous day , June 6th , Dr. Jeb Morgan prepared one of the supply wagons as a makeshift operating table in preparation for the impending battle .
tr	3	Within arm 's reach , he placed his instruments first ; a basin and canteen of water next ; then cotton batting and other bandages last .
tr	4	The shell tore through his uniform , flesh and ribcage , instantly killing him even before the shell 's internal mechanisms sensed the pressure of impact .
tr	4	As other shells exploded into and around the stunned , helpless soldiers , the same gory results affected the devastating loss of the entire company .
tr	0	As the Union sharpshooters unleashed their hail of shot , balls of lead sailed through the air with an awful shrill , telegraphing their intentions .
tr	4	As bullets passed over his head , he heard their whistle , and for a moment forgot about his injury as a sense of self-preservation overtook him .
tr	3	Standing behind the patient , dressed in uniform with their bloody smocks still fastened to them , several military doctors stood proudly for the photo .
tr	0	There , several yards away , he watched as a man dressed in a blue military uniform stood over another man laying on a wooden gurney .
tr	3	He thought it strange that he ended up at the ground floor , as he had not pushed any of the buttons on the panel .
tr	4	He heard screams of agony and realized that the sounds he 'd been hearing were not thunder after all , but were in fact artillery explosions .
tr	2	With a quick look over David 's shoulder , then back to his patient on the wooden wagon , the doctor refocused on his duty .
tr	4	My assistants mean well but are bumbling country boys , if you understand my inference , " the old doctor said as he winked at David .
tr	3	David determined that with careful cleaning and repair , the leg could be saved , although without antibiotics , the post treatment would be problematic .
tr	3	He knew the old doctor was losing his patience , and with that lost , he too was losing what little credibility he might have had .
tr	3	Once again , David did his best to rinse and clean the wound with the salted water solution , and then sterilize it with the distilled alcohol .
tr	3	It was habit , I guess , from following my mom ( not that my mom has a big butt , she doesn 't ) .
tr	0	It felt just like something was chasing us , but when I looked back all I saw was the red wall of that strange place .
tr	0	Her nametag said ' Mabel Jackson ' and I glanced down at my own chest to see that somehow I had a stick-on nametag , too .
tr	0	Your dad didn 't get to know him because your grandfather had had a big fight with him a long time ago and they quit speaking . "
tr	0	It was always too far and we couldn 't afford the trip , but now it 's just a four or five hour drive away .
tr	3	They had no trouble finding Gunther Road or the next six turns but they both agreed that it was taking too long and they were hungry .
tr	3	There was a huge porch across the entire front with two large porch swings to the right and the left of the double front doors .
tr	1	Missy was half expecting an old Santa Claus or else a gruff old Scrooge type but what she noticed first was a big grinning smile .
tr	3	Kevin walked straight to the bottom of the stairs and opened a small , three-foot high door to a small space under the stairs and landing .
tr	3	A little light went on automatically , like opening the refrigerator , and there was a string to pull to switch on another brighter light bulb .
tr	0	There was a packet of papers tied with a string , a small metal box full of medals , an old photo album and some yellowed newspapers .
tr	4	She liked Kevin and he seemed to be easy to get along with even though a few times he acted like he knew more than she did .
tr	4	The head media specialist helped her search the Internet and they found a site that offered a book of instructions on how to construct your own .
tr	3	It would be a neat place to spy on visitors , she had thought the first time she had driven by with her mother last March .
tr	0	It was a quaint resort on a small lake and boasted a large lodge , several smaller cabins and lots of fun things to do .
tr	1	Kevin rolled his eyes at Missy and said , " Man , would I be in trouble if I lied to my parents like that . "
tr	3	They 're such jerks that they 'd probably love to ruin the ancient drawings that are down there , once they find out about them . "
tr	2	" Well , well , well , " Lonnie said , " if it isn 't little Mr. Jackson , son of big Mr. Jackson .
tr	3	Missy and Kevin stood like statues listening to the two jerks above them struggle to drag a rusty old wood stove over the trap door .
tr	3	There were two other ways out up through Mount Rocky , as they called that high hill , but that would mean a longer walk home .
tr	4	He stopped paddling and stared at the clear blue sky then he looked across the lake at the lodge and all the little log cabins .
tr	3	One of the first times he brought Missy on this tunnel he had turned out the light to show her just how black it was down here .
tr	4	Dave stretched out on his belly and extended his arms out moving them side to side as if he were making a face down snow angel .
tr	2	" We forgot one thing , " Ricky said , " they 're gon na want to know how the canoe and paddles got put back . "
tr	1	Since we wouldn 't want their parents to panic when they don 't show up for dinner , here 's what you can do . "
tr	2	They bumped and knocked around on the seat , Missy holding on for dear life , until Kevin took a side trail out to the main road .
tr	4	Dave was scanning the lake and except for a fisherman in a rowboat there wasn 't anyone else out beyond the swimming area across the lake .
tr	4	It was dangerous for the rider because the saddle could slide over and pitch the rider to the ground when they were cantering around a corner .
tr	4	Lonnie felt a bit angry by the girl 's remark and pointed at the tallest horse and said , " I 'll ride him . "
tr	4	Kevin was glad he was on the obedient gelding and instead of being intimidated by the seventeen-year-old , he crouched down and gave Keno a definite command .
tr	4	Ricky scolded , then he laughed as Lonnie tumbled to the trampled earth , his weak knees giving way as soon as his feet hit the ground .
tr	4	He stopped and stared until he was sure it was Dave , Rob and the two pretty sisters he had waited on in the Snack Shack .
tr	4	Secretly , Dave was relieved that they didn 't remember four summers ago when he and Rob had chased several girls off the swimming dock .
tr	0	It was dark , pitch black , blind , and Tommy screamed , too , trying to winch his way back from where he had come .
tr	2	The room on the left was Billy 's and he would complain that he always got the smaller room , but really he didn 't mind .
tr	2	He grabbed the top two , a book and a comic book , closed the trunk and hurried out , careful to close the door quietly .
tr	3	The stairway in this old house was narrower and steeper than most and he had taught Billy to slide down the treads on his rump .
tr	4	He listened to the sounds of summer : birds , traffic , a plane up above , and , somewhere , the sound of kids laughing .
tr	3	Then she cracked off the rounded top of the walking stick and bit into it as she shoved the rest of the stick in Tommy face .
tr	3	Tommy was just beginning to worry about getting thirsty when he broke off a piece and saw that the hollow center was filled with liquid .
tr	3	It became a game and he got better and faster , but he was not paying attention to anything around him other than the trail .
tr	3	He set the two torches down in the middle of the area and ran from wall to wall collecting and pitching the flaming sticks into the center .
tr	2	Well , I could , but now you know how to get out so , well , uh ... " The two boys stared at each other .
tr	3	Tommy explained about gum then added as an afterthought , " It is a type of magic in that you can chew it for just about forever .
tr	3	To Tommy 's surprise the prince threw the gum straight over his head toward a wall where it smacked onto a colorful tapestry and stuck .
tr	4	It was some dirty , stinky homeless man who would ride the trains for free and beg for food and then steal chickens and stuff from farmers .
tr	3	I thought that was a little off the subject until he added , " Guess the ants haven 't had time to rebuild their little mounds .
tr	0	This is why we have agreed to search the atlas for a suitable island only as a hypothetical query meant to challenge our geographical aptitudes .
tr	3	My mind clutches to the light , hoping that it is a police car , but there are no sirens , and the headlights jump away .
tr	0	Chapter 4 A long ragged scream tears out of me , and its echo jumps around the room like a mad animal I have unleashed .
tr	2	My mind is so fogged , the need so great that I 'm not sure just how much control I wield over my own limbs .
tr	4	I rake it up into my arms , and the puppy gives a single fearful yelp before the orbs in my hands latch to its energy field .
tr	3	My body is sore all the way into my bones and joints , and I worry that my skin might split open at the slightest pressure .
tr	4	Keeping them there , because what I really want to do is latch onto Gabe 's energy field or aura or whatever it is and drain him .
tr	3	I can 't imagine what I must look like right now , but evidently it evokes enough pity that he says , " Gary Cook .
tr	0	In the backseat , I tug against my handcuffs and enjoy the sparks of pain that alight as the plastic presses against the open wounds .
tr	3	It crosses my mind that no matter how nice Gabe seems to be , I 'm sitting in a car with two very dangerous psychopaths .
tr	4	I look out the window , watch the road streaming beneath our wheels , carrying me farther and farther away from ... well , everything .
tr	1	His body -- back , arms , neck -- is composed entirely of straight lines , like he was welded into position with no hinges .
tr	2	In a quiet voice he says , " Mom told me that she took comfort knowing that you were out in the world living a normal life .
tr	1	Not when my hands are growing hot , and I must make a mental effort to keep the skin on my palms from rolling back .
tr	4	Maya even had a dad who would say " hey there kid " when they passed each other on the roads of their very separate lives .
tr	3	" Oh , well , it 's nice to meet you , but you better watch out for this one , " Francesca nods towards Gabe .
tr	1	" We weren 't planning on having anyone over , " he clarifies , " but it 's , I don 't know , pretty big .
tr	1	I think she might be beautiful , but my mind is rushing in so many different directions I can hardly pull out any coherent thoughts .
tr	0	But no , her brown hair is twisted into neat braids , and she has bright , golden eyes that are unafraid of the camera .
tr	2	Pulling myself up and over onto the roof is surprisingly easy , though I know I wouldn 't have been able to do it before .
tr	2	There 's a note of bravado in his voice while he offers this explanation , and all of this is so wrong , so dark and twisted .
tr	0	Gabe lists them off : Mixed Martial Arts on Monday and Wednesday , Krav Magna on Friday and Sunday , CrossFit on Tuesday and Thursday .
tr	3	I think it 's going to topple sideways , but with a grunt he gets it up and drops it with a heavy clang onto the rack .
tr	4	I remember taking her out after school and putting her in my lap , amazed that I owned this living , breathing , wonderful creature .
tr	1	I find myself wandering the interlocking pathways , making sure the trains are still running , the buildings are stable and humming with productive work .
tr	3	I want to make an effort ; I want to demonstrate that this will somehow work , even if I 'm not sure I believe it .
tr	4	No orange juice in the fridge , so I include a glass of milk and a small plate of strawberries on the side of the tray .
tr	0	Now of course , things are different ... but anyway , one day Tammy came back from a solo mission saying she had a lead on Grand .
tr	3	We are both lost , tears sliding down our faces , stomachs stitching up , our manic laughter peeling out and fretting the birds nearby .
tr	1	I try to match his detached air , pushing back my shoulders and setting my face into a disaffected expression with a hint of grimace .
tr	3	There are so many questions flitting through my mind all twisted and warped with the heat and my weeping muscles and the song with its claws out .
tr	3	" Wait , " I can 't keep the disappointment out of my voice , " I thought she was , like , Amazon Mom .
tr	4	When I close my eyes , I can see her face perfectly , the way it was in the beach photograph on the bookshelf in my bedroom .
tr	1	Their words echo in my mind , growing loud and mean : lab animal , dealing with , anything , anything , anything could set her off .
tr	1	I press on with my questions , but teasing answers from the brothers is about as easy as moving a pile of sand using chopsticks .
tr	0	" We jumped him , and he was all crying , saying he didn 't have any money and his cat had leukemia or something .
tr	4	When the sun finally peeks up over the horizon , I wonder why it seems so weary , so slow to extend its light to us .
tr	0	Gabe and I find an animal shelter , and I learn that his hands are just as deft on locks and alarm systems as video game controllers .
tr	4	I wish I could tell him how sorry I am that I never -- not once -- tried to reach over and pull us closer together .
tr	1	Gabe 's voice is rising , and so is the hunger , filling up the car with its melody and making my head champagne dizzy .
tr	3	I think about Ryan , but he has no eyes -- just worms crawling out of the empty sockets , so I don 't think of him .
tr	3	The worst stain of all I save for last and scrawl it hastily on the bottom line , crowding the letters to make it fit .
tr	4	While we receive instructions from a search organizer , I keep my head down and pretend to study the flyer of Sunshine 's smiling face .
tr	2	I follow closely behind Gabe , trying not to wobble as I catch more scents and attempt to process the cacophony of new sounds around us .
tr	3	Why do I still lose my breath at random moments in the night , paralyzed with the conviction that this can 't possibly be real ?
tr	2	We were trying to figure out what to do , how to keep you safe , you know , without completely ruining your life . "
tr	1	I feel helpless , melding with this branch , thinking about nail files , waiting for something to come down and try to kill my brother .
tr	4	We make it back to the car , and I can already hear the cry of police sirens pitching in the distance , growing louder .
tr	4	Here she was with a newborn in her arms , and she 'd just learned that her geeky , scientist husband 's been battling superhuman monsters .
tr	2	" You know , if you can buy a full meal for a dollar , it 's probably not really food , " I tell him .
tr	4	Maybe I could forgive her , or at least tell her that I really do understand about the hunger and the things it made her do .
tr	3	It is to lay flowers upon his grave and wish him well in whatever comes after this , though I suspect there isn 't anything at all .
tr	0	Amber said I had an aura , small and ugly though it was , which means there is still a part of me that is human .
tr	4	She currently writes a paranormal adventure series , Girl With Broken Wings , and a tongue-in-cheek vampire humor short story series , The Vampire 's Housekeeper Chronicles .
tr	1	" I 'm 24 , " I tell him , though I 'm pretty sure it 's illegal to discuss age in a job interview .
tr	0	" You said , ' We are all ready to go , " ' Taylor asked Hunt , " Where are our two tourists anyway ? "
tr	4	There was a short moment of silence before whispering and murmurs started all over the room , as several delegates seemed interested to learn more .
tr	0	Taylor knew that he was banking on his reputation for having his head screwed on the right way but for right now this was all he had .
tr	2	" You gon na have to take me too , " he insisted , " No way I 'll let you go on this adventure alone .
tr	4	A small flight service office , which managed the airport with a handful of people , providing basic conveniences to the pilots and airplane crews .
tr	1	He was very aware of the importance this trip had for Taylor but he still found the intensity and unfamiliar seriousness of his friend amusing .
tr	0	It was a sturdy little aircraft in camouflage paint with big tires and ample ground clearance to make starting and landing from unimproved sites a breeze .
tr	4	She then took out the battery of her tiny cell phone , dropped it into the proper recycle bin and casually slipped the phone into the trashcan .
tr	0	After the buyout of my first company a few years later I snatched up all his rights for a few hundred thousand bucks from him .
tr	0	Not that anyone really cared at that stage , but Washington , as always , was all about not loosing face and covering their tracks .
tr	0	The wall across his desk was covered with an array of computer screens that displayed all sorts of information at the push of a button .
tr	1	The system of total control and manipulation by government and corporations had depended on the constant , immediate and unsuspecting access to an overwhelming part of society .
tr	4	Special interest titles were downloaded to memory cards for display in the classroom computers and the regular lesson material was accessed directly from central education server banks .
tr	0	Many short lived attempts of reorganizing larger areas under common administrations ended in all out confrontations between loosely organized paramilitary groups and armed street gangs .
tr	4	A few minutes after they had first seen the deserted highway corridor Hunt spotted the remains of the road they were looking for leading north .
tr	1	The tension in the back cabin was electric and Tim Farmer winced just a tiny bit as Helen Spade 's fingernails dug into his thigh .
tr	3	Hunt replied , " Remember , I was the one who tried to point out that the probability of your stories being true is slim at best .
tr	2	Taylor laughed , " You are not getting out of using your legs for something else than balancing yourself on a bar stool for a change .
tr	4	Taylor looked the airplane over one more time and satisfied with what he saw he took the lead and marched out in a northern direction .
tr	3	I want to eat it with potatoes and beans next summer , " Taylor laughed , " And Tim , please stop calling me sir . "
tr	2	" Let 's keep going for an hour or two more and then look for a place to set up camp , " Taylor suggested .
tr	1	" The kid said he 'll be along in a minute , " Cody announced dropping the wood on the ground and began building a campfire .
tr	4	We were flying surveillance and minor ground attacks in little stinger jets against raiders and pirates who wanted to establish a bridgehead in the swamps .
tr	3	The surrounding woods had had ample opportunity over the past two hundred years to claim back the trenches that man had cut into its canvas .
tr	4	" Man , Taylor , " Cody Hunt drowned out the other 's questions , " you were quite the flirt back there , nice going .
tr	4	" This place makes me feel silly , " Hunt admitted , " do you think there really is a town somewhere out here ? "
tr	1	Soon it flew around the corner gleaming in all colors of the rainbow in the morning sun coming to a screeching halt right in front of them .
tr	3	" Great , " now Taylor was getting excited , " get your gear and let 's see that we can get this thing rolling . "
tr	2	You would blow a fuse behind that philosopher 's forehead of yours trying to figure me out , " they both laughed and hugged again .
tr	0	Farmer didn 't know if he was led on by this rancher or if he just had met a mathematician with a hang for raising cattle .
tr	3	Turner didn 't want to keep the cattle in the corrals over night so they had to get all the DNA scans done before nightfall .
tr	0	Right after the DNA rodeo had begun in the corrals Taylor asked Lilly Ann about having a go at tuning up her van 's engine .
tr	4	No matter the outcome , the sheer life-giving thrill of attempting the seemingly impossible made it worth the risk of losing her car a thousand fold .
tr	3	He turned this and that screw , loosened and tightened threads and bolts as if to get an innate feeling for function of the apparatus .
tr	3	" What in the ... , " she started trying to stay serious through her upcoming laughter , " what did you do to my little van ?
tr	1	It was hard to predict for an outsider how rapidly these clouds would get bunched up against the rising terrain to form a solid shield of rain .
tr	3	It took them less than an hour until everyone was strapped into their seats , doors closed and Taylor and Hunt working through the preflight checklist .
tr	4	Taylor taxied the plane to the downwind end of the field to give them enough room to clear the tall trees on the southern side .
tr	3	Spade and Farmer had each other 's hands clenched in a tight grip to give support and comfort for the other in this for them unfamiliar situation .
tr	2	He opened the door and turned his head for one last look onto the place that had brought so many hours of joy for him .
tr	4	They would have to cover a distance of about four hundred miles , which they should be able to cross within about three to four weeks .
tr	3	The prospect of substantially improved food resources though , instilled hope throughout the fabric of society that by far surpassed the initial scope of the project .
tr	0	" He had a bad fall , " Joe Jack was an epitome of understatement , " Lilly , what shall we do with him ? "
tr	2	Lilly Ann had pulled a little red divan next to Taylor 's bed and had made herself comfortable with a big pillow and a soft quilt .
tr	2	" Of course , how could you know " she explained at the unspoken question mark on his face , " your tale is all over town .
tr	3	I do have burning questions with no answers as of yet , but if you ladies say it is time to eat , let 's eat . "
tr	3	The arrangement of plates , saucers and utensils on the tray exuded an artistic quality akin to still life paintings from the great masters of old .
tr	0	The tea was rich in aroma and had a strong tart aftertaste that reminded him of root brews he had enjoyed while visiting with natives in Alaska .
tr	2	" They didn 't follow you , " Lilly Ann explained , " they are always working in the woods , cutting logs for their sculptures .
tr	2	" What do you mean , not much to it , " Taylor looked at her incredulously , " this is a bona fide miracle .
tr	3	How about we say that we all did what we thought was the right thing to do given the circumstances and leave it at that .
tr	3	She handed it to Taylor with the disclaimer , " There is a bit of artistic freedom and abstraction in the way I tell stories .
tr	0	Taylor asked , " I am familiar with the story but always thought of it as a historical fable of ancient Middle Eastern peoples . "
tr	3	" Okay , this is a lot to take in , but for the argument 's sake let 's assume that your statements are correct .
tr	2	" Good questions , John , " Edie May acknowledged , " First , you don 't have to do or know anything special to do this .
tr	2	If you know it or not , whatever you give your attention to will cause an equivalent vibration to show up in your experience . "
tr	4	Unable to say a word he lingered for a moment longer , looking at that first picture and with a tear filled sigh he turned the page .
tr	4	Most of all he wants to have fun and be silly and play and bask in the good feeling moment and appreciate and he loves everything . "
tr	0	She looked at Edie May and then at Taylor and said with unwavering conviction , " Good feels good , and bad feels bad . "
tr	3	" That 's right , " Lilly Ann conceded just for a second , " but you always can reach for a better feeling thought . "
tr	4	His wife 's sleepy voice came from their bed , " John has got his legs back , that 's got ta hurt for a while .
tr	2	" That 's no fair , " Lilly Ann complained , " How am I supposed to get an airplane right now to jump out of ? "
tr	2	" Not so fast , " Taylor shouted after her , " you could let me borrow a bathrobe or something and give me a hand .
tr	2	Don 't try to make it happen , " she coached , " There is no rush you 'll run soon enough after you start walking . "
tr	2	" Well , Jack and Joe Jack went back out to the woods so you will have to settle for me for right now . "
tr	4	Edie May gently pushed one of the buttons on the pointing device , which prompted some text and images to be displayed on the screen .
tr	3	" John , you probably know better than I do the history this country and the whole world lived through at the end of the twenty-first century .
tr	0	The most significant historic fact for us was the sudden evacuation of many rural and remote areas for political and security reasons at that time .
tr	4	Edie May looked at Lilly Ann 's face to see if Taylor 's statement of doubt did in any way effect how she felt about him .
tr	4	And , some of you emphasize , that you have heard that after you die there are more rewards for those who struggled the most . "
tr	3	She stood , quietly basking in the loving energy that radiated through the study hall as she watched the two cautiously make their way out the door .
tr	1	Students of literally all ages were buzzing in and out of various doors , sometimes by themselves , sometimes in small groups heatedly discussing their favorite subjects .
tr	0	She had that look on her face that said , ' How do I say this so even a man from Mars could understand ? '
tr	4	" Everything , " Lilly Ann agreed , " one can learn everything there is to know about life while standing at a river to fish . "
tr	4	" No way , " Lilly Ann shrieked and ran to the beached end of the tree trunk and jumped off into the soft sand laughing hysterically .
tr	0	Chapter 12 : Just Ask Lilly Lilly Ann and Taylor had waved good-bye to Louis , the fisherman , and walked back towards the Sudbury main building .
tr	3	" You mentioned that before , " Taylor was still skeptical , " but to me this still sounds a bit like an easy way out .
tr	3	Lilly Ann started to be concerned that his brain would catch fire if he kept devouring all that heavy intellectual stuff at the rate he was going .
tr	2	" That should not surprise you , " Lilly Ann laughed , " every child in town is called Lilly at an early age . "
tr	3	Since most of the first settlers had their own way of looking at every day things a few started to name their boys Lilly too .
tr	3	They are still very much in touch with their inner reality and so they act much more from their inner truth than from outer circumstances .
tr	3	" That I see , " Taylor laughed , " the girl this afternoon positively knew that I had no idea how to draw a hamster .
tr	2	Many of them will tell you flat out ' Go ask Lilly , I am Lilly Ann " or whatever their chosen name might be .
tr	2	It was a rare occurrence that someone would waltz into town and try to pick up their whole philosophy and way of life from scratch .
tr	4	" Behave yourself Michael , " she scolded still laughing , " or I will finish our walk on the other side of the street . "
tr	4	" No , " René repeated , " if you think you do something for someone else you are just delegating the responsibility for your own happiness .
tr	1	" Well , I always take responsibility for my actions , " Taylor insisted , " If I screw up , I 'll fix it .
tr	3	He shuddered at the thought of how much time it might take for him to fully live what he had just begun to understand intellectually .
tr	3	" Let 's raid dad 's closet , " Lilly Ann was excited at the prospect of having another reason to dig through her father 's stuff .
tr	3	" Are you sure he won 't mind , " Taylor cautioned , " I don 't want to get you in trouble with him . "
tr	4	He always used his time in the hot water to stretch and massage his muscles , which were still recovering from the after effects of his injuries .
tr	1	He was getting a little concerned about the dinner part of Lilly Ann 's plans until he sat down to put on socks and shoes .
tr	0	Two beautiful black Clydesdale draught horses , at least nineteen hands tall , stood in bright red and gold harness , calmly waiting to pull their carriage .
tr	4	A band of seven musicians had arranged themselves under the big oak tree and got warmed up with a wild tune of Eastern European heritage .
tr	0	Mr. Big tiptoed around the bed in Lilly Ann 's room , unsure if he was welcome as usual since an unfamiliar occupant was still fast asleep .
tr	3	" Not knowing what that device was , the little guy just thought that this was the obvious way to get the lights back on .
tr	1	" It 's just this old building from before the war , " Lilly Ann explained , " I think it was some kind of market .
tr	0	Part of the sign is still there , it says , ' Wal ' and a star , so we call it Wal Star . "
tr	3	" Nothing so far , " Tom admitted , " but with the two of you here that 's going to change , I 'm sure . "
tr	1	" You are being silly , " Lilly laughingly chastised him , " on the other hand , this looks pretty , like wind chimes .
tr	3	The heavy chain was still wrapped tightly around the tree but the hydraulic arm of the tractor stood limp with no pressure to work its magic .
tr	0	They both ran off to the nearby barn and the man pointed at a huge farm machine that was covered under thick dust and straw clippings .
tr	1	" Well , come on in , " Fritz invited him , " you have to try this new schnapps I 've been distilling in winter . "
tr	2	If you want to eat well , we can go out , have someone else cook for us , or you can learn to cook yourself .
tr	3	" O.k. , that is not exactly the reaction I was hoping for , " Taylor was getting a bit insecure , " but , fair enough .
tr	2	" All right , " Taylor tried not to get defensive , " what would be a good reason for you to get married ? "
tr	3	Taylor felt a lot more secure and in control wearing the proper attire for a first visit with his soon to be mother in law .
tr	3	" You know what , " he said to Lilly Ann , " I don 't need to know everything right this red hot minute .
tr	1	The wedding preparations were in full swing and more often than not Taylor found himself being in the way with no idea how to contribute .
tr	0	It had become very obvious to him that this was a woman 's affair and that a masculine touch to the proceedings was neither welcome nor appreciated .
tr	3	The path that led up from the street to the festival grounds was well worn from thousands of visitors who had climbed the incline throughout the decades .
tr	2	" It is great to meet you John , " Michael said with a soft but intense voice , " I heard so much good about you .
tr	1	" Ah , don 't mention it , brother , " Willie waved him off , " I 'm glad you had fun , I sure did .
tr	4	As he slipped into the bed Lilly Ann greeted him with closed eyes and a sleep drunken voice , " Did you like the girls ? "
tr	4	The female members of the bride 's family had gathered early in the morning in Lilly Ann 's house to help her with her personal preparations .
tr	4	Let the earth they stand on feel the lightness of their hearts and let the birds in the sky sing the joy of their souls . "
tr	4	As much as I dislike the idea , but it is conceivable that at some point one can have his fill and be ready for something new .
tr	3	She took a glass filled with the best schnapps in the house from a tray that was offered to her and lifted it high into the air .
tr	4	He did not know how he knew , but he knew when the time was right to pile logs under the still and light the fires .
tr	3	I knew right away that this was not the effect of light reflections or anything like that , but I sure don 't know what I saw .
tr	4	" You are right , " Lilly Grace had an amused note in her voice , " I most certainly am none of the above . "
tr	3	Next thing we know , we sit at a table in the tavern with a couple cats sitting nearby and looking at us very curiously .
tr	2	... " Knock , knock , " Lilly Ann cautiously opened the door to the tool shed , which Taylor had converted to his artist studio .
tr	2	" It 's a pleasure to meet you , Wilbur , " Taylor vigorously shook the young man 's hand , " so you like metal sculptures .
tr	2	Taylor looked at Wilbur with a mixture of admiration and curiosity , " So , what would you call yourself , determined or nuts ? "
tr	3	" This is good work , " Taylor ran his hands over the tightly stretched hull , " Do you actually want to fly this thing ? "
tr	4	" That 'll do , " Taylor chuckled , " we 'll do another test once we have the engine and all the missing parts in . "
tr	3	They designed control surfaces and attached them to the stabilizers , routed cables through the fuselage and made them functional with proper flight controls in the cockpit .
tr	3	" No use to whine about it , " Taylor got to business , " Let 's tear it down and see what we got . "
tr	4	He had been too excited to sleep , so he had decided to drive out into the woods to a friend 's place for a special pickup .
tr	4	Wilbur ran a big circle around the wing of the airplane , climbed into the second seat behind Taylor 's and fastened his safety belt .
tr	3	A few minutes of slow but steady climb brought them to a safe altitude to level off and try to turn the plane for the first time .
tr	2	" Well , that 's right up my alley then , I 'm the queen of all things silly , " Lilly Ann announced dramatically .
tr	2	Some would call you devil and some would call you lord , and none of them would rest until they see you nailed to a cross . "
tr	3	They thought it quite possible that Esther would find herself in this situation if people started to mix up what was Abraham and what was her . "
tr	4	He doesn 't go looking for trouble , but he doesn 't back away from it either , and it always finds him , believe me .
tr	3	She 's been through hard times , as most of the people that I 've known , but she doesn 't know a bitter thought .
tr	4	" So true , " Taylor nodded , " I believe that I have to find a way to help them , as you have helped me .
tr	1	" Exactly , " Lilly Ann nodded and kissed him gently , " think and feel , and then think some more and feel again .
tr	2	You are doing so exceptionally well , John Taylor , and from what you 've been telling me , so are most of your friends . "
tr	2	Taylor remarked , " But if that 's not it I 'll be happy to carry you to the bedroom to have a closer look . "
tr	0	Tears of joy were streaming down his face and all he was able to stammer was , " Thank you , thank you , thank you . "
tr	3	They sat on the old kitchen bench for a long time , embracing each other tightly , trying to adjust to the onslaught of almost unbearable bliss .
tr	3	Without even trying to find an answer to this impossible question he sat on the bed and tried to pull Lilly Ann into his arms .
tr	1	" This is not going to do this time , " Lilly Ann pouted , " I need an answer and I need it now . "
tr	0	I want our Lilly to have a real mommy and not just a playmate who doesn 't know how to take care of her baby . "
tr	0	I know for a fact that we will have a very smart kid , so she must have had her good reasons , right ? "
tr	0	Above the mountain of her fear , through the haze of her tears rose a bright beacon of light , casting away shadows and doubt .
tr	0	Before Teddy could say anything I totally agreed with him and headed full steam towards a purplish apparition ( with green stripes ) that was parked nearby .
tr	0	He willingly accepted , and from that moment on everything was to be done ' ship shape and Bristol fashion ' , and nautical terminology became mandatory .
tr	0	Apparently her husband had recently passed away and she was now left with a crashed Hunter and some odd bits and pieces - in Switzerland .
tr	3	' Too right sunshine ( or words to that effect ) , but what about all my bits and pieces in the old hangar ? '
tr	2	' The pilot says the load is OK now , and it seems such a pity to go so few kilometres after so much trouble ( ? )
tr	0	' But please be assured that no one will be allowed to even touch an aircraft that doesn 't have the highest civilian and military qualifications ' .
tr	3	A lunatic little girl wanted to steal a single seat Hunter , but first she had asked him ' please , where is the starter button ? '
tr	3	Fatty ( 1 ) , El Gordo , was the first one to notice that Caroline wasn 't writhing and screaming and begging for mercy .
tr	2	' I hope this will go some way to making amends for my husband 's actions ' she said , and then took it back from him .
tr	0	Harley must then have had a revelation as he clamped his mouth tightly shut , started to shake his head back and forth , and whine .
tr	3	First they were furious that they hadn 't been called in for the ' kidnapping that never was ' , that was within their remit .
tr	4	As he pulled up Topsy and a crew swept in and a crane lifted the container off the flatbed trailer and lowered it gently to the ground .
tr	2	I had got away with it , ' only a couple of chicks Farnborough approach , will be overhead in three zero seconds out ' .
tr	2	Three consecutive cards and you win the trick ; four of a kind , or four in a row and you win the game ' .
tr	0	Natasha , in Arabella was hiding behind a hangar close to the end of the runway , along with Topsy and my ' bomb heads ' .
tr	2	' It looks as though it is Colitis ' , but she had scheduled Sasha in for an endoscopy tomorrow morning , just to confirm it .
tr	4	' Then ring him and tell him to come directly here , you can stay at El Campo ' , and handed her my phone .
tr	1	As I sat there watching her surging towards me , a visible bow wave forming in front of her , I metaphorically sprang into action .
tr	0	As I was transported gently to dry land , guess how many cameras came out of the woodwork , and where did all their images go ?
tr	4	Had she been your common or garden right handed male mechanic she would have been castrated and have two hernias before she had completed half the journey .
tr	3	I had only just arrived home but it was quite literally a flying visit , I was off on yet another jaunt , this time to Morocco .
tr	1	---------------------- John , my boss of aircraft maintenance had turned up unannounced at Robin 's home a week before I planned to return to Spain .
tr	4	He had required over thirty stitches , and the surgeons reckoned that even with cosmetic surgery he would still be scarred for the rest of his life .
tr	0	I had to have something more than just a watch and a pair of sunglasses to show for all the money that I was shelling out .
tr	3	Almost a hundred and fifty relatives arrived by Airbus the next morning , and spent the rest of the day with the aircraft and artefacts .
tr	2	He looked down at it and started to cry , I really , really was going to have to do something about my people skills .
tr	3	Then he got to the car bit , I just knew that he would , ' can 't you take a joke ' I said .
tr	3	As I was now a Dictator I didn 't take any questions , I just left them to their thoughts and made my way to my bedroom .
tr	2	Someone had spent a lot of time and money on this one , and she had a lovely clean bottom ( but back to the boat ) .
tr	3	Not on your Nelly I thought , although with the right colour sheets I imagined that the cabin could be made to look quite nice .
tr	3	Over our lunch I came clean about El Rincon , but told her that I still wasn 't going to let her off the babies .
tr	0	And when a fairly Senior Spanish Royal came over to say ' adios ' on his way out , was she impressed , or what .
tr	3	The only slight problem was that apparently Miss Antoinette was not for hire , so I thought a spot of the Michaels charm might do the trick .
tr	4	Normally I would have cowered away in fear , but what the hell I thought ; this must be Miss A , time for the charm offensive .
tr	0	He then leaned back against the wall , looked down at his legs , and was sick over what remained of his Giorgio Armani trousers .
tr	2	and from then on I apparently had round-the-clock care from every ' ist in the book , Nutritionists , Cardiologists , and Therapists of every persuasion .
tr	4	So far , we seem to be bent on overcoming and circumventing the walls which have kept all of nature 's creatures in balance and harmony .
tr	0	I sat in the cockpit of Surreal , cradling a mug of coffee and watching a blue heron on the far bank stalking its evening meal .
tr	4	I projected , if the wheels did indeed come off the wagon , it wouldn 't happen before 2030 , which gave me a comfortable margin .
tr	3	It wasn 't an easy decision , but I saw it as the only viable alternative to what could ultimately result in a horrible way to die .
tr	1	Sitting on the porch rocking away my life didn 't present an appealing option , and so I began to search for something a bit more challenging .
tr	3	Corporations and financial institutions have never been known for their altruism and morality yet they currently held sway over the vast majority of the world 's population .
tr	0	Such as flour which was already becoming scarce , spaghetti , macaroni , salt , sugar , powdered milk and lots and lots of coffee .
tr	0	Most blamed the government for its inaction and though Washington and Tallahassee tried nothing they could do had a favorable impact on the problems facing us .
tr	1	Soon , one faction began battling another for survival engulfing the whole of the continent in a frenzy of ethnic cleansing driven on by fear and starvation .
tr	1	Pakistan quickly joined in the fray declaring war on India who responded , in kind , throwing all her might against her troublesome Muslim neighbor .
tr	2	With all going on , tiny North Korea was shoved into the background , forgotten , and cut off from all aid including that of China .
tr	1	Now only a tiny fraction of the population was engaged in farming and for the vast majority , this avenue of subsistence no longer existed .
tr	1	I kept to the right , staying as far as possible from the docks on the opposite side , using binoculars to scan the bank .
tr	1	Skinny was right ; she was tied up six ways from Sunday , her wrists and ankles chafed and bleeding from her efforts to escape .
tr	0	She said , " The army came by four months ago and evacuated almost everybody to camps that 's the last outside news we had . "
tr	2	We went through about a dozen houses ; I found the bodies of a few old people I guessed had died from starvation or medical complications .
tr	1	Connie combed through closets trying on clothes as I checked out garages , cars , and boats for anything useful making a mental inventory as I went .
tr	1	I liberated them and noticed it was equipped with an Icom SSB ( single side band ) radio I took it along with the antenna and tuner .
tr	2	They were too heavy to haul on the bikes , but we had come across a white Ford diesel pickup which looked to be in good condition .
tr	0	Turns out it was , as instead of leisure time and a better life we got Wal-Mart and a nation of part-timers making minimum wage .
tr	4	With a small enlightened population , rich in technology , proceeding in an orderly manner we certainly would have reached some form of heaven . "
tr	3	To make a long story short , he told us , most of the survivors were situated in camps scattered along the southern Gulf Coast .
tr	4	I know , I 'm being selfish , but honestly , honey I never want to lose you or what we 've built together . "
tr	3	Then I heard a commotion in the water behind ; I turned , and not twenty feet away was a gigantic gator doing the death roll .
tr	0	Florida and California 's agriculture had been wiped out , and it was imperative to get farming in both states up and running as soon as possible .
tr	2	I looked over at Connie it would mean one of us would have to stay at the Glen and look after the crops and livestock .
tr	1	I don 't know where we can use you yet , but I 'll work on finding something interesting for you and your first mate . "
tr	1	I 'm so afraid now civilization is on the move again it 's only a matter of time before were caught up in it and torn apart .
tr	2	Connie got to her feet and said , " Come here you dear old man let this youngster give you some good old fashioned loving . "
tr	0	Commander Hunt asked Sam if he would act as a guide and show them around town as there was no one familiar with the area .
tr	2	George , This will help keep you on your toes until I can find you a command , all my best to you and Connie .
tr	4	If we 've learned anything , it 's to keep our numbers down to the point where we can 't have an adverse impact on nature .
tr	1	We sat on the front deck of the houseboat watching the Hunter gently swinging and tugging on her anchor rode looking once again like a sailboat .
tr	3	Connie and I discussed it , and we both came to an agreement to go but not without some trepidation at leaving our little world .
tr	3	We asked Jim and Cathy if they would consent to stay at the Glen and take over for us , they jumped at the opportunity .
tr	3	It would be a leisurely two-day trip , and we could partake of our time together without being thrust in amongst a bunch of passengers .
tr	1	My family 's remains ... I didn 't think it was going to affect me this much , but I can 't help shaking . "
tr	4	I removed the skull from the post , and with all the gentleness I could muster placed it next to the femur , and covered them up .
tr	0	As we approached the security barrier , a gray Navy launch appeared a voice on the radio said , " Captain Collins , please follow me . "
tr	3	Well , it turned out in the end you got it pretty much right , but I 'm sure you 're not reveling in your vindication .
tr	2	Hell people are still dying ; by the time it all is sorted out , they 'll probably be less than 50 million of us Americans left .
tr	3	Hell , I haven 't even thought about making policy , it was all the policy crap got us into this mess in the first place .
tr	4	" Look , you need some time to get settled in , if you like , I can arrange quarters for you and Connie . "
tr	1	GW , this is a pivotal point in human history , if there 's a chance of making a difference it 's worth a try .
tr	3	I feel like I 'm being swept along in a strong current the best thing , to do for now , is to go with the flow .
tr	4	Skipper , who had learned to pee over the lifelines like a pro , had been holding his bowels and was eagerly looking forward to dry land .
tr	3	I stood taking in the vista in front of me ; both of us stood transfixed staring as if seeing each other for the very first time .
tr	0	Allan looked over at Connie and said , " I was watching you young lady ; you 've got a sharp mind behind that pretty face .
tr	0	The Coast Guard , on the other hand , is a bastard child part of Homeland Security and already had a mandate to operate within the country .
tr	4	She said , " Don 't worry you 'll do fine , I 'll be right there rooting , just get up and knock em dead . "
tr	4	He began to devise his own theories of creation from the simple to the elaborate ; they acted as crutches helping early man deal with the unknown .
tr	4	" Evolution can be slowed but not stopped for along with spirituality there are other forces at work such as higher reasoning that drives mankind relentlessly forward .
tr	3	Then I thought what in the hell is the mission going to be , I 'm sure we 're not going to revisit the Titanic .
tr	3	The lowest rating aboard knew more about this boat than I did ; I quietly cursed Allan under my breath for getting me into this mess .
tr	3	We 're going to stay somewhat to the west run flat out and if my hunch is correct , we should make radar contact this afternoon .
tr	1	I took it as a polite way of telling Jim to get this damn pilgrim the hell off my bridge so I can get back to business .
tr	4	We broke for lunch , and afterward I turned in for a nap , this old guy wanted to be well rested if things got interesting .
tr	3	Rounds cut through the night toward the destroyer just as the first three-inch round went screaming over the cutter and landed a hundred yards away .
tr	4	Organize a party and have them stand by to take on hostile survivors , we 'll see if we can fish around for some answers .
tr	4	This is your day I 've taken up enough of your valuable time as it is , now get in there and dance with your bride . "
tr	4	Connie chided , " GW quit , every time we get close to leaving you start this crap , at times you can be such a pessimist .
tr	2	You should know he turned down the job of CO on a cutter and volunteered to be your second , just thought you 'd like to know .
tr	0	I said , " I am the man in charge , this isn 't a carrier so the normal chain of command rules are suspended .
tr	1	Jim you will take responsibility for the day to day running of the ship , I 'll only step in when I deem it necessary .
tr	1	Thirdly I like to know what the itinerary is going to be and how many are going along on the scientific part of this thing .
tr	2	I said , " Thank you both as I said your records speak for themselves and I 'm pleased to have you both on board .
tr	0	Herb said , " Captain , I 'll get that thing squared away tonight if I have to have Dan build us a new one from scratch .
tr	3	Things went better that morning with the gun Herb and Dan had burnt the midnight oil and had done some modifications it now seemed to work flawlessly .
tr	0	I would like you to make a pass by Grand Cayman on your way back to Key West that 's the plan as it stands now .
tr	3	I know it 's not the way you want to conduct research , but we just don 't have any idea what you 'll be up against .
tr	4	I hurried back so I could get Jim and Herb working on the details , it would keep them busy for the next couple of days .
tr	1	He said grinning , " Don 't worry Captain I 'll make it all go away , just don 't go peeking under any bunks . "
tr	3	Captain they might get their shit to work and leave happy , but the guns going to be as worthless as tits on a boar . "
tr	4	My Chief Engineer will take charge of camouflaging the gun , I would like to have the dome and its associated hardware removed from my ship . "
tr	3	At first I thought the note was a joke and I wrote bread and water three times a day until further notice and sent it back .
tr	4	Then I found out it wasn 't a joke and there wasn 't enough food on the ship to feed the crew and we were in port !
tr	2	The guy can run a stove all right , but no one told him when he came on board he was also responsible for provisioning .
tr	2	I 'd had enough time to cool down and part of my irritation was my own failing of not having caught the problem in the first place .
tr	2	I said , " I 'm not sorry for reaming you , I understand no one went over all the aspects of your job description .
tr	4	The frames were so light they could be taken apart and easily stored which was my intention and only to use them if we felt the need .
tr	4	I said , " Are you kidding we haven 't had meat in weeks that 's why we 're here today with bells on . "
tr	4	You did the right thing , I love solving problems at sunrise , and you 'll be delighted to learn I 've already worked out a solution .
tr	0	That 's what I liked about Allan Bright always ready with a brilliant answer and to ease the burden from the shoulders of his subordinates .
tr	3	Jim said , " That 's true both ships and women demand constant attention , go ahead Captain I 'll watch over this one for you . "
tr	4	We pulled into Key West Thetis , and Mohawk were both in port and we tied up behind them , Abe Gully was waiting to greet us .
tr	2	Hell , the Cubans , were so used to doing without for so long this was just another bump in the road for most of them .
tr	2	In about an hour , a boat rowed out with what looked to be a delegation of three civilians along with two armed men in uniform .
tr	4	A panel was put in place ; I was one of its members , we were elected so it wasn 't like we appointed ourselves .
tr	4	I want to do the research I came here for , and I fully expect to have the ships cooperation in order to carry it out . "
tr	1	" Oh yes , ask her she makes no bones about it , this isn 't the old days of don 't ask don 't tell . "
tr	4	They seemed to be a friendly couple and posed no threat , I asked Herb if we could round up some fishing tackle to give them .
tr	3	We can 't do anything tonight but make sure the ship is secure , Jim tell your guys to stay awake shoot first and ask questions later .
tr	1	What I thought was a white flag of truce was , in fact , a pair of ripped up panties with red writing apparently done in lipstick .
tr	4	God knows I don 't like them either , but once in a while I have to in order to protect the ship and crew .
tr	3	Jim pass the word , if anyone in that boat makes an attempt to go for a firearm sink the damn thing with the fifty . "
tr	4	I made the decision right then that before proceeding further I was going to set up a meeting with Fernando Vella and judge things for myself .
tr	2	" Yes Sir , I do like Ensign Jackson but not enough to put my job or the ship on the line for him . "
tr	2	You have my permission to go ashore whenever you choose and as I said it might turn out to be much ado about nothing . "
tr	3	Vella said , " Quite understandable Captain , I also find much of my time taken up by petty matters yet they must be attended to . "
tr	3	" Well , sir I rather not say directly they talked about certain of Mrs. Collins attributes ... Let 's just say they were flattering .
tr	3	I 'll be the first to say there 's a lot of risks involved , but that comes with the territory of being in the military .
tr	4	The rest of the day went quietly I let the scientific party go ashore and had Jeff escort them as he had done with us .
tr	0	Gerald and I made the trip to the old base ; Jeff was right there was a collection of rag-tag vessels from patrol boats to sailing yachts .
tr	0	I was hoping I hadn 't gone overboard and wondered what Allan would make of it , probably that I had finally gone around the bend .
tr	4	He said , " That may be true Captain , but you will have to make the decision on whether your wife lives or dies .
tr	4	I needed to buy some time and was hoping what I was about to do wasn 't going betray my ship and crew to meet his demands .
tr	4	Dan said it would take him anywhere from three days to a week in order to effect repairs and we decided to limp into Oranjestad .
tr	3	By this time the shore was just a little too far to attempt a swim and the current was carrying us away from the island .
tr	4	If the folks look friendly fine no problem , maybe we can find something to use our diesel in and make it back to the ship .
tr	4	We carefully kept to the shadows of vacant houses as we made our way through town until we reached the narrowest part of the point .
tr	2	Connie and Joyce wanted to go , but we said it was too risky , if something were to go wrong we would be caught for sure .
tr	3	Sam grabbed the M16 and sprayed the dory killing the one with the pistol and causing its other occupants to vote unanimously in favor of immediate retreat .
tr	4	After a quick reunion Sam pulled the anchor and placed the launch in tow , I turned the Whitby seaward and we said goodbye to Venezuela .
tr	4	I learned enough to know some of the vintages on this island were going for better than three hundred bucks a bottle before the Collapse .
tr	2	If I didn 't think , Sam would fall off the wagon completely I would have brought some of the best whiskey and rare Scotch on board .
tr	3	We hid the key to the vault along with the tips to the acetylene cutting torch as they were the only two ways to gain entry .
tr	0	Claude , we got separated from my ship almost a month ago in Aruba , is there any way I can contact them by short wave ? "
tr	0	I had a dilemma to iron out as I was technically the master of two vessels and was going to have to give one up .
tr	0	When I was a young man , each community had its own local bank ; you were on a first name basis with the manager and tellers .
tr	0	Many small banks had also taken a hit and credit for farmers no was longer just a matter of signing your name and a handshake .
tr	1	Its time we get back to making things and improving our infrastructure , Put the financial institutions to work building America instead of raping her .
tr	2	Our society is based on the principal of Capitalism and we hold up our free economy as a shining example for the world to follow .
tr	4	Those times are long gone , descent individuals no longer wish to serve in government and be exposed to muckraking , gridlock , and phony political correctness .
tr	1	Propaganda can be at its most insidious when it is watered down , slanted , and riddled with omissions until it becomes nothing but useless drivel .
tr	4	Much of the blame I believe can be assigned to the schools of journalism as they stress to their students to always present a neutral persona .
tr	3	We used to ask each other what the hells wrong with those guys why don 't they wake up , but it was all in vain .
tr	2	This will lead to further escalation of world instability as scarce commodities no longer flow freely creating turmoil and critical shortages of food and energy .
tr	4	Maybe it is due to the way they are educated , or maybe too much education , lack of common sense or just too much genius .
tr	3	This suggestion so infuriated the other senators that they dragged the poor unfortunate from the chamber and stoned him to death on the Senate steps .
tr	4	Therefore , we need to provide excellent vocational training , Germany excels in this area , and it would not hurt us to follow suit .
tr	1	As a dimensional inspector I worked with tolerances daily to me its means something within acceptable limits thus I transfer this meaning to my everyday life .
tr	4	Like everything in the human experience , we went first for the cheapest and most readily available sources to us at any given stage of our development .
tr	2	I 've raised enough corn in my life to know that taking food out our mouths to put in our tanks is a dead loser .
tr	4	America must be at the forefront of health care ; we need to take the lead instead of squandering our resources stubbornly maintaining the status quo .
tr	3	It is this moral compass that allows us to navigate through the troublesome situations of life and to ultimately do the right and just thing .
tr	3	It is rather promulgated in an informal style to introduce an idea to any interested parties and to relate a rather unorthodox perspective on the human condition .
tr	1	I began by discarding and dismissing all the daily activities and jumbled affairs of man liking it to the activity within a beehive or ant colony .
tr	3	It was then that I began to wonder if nature hadn 't evolved humans as an accessory in this quest to overcome her own limitations .
tr	3	Big and ferocious creatures weren 't going to be the answer , history had shown that they instantly turned into crispy critters or starved to death .
tr	2	She hasn 't missed a trick even going so far as to push us into creating our own myriad of problems that we are forced to confront .
tr	4	Our species is still filled with hubris and continues to blindly take all the credit , boasting we have overcome , tamed , and beaten Nature .
tr	1	He was in his sixties , by now extremely old by Dayak standards , his face a mass of wrinkles around his now toothless mouth .
tr	2	" Do not spend all day arguing you two , " she called up , " you have things to do today before leaving tomorrow . "
tr	4	The next few RPG rounds walked down the length of the Longhouse killing most of the clan before any sort of defense could be organized .
tr	1	" Morning Paddy , what are you still doing here Jennings , tea on yet , anything happen during the night we need to know about ?
tr	0	Captain Mason stood in the doorway , an averagely tall career soldier , developing a bit of a paunch which he felt obliged to suck in .
tr	0	a career soldier , a quiet spoken man given to almost whispering ... ... a jungle habit , a hard man , a ' Team ' man .
tr	4	You have to stay off the tracks , the ridges , the rivers , as you know ; otherwise we 'd never get out of there alive .
tr	3	" If we can get the scouts to better identify the location and it 's within range of the Whirlwind we could rope you in .
tr	0	Ron Gurney , Lieutenant Colonel , late of the Brigade of Guards , Officer Commanding ' A ' squadron calling from Labuan far to the east .
tr	4	Start getting your kit together and be prepared to leave the day after tomorrow but , like I said , leave all the options open .
tr	3	" You know I 'm glad I didn 't take the posting to Labuan there 's nothing too much wrong with this beach , " he said .
tr	4	It can keep me , it can feed me , it can help me and yes it can hide and protect me if that is my need .
tr	0	" Not too far chaps , about an hour and a half in the air , watch for the lights , red in the door ... ... .
tr	3	For the first time in two hours he took a drink of the tepid water in his water bottle and beat the flies off his face .
tr	3	Working their way through the rice , now turning brown in the heat , George notice the glint of something in the dust ... . .
tr	3	" Typical Hereford weather , " he muttered to himself , " never know what 's it 's going to do until it actually does it . "
tr	4	Of course that was before he got detached and sent back to Bradbury Lines to take on some of the training of wannabe SAS troopers .
tr	3	Not that he 'd had too much opportunity when he 'd first arrived the training being probably the toughest of any military unit in the world .
tr	4	He was thankful that , in the main , they had been able to keep together through their careers though now retired and in civilian life .
tr	1	It applied in the bush , it certainly applies on the golf course and I guess it applies in business too , " said George thoughtfully .
tr	3	Tony sat in the men 's club in Kensington eying his well manicured nails while putting a match to the cigar the waiter had just brought him .
tr	1	The business was successful although , as he was quick to say , it was a function of the effort he 'd put in rather than luck .
tr	0	" It 's a three day event , " said Dick , " a golf tournament , a dinner come social and a visit to Bradbury Lines .
tr	3	She stood up smoothly and , first stripping to the waist as was required , began the basic yet difficult motions of the basic Silat .
tr	1	" Should be OK , " Avi said , trying not to raise his voice over the increasing noise in the bar , " same price ? "
tr	2	" Just like her , " he thought , " throwing a bloody damper on something I 've been looking forward to for weeks . "
tr	1	" You haven 't changed one little bit , " said Paddy , " and you 're still Irish , " said Gema , outwardly smiling .
tr	2	" Well you 'll be able to rest up over the next couple of days , golf tomorrow then over to the barracks on Sunday .
tr	3	The trip had gone without a hitch apparently , although they might have to do something about better ventilation for the space below the truck bed .
tr	1	Something 's going on which might need your specific skills but let there be no misunderstanding , I can 't protect you if it all goes sideways .
tr	3	" It 's getting late in the day , let 's go for a pint and I 'll fill you in , how about it ? "
tr	1	" Hi Dickie , " she said quite softly , " I have a few things I 'd like to talk about if you don 't mind .
tr	2	Parking in front of the Georgian portico the front door opened and the two labs came tearing out both wearing red scarves followed by George Mudd .
tr	4	He didn 't answer the phone , it was an Inspector with the West Yorkshire Police , he told me Peter had been killed ! "
tr	4	He explained the situation to the Commander and requested all the information be acquired from the West Yorks and forwarded to the office in Hereford .
tr	2	" No one really knows what the shelf life is only that as long as the sugar content is not boiled off the poison is fatal .
tr	2	Save you the trouble of coming up to London and I could do with a bit of a break , anywhere decent to stay ? "
tr	0	said Paddy , " we can talk in the car , as long as I 'm back at Tern Hill by 2300 hours I 'll be OK .
tr	3	" You 've got to be kidding , " said Paddy , " how the hell are we supposed to do that without getting nicked ? "
tr	4	" Jesus Christ we follow them all over God 's half acre , then they meet and we still don 't know what they 're up to .
tr	1	" He was fine with it Sir , " said David , " luckily he 's military so I really didn 't have to explain anything .
tr	0	It was a bright clear day , for a change , without any rain in the forecast ... ... although you can never be sure .
tr	3	He gently powered the car through a roundabout , without hardly lifting his foot off the accelerator , listening to the snarl left in their wake .
tr	3	" It is but you 'll get the hang of it pretty quick I think , " he replied as they walked back out the car .
tr	2	" Thought I heard your car , " he said , " come on in I just heard from one of my chaps in Belfast . "
tr	2	The room was huge echoing back to when it was truly the manor house , two large dog mats off to one side flanked by dog bowls .
tr	0	Jennie was at least five inches taller than Gema her freckles and auburn hair in total contrast to Gema 's Eurasian looks and dark lustrous hair .
tr	0	" Probably nothing really , " she answered , " just that McElroy was part of the original group and two of them are dead now .
tr	3	He was wearing old track suit bottoms , a tee shirt with 1st Para printed on the front and technical looking runners on his feet .
tr	1	It still goes on you know , admittedly in a small way but the traditional Iban living in the jungle still believe in the spirit world .
tr	3	They cut down a tree that was , of course , far too big , got the tractor and towed it to the front door .
tr	0	It was getting bloody cold as the year headed towards Christmas and standing around on somebody 's front step was not her idea of pleasure .
tr	3	Couldn 't or wouldn 't thought Jennie , things just didn 't seem quite right here but she couldn 't put a finger on it .
tr	1	" Doesn 't surprise me , " said George , " what I am surprised about is that it lasted as long as it did . "
tr	2	Nowhere near as many produce stalls , which was hardly surprising , still plenty of people though , braving the cold and manning stalls of all types .
tr	2	" Thought so , " said David , " he fancied you right from the get go you know , you could see that . "
tr	3	I would have had at least two of them on the base during the night and I would have picked the same time of night to attack .
tr	4	" It should be obvious , even to you John , that we 've brought you here for a little chat , " he smiled again .
tr	2	He offered a ' good morning ' as the runner went by but got no response which was unusual for this part of the world .
tr	2	I 'm going to talk to him as soon as I can find him , simply have your people hand off to him and his people .
tr	2	" No problem Commander , " said George , " tell the pilot to pick you up in the paddock to the south of the house .
tr	2	Soon as I 've done that we 'll drive over to the Command and Control Center and get a closer look at the Brixton Operation .
tr	4	They settled down to wait , periodically checking with the teams and the two snipers on the roofs , having excellent views of the streets .
tr	1	We won 't have any trouble figuring out Avi 's involvement in this and the illegals will be deported quickly to their country of origin ... ... .
tr	2	She could see Robbie and George coming down the path out of the woods together with the two labs like two black blobs in the snow .
tr	2	" That really big box is for you George , " said Jennie , " took two of us to get it in here . "
tr	4	" I don 't wear them to bed any more , " she murmured turning towards him , feeling him against her stomach ... ... .
tr	4	she 's beautiful , can cook and can fix tickets when you get nicked for speeding , what more could a man possibly want ? "
tr	2	I 'm going to walk down to the Lodge , give the dogs a bit of air too , why don 't you come with me . "
tr	3	Later that day , the weak sun doing nothing to melt the snow , George suggested to Jennie that they go for a little drive .
tr	3	It 's important to me that you meet her , that you understand she was a major part of my life for a long time .
tr	0	Facing them across the hallway a matronly , middle aged woman , hair in a bun , sat behind a desk her hands conspicuously out of sight .
tr	1	" I knew about it , " said David , " and I agree with George ... ... it 's all too weird just now . "
tr	4	" I already have had the pleasure of meeting George , " he said , " he 's a good golfer as I recollect . "
tr	3	Taking the empty magazine and a box of 9 mill hollow points he went back down to the study and thoughtfully poured himself a drink .
tr	1	George stood there the memories running through his mind like a fast forwarded film , Malaya , Sarawak , Bradbury Lines , Harry , Peter ... . .
tr	4	" I spoke to another of my guys who tells me that the arrangements concerning the proposed patrols in the south are not going very well .
tr	2	" I 've got some bad news for you Robbie , " he said quietly , " Dick Mason shot himself ... ... looks that way anyway .
tr	3	She had gotten used to the guards , in their white camo , that George insisted stay around until some sort of conclusion was arrived at .
tr	4	For the time being I want you take the surveillance off Jennie and keep an eye on Gema Mason ... you know where she lives .
tr	3	I guided them , I taught them to be patient , taught them to be quiet , taught them how to survive in my land . "
tr	4	~ ~ ~ Chapter 34 The Interview March in England is not the greatest of months no matter where you are and Hereford is no exception .
tr	4	I think at this time , in order to clear the air and put things into perspective so to speak we should properly introduce ourselves .
tr	2	" Mrs. Mason I warned you yesterday about being evasive now I 'm warning you about your lack of cooperation and how that might be viewed . "
tr	1	" It 's a wonder you can get anyone to say anything in there , " said George , " it 's so damned Dickensian .
tr	3	Don 't really know why I didn 't think of it back at the station ... ... ... better late than never I suppose . "
tr	2	" A few hours I think George , it 's going to take a couple of days for us to go through the whole damn place . "
tr	3	George sat quietly , hands clasped lightly in front of him on the table , fighting an awareness that he didn 't want to admit .
tr	2	" You don 't have to worry about Robbie or myself , " said George , " my own people are taking care of that .
tr	4	" That 's affirmative , " said George , " she 'll be heading towards the daughter 's flat in the West End , stay with her .
tr	2	After half a dozen stops she got off , waved down a passing cab and set off for the Holiday Inn over by Oxford Circus .
tr	2	In a blur of action Mrs. Thompson was down behind the desk and Robert was sliding down the wall a look of surprise on his face .
tr	4	Robbie had seen the surveillance tapes and was as amazed as the rest of them ... perhaps more so because of his previous relationship with Gema .
tr	4	" I thought I knew her , " whispered Robbie , " off and on I 've helped her and her girl for twenty five years .
tr	3	Now in the Fiesta she headed West on the North Circular to pick up the M40 that would take her to Banbury and finally to Chipping Norton .
tr	1	" I think I 'm going to find that just being a copper in Hereford is going to be a bit boring now , " she said .
tr	3	" Too much of that Bowmore , " he thought , " I either get myself in shape or start to recognize my limitations . "
tr	4	Rounding the corner he saw Robbie lying motionless in the middle of the trail and a tall figure just standing there looking down at the body .
tr	1	It was the first time I saw her openly speaking to an older man as she did to the giant sailor , with such familiarity .
tr	0	Now he walked as if he were in pain , sounding out of breath and speaking as if it gave him great pain to talk .
tr	2	She looked at her husband and then at Jean , who was very pale , drops of blood forming a pool at his booted foot .
tr	3	It was hard to watch her , yet she had this strength in her that made her to stand up and go on , no matter what .
tr	0	" Because I am the captain and this is my ship , " He said nonchalantly and placed a slice of fruit in his mouth .
tr	3	It did not take much convincing to sway the Falcon so that Roberto could go and ensure that Cisco met the demands for the ransom .
tr	4	Once done , she relaxed , holding the glass of water in her hands , not letting go of the precious fluid , taking frequent sips .
tr	0	In her young mind she did not know of the trouble she had caused him , only that she had a longing for a father figure .
tr	3	For so long he had suppressed thoughts like that , but he thought about it more and more often , enjoying the comfort it brought to him .
tr	4	Hazelnut eyes met ochre ones and for a few seconds they just locked before she answered , her eyes revealing her shock at the invitation .
tr	2	We are going to India to meet one of our ships and escort it back to Portugal , " Roberto replied in a confident voice .
tr	4	They watched the men very carefully as they descended the Jacob 's ladder , entered their long boat , and rowed back to their ship .
tr	4	She was like a feather on his shoulder , so he could easily manoeuvre up the stairs and through the sleeping men without making a sound .
tr	0	" There is no way that I will allow you to go on that ship again , " said Roberto abruptly , glaring at her .
tr	4	Her heart pounded in her chest and she was sure one would notice the rapid beat but her cleavage was of greater concern to them .
tr	4	She smiled sweetly up at him , keeping the Captain 's attention as the two figures emerged on deck and slipped over the railing in record time .
tr	2	On one occasion she saw Roberto 's strictness with a man who was lazy on the job , but he still managed to be kind to him .
tr	2	Roberto followed him as he ran down the steps to the lower deck right into the arms of the doctor who was on his way up .
tr	4	She did not want to let him know about her concerns and she pushed him away , her breath swallow as she tried to gather her wits .
tr	0	" Please , Roberto , tell me so that I can understand , " she said again , encouraging him after handing him his plate .
tr	3	When I heard about it two days later , I was bitter and full of rage , seeking the man that had done this to her .
tr	4	" The Falcon was so impressed with me that he took me under his wing and taught me everything I know about sailing and piracy .
tr	3	" You had an interesting life , Roberto , and it is true what my father said , you cannot judge a book by its cover . "
tr	0	She caressed him softly , tracing the shoulder blades with her hand , his skin soft but muscles hard , his breathing rhythmic against her .
tr	0	He held her tight ; laid his head on her back , running his hands over her , and let them rest on her with delight .
tr	3	Tiny was , as his name stated , tiny , but with a sure hand that could impale a fly with one quick throw with his daggers .
tr	2	" Slow down , friend , your time will come , " he spoke softly into his ear , holding him back at his shoulder .
tr	0	It was expected of him as the son of the Falcon , but he was furious with himself for what she had just been through .
tr	1	19 It took him awhile to sleep again , with his pregnant wife in his arms , just holding her as if his life depended on it .
tr	4	Kissing her softly , he smiled when she sighed in his arms , deep in sleep , cuddling into him , her body draped over him .
tr	0	Again , she put on her brother 's clothing and when Roberto looked at her with dismay , she shrugged her shoulders without saying a word .
tr	0	She protected her face with her sword , pushing him away from her with both hands , and then she attacked without uttering a word .
tr	4	She shivered from cold and weariness and he gathered her closer , supplying her with much-needed warmth , feeling the fear and tension leaving her body .
tr	3	Roberto stayed and gathered all the evidence for the Falcon 's day in court , but it took a lady to bring him down . "
tr	0	The life of a sea captain was hard and lonely for any man , but when a loving wife waits , it makes it all worthwhile .
tr	4	Nora was the daughter of a Dutch landowner , and they went to ask for permission for their marriage before they would set sail to France .
tr	3	He knew this was stupid to think like this but he could not help it and the dread came out as a hoarse , croaking sound .
tr	3	All she was comfortable in was Roberto 's shirts , but that meant she could not go out , which was frustrating in the stifling cabin .
tr	0	Neither man made any move to speak as Rafe set his seal to the wax , and leant his tall frame back in the chair .
tr	2	There was nothing that his men would not do for Lord Rafe , and in return there was nothing Lord Rafe would not do for his men .
tr	3	There was something else too , so foreign to his master 's nature , that for a moment he could not put a name to it .
tr	2	" For the sake of my father I cannot refuse to marry her , for the sake of my own honour I could not beg off .
tr	0	He was aware of the very high regard in which Lord Rafe held his father , the implicit trust that he put in his father 's wisdom .
tr	3	Rafe waited , his complete stillness hiding a certain impatient restlessness that , though very much a part of his character , he always sought to control .
tr	4	It was not her place to question her employer , but she found herself disliking the slights that she perceived Lord Rafe to be offering Adele .
tr	4	" Lady Adele ... " " She will be of no use to anyone , least of all to her husband , " interrupted Rafe .
tr	4	Lady Adele did not feel disgruntled ; she had not taken offence at Lord Rafe 's refusal to escort her to his home in person .
tr	0	She knew him to be thoughtful for the things he had sent her had been chosen with the utmost care that they might delight her .
tr	3	As he moved from standing to sitting position for perhaps the hundredth time , it occurred to him that he wasn 't handling the situation very well .
tr	0	He was a well looking man , Adele conceded , and in his favour he lacked the customary arrogant pride that came with such handsome looks .
tr	1	She was so startled by his thorough , almost rude , inspection of her , that all she could do was stare up at him blankly .
tr	0	He had not expected anything else from Adele ; she was probably crying as much out of fear as for the actual pain of parting .
tr	4	Gradually she relaxed as Rafe took the rein and led them through the fort 's gates and down the steep track that stretched down the hill .
tr	4	Adele was grateful for the care with which he had set her down , for her feet were numbed with cold and even standing was uncomfortable .
tr	4	He was , she could see , enjoying the task and , in return , the chore seemed to be melting the tension from him .
tr	4	" I have spent much of my life in army camps , I cannot begin to tell you the wonder a proper bed holds for me ! "
tr	0	He didn 't tell them that it was there that his father had found him , so many hours later , as dusk had approached .
tr	0	He had realised it was a waste that would continue , an awful rite of war that would take place again , over and over .
tr	3	He could wait until the fire had burnt down to embers , but there was no saying that the shadowy assailants would wait that long to attack .
tr	4	He wished to wake her up slowly so he could alert her to their predicament , not jerk her from sleep with a betraying start .
tr	2	Rafe watched her , not out of admiration , although she did look appealing ensconced in the mossy bower , but with a kind of approval .
tr	0	Though he was not as handsome as Lord Rafe was held to be , his friendly face and ready humour made him just as popular .
tr	3	She had thought that the whole point of her training at the fort was that she might conform to the idea of a proper wife .
tr	1	The light shower soon turned into a heavy downpour , soaking his head and shoulders and running down his neck , uncomfortable and icy cold .
tr	0	Even as she spoke she made a grab for the tree nearest to her , falling against it and wrapping both arms around its narrow trunk .
tr	3	It was unfortunate that the wind was blowing the rain against them , flinging gusts of ice cold droplets over them with the force of hailstones .
tr	4	Rand pulled his cloak around him more securely , seeking to eliminate the cause of the draught that had slipped its cold fingers through his covering .
tr	4	Finan was no fool , he knew how it felt to be manipulated , and his hesitation disappeared to be replaced by iron hard cynicism .
tr	2	He had more friends than he knew what to do with , and the ladies of the court found him to be the most amusing of companions .
tr	3	It was still raining but not as hard as it had been , the water fell from the skies in a swirling mist about them .
tr	3	" He taught me to use the bow and the sword , and how to use a person 's strength against them in a struggle . "
tr	4	I dare say if it had not been for our betrothal he might have been married long ago and would even now have children . "
tr	4	He had never wished to marry another , and he had been pleased to use her as a shield against the political alliances formed by marriage .
tr	4	Rafe was not sure he enjoyed being teased , but it was very hard to be angry with Adele when she was shaking with irresistible laughter .
tr	1	" I should think I might have looked horrified ; I am not sure I am old enough to participate in such a discussion . "
tr	4	He had needed to see this warrior that he was following , and had known that he would not be able to rest until he had .
tr	0	This need had drawn him from the warmth of his furs , and through the damp darkness , to stand watching in the shadows of the forest .
tr	3	" I would not go so far as that , but my temper is easy ; it has to be with Rafe coiled so tight . "
tr	4	He looked up to find Adele 's eyes upon him , they did not question or rebuke him for failing to answer Eda 's question .
tr	0	She felt as though there was so much that he hid from her , so much of himself that he withheld and kept in reserve .
tr	3	" I thought that we were supposed to be starting out early and hastening to cover this next part of our journey as quickly as possible ? "
tr	4	Eda continued to gaze at Rafe , her head a little to one side , a look in her eyes that he could not quite make out .
tr	4	She had been an unnecessary bother to him , one who had the unfortunate habit of calling into question his every action , which annoyed him greatly .
tr	0	A raiding party from Mercia could well have come upon them and two such beautiful prizes would be a temptation that was hard to resist .
tr	3	And what of those who had been following them from the start , waiting , for all he knew , for just such a moment as this ?
tr	0	It lost its significance ; it was no longer a way to end the wrong , but became a further degradation to make us appear weak .
tr	3	His master would be better investing his time elsewhere , with some pretty little maid who thought that the sun rose and set at his command .
tr	1	" This is completely ridiculous : I have not the faintest notion where we are , I am so tired I can hardly sit upright .
tr	3	Just think ; if we rest , just for a little while , we could wait until morning and try to think of some plan . "
tr	4	They owed him their lives twice over , and it was a circumstance that she was determined to make Lord Rafe and everyone else aware of .
tr	2	Finan took the reins from the boy who held his horse and swung up onto its back , giving the command to get under way .
tr	3	Though no sound was made , the intelligence that an altercation was taking place on the outskirts of the camp soon became known to those within .
tr	4	" No , Adele , please , not the ear ... " Adele dropped her hold on him , the movement betraying her distaste and fury .
tr	0	" That would mean that Lady Adele would be present , and I do not think ... " Rafe slapped a hand to his head .
tr	2	" That first night you camped , if it had not been for our rescuing you from your assailants , you would have fallen . "
tr	2	" Words , I have no doubt , that have been echoed in some form or other , kingdoms over , " replied Lord Brogan .
tr	4	Very well ; if he will be so insolent as to try and force my hand , he can ferret out these things himself . "
tr	0	His mount , a large chestnut , showed why his master had named him Brute by kicking and biting any and all in his reach .
tr	0	For a time they remained still , and then Rafe turned to her with an air of a man who had something unpleasant to accomplish .
tr	3	That had been the first wild thought to enter her head , that something so perfectly accommodating to her happiness must surely not be real .
tr	3	Rafe wished to goodness that she hadn 't taken that stance , better if she had asked him to tell her all than to push him away .
tr	0	Alarmed at what must have occurred to cause Adele such distress , and angry that Finn , after wreaking such havoc , had simply walked away .
tr	2	" Drogo becomes increasingly worried ; he does not say anything , but I think he is at a loss to know what more to do . "
tr	3	He could feel the trap closing , forcing the truth into his throat where at any moment it would spill as words from his lips .
tr	1	Nothing could have been more effective in impressing upon him his stupidity , than making him watch the pain his own thoughtless actions had inflicted upon another .
tr	4	He found that he liked the way she paused before she spoke , her eyes softly unfocused as she collected her thoughts before uttering a word .
tr	4	Her eyes had travelled Rand 's face , soft and dreamy , as though she was seeking to imprint his every feature on her memory .
tr	4	Yet here he was , completely willing to throw his pride into the mud to be trampled upon just so long as he could keep Adele .
tr	1	It was on the tip of Finan 's tongue to deny it , purely on principle , but his stomach overruled his brain and he nodded .
tr	3	On any day at court Rafe would be found at the king 's side , discussing the things that were close to the king 's heart .
tr	3	Rafe shuddered ; it wasn 't the intent that unsettled him so horribly , it was the fact that he had been blind to it .
tr	4	" I have a wish to see how this thing turns out , therefore know that there is peace between us until it is over . "
tr	0	I will not sit by and watch as another madman rips this kingdom apart ; even if preventing him means taking you as an ally . "
tr	3	" But I did not know ... I never thought that he ... your family ... " Adele smoothed back the hair that fell over his brow .
tr	2	She sneaked a look across at him , wondering why he had sought her out , and was disconcerted to find him looking at her .
tr	2	" I hope that you will be happy with Rand , " he continued with difficultly , oblivious to the look of consternation on Adele 's face .
tr	0	He had always known that her expression hid much , but he was constantly surprised by the sharp and downright devious way her mind worked .
tr	4	Rafe couldn 't think how he had not noticed the door before , and then saw that it had been covered by a large tapestry .
tr	3	He took Eda 's hand , but started away from him in surprise , trying to extricate herself , but his grip was too strong .
tr	4	He stopped a few yards into the trees and released her , keeping a few feet distance between them , and turned his back upon her .
tr	4	Lord Brogan reflected that , unless his son had developed an uncharacteristic interest in fauna , the quarters must have been delivered over to the ladies .
tr	4	There was something uncanny about the way he could lull a person into a false sense of security , only to destroy them with a single blow .
tr	0	Lord Brogan took a look at her face and saw that , although her gaze was unfocused and innocent , she was closed and guarded against him .
tr	0	Lord Brogan hid a smile ; it seemed that Rafe was not so backward in the matters of a man and a maid as he had supposed .
tr	3	There is nothing that will be said in this room that you cannot hear , Adele , nothing that I wish hidden from you . "
tr	4	Adele 's soft gaze rested on him for a moment before she nodded , a slight smile lightening her face as she relaxed back into his embrace .
tr	1	Even a king has limitations to his power ; he must rely on his lords ' allegiance to him to keep his kingdom and his kingship safe .
tr	1	If his lords ' do not find his rule pleasing , then they will remove the kingship from him and give it to another . "
tr	2	You are a son to take pride in Rafe and I am proud of you , more so in this moment than I can express . "
tr	0	It wasn 't a boat ride or a trip in a hot air balloon , which frankly are probably highly overrated and a bit cheesy .
tr	4	He waited for his sentence , but his flushed face told me he was thinking , hoping that I 'd come back and kiss him .
tr	3	This whole courtroom drama might be a joke , but inside , I was a bit hurt that this date wasn 't really a date .
tr	4	I lifted the bloom to my nose and let the soft petals brush against my skin , the sweet smell giving me a false sense of security .
tr	1	His big round belly puffed into me , knocking me back , and his long , curly grey beard had bits of frosting stuck in it .
tr	3	When I tried to talk about the shooting and that I didn 't know if he was dead or alive , my throat closed up .
tr	2	Before she could let go of my hands , I babbled out some words , sounding like a nervous twelve-year-old about to give an oral report .
tr	0	I shoved handful after handful of money back into the package , grabbed the camera and the note , and sprinted back to my room .
tr	2	I wanted to pin him to the floor and hold a butter knife to his neck until he took our problems , my problems , seriously .
tr	0	He could grow a twirly mustache and wear a beret , and I could whisper Je t ' aime and forget about all of this .
tr	1	I stayed in my flannel nightgown , which I 'd dug out of the bottom of my dresser after walking in on Malcolm in my kitchen .
tr	1	I drank in the sight of him , his quirky smile and the familiar glint in his eye like he knew something I didn 't .
tr	4	He had to be just fooling around , but still , I felt annoyed that he could joke when I could barely crack a smile .
tr	3	I wanted to ask him what to do next , beg him to sit down and brainstorm with me , but the words wouldn 't come .
tr	0	Mysteries swirled around me as if all I needed to do was reach out and catch the answer like it was a leaf on a windy day .
tr	0	I should whip out my camera and snap his picture , but my cupcakes were already in danger of slipping and crashing to the ground .
tr	2	He burst out with a jovial laugh , and I swear his belly jiggled like a bowl full of my dad 's homemade grape jelly .
tr	2	Every older female who walked past with longish brown hair wearing a scarf or a hat , I hoped would signal for me to follow .
tr	3	One voice stood out in particular , a voice that I 'd grown accustomed to , one that had nudged its way into my heart .
tr	3	But if I didn 't act normal , he might suspect I knew and then ... what if they sent someone to snuff me out early ?
tr	2	He was too good to leave information about my family exposed or to leave a picture of Jolie 's prisoner under a magnet on his fridge .
tr	1	I 'm supposed to be spying on you , but I 'm pretending in order to gain his trust and figure out if he has Aimee . "
tr	3	But he grabbed my foot and with a twist that sent pain shooting up my leg , he pushed me into the house and slammed the door .
tr	4	When she 'd disappeared , I 'd partly blamed myself for not asking more questions and digging into her life more , like a friend should .
tr	3	I tiptoed through it , terrified with each step that a rat would run over my feet or worse I 'd bump into a skeleton or something .
tr	1	I mean it 's not like you can practice that kind of thing in daylight without someone suspecting you had a prisoner locked in your basement .
tr	1	With every step , the muscles in my back sent shooting pain up my spine in anticipation of a hand about to clamp down on my neck .
tr	2	But you had no right to lead me on , to act like you cared , to become my friend , to kiss me . "
tr	1	I 'd been playing the game wrong , boldly stepping into this chaotic mess like I had a right , like I was immune to getting hurt .
tr	0	An hour later , with a black scarf wrapped around my neck and wearing dark , inconspicuous clothing , I studied Peyton 's apartment building .
tr	0	I wanted to sprint forward and pull them all back , let them know that Spy Games had turned dangerous -- as in life-or-death dangerous .
tr	0	One group , led by a tall man with silver hair -- another wannabe -- arrogantly pushed his way past the reporters and through the jockeying crowd .
tr	3	I swallowed what little spit was in my mouth and tried to find the courage to tell Jolie he was in a lot of trouble .
tr	3	To my right at the perimeter of the contest , Malcolm moved closer to us , slipping in and out of the crowd like a stealthy predator .
tr	3	It turned out to be trash but it looked suspicious and we 'd just had a bomb threat at school so I had bomb on the brain .
tr	0	I didn 't look back once because Jules and I had made a pact that if one got caught , the other wouldn 't squeal .
tr	4	Scott picked up the rest of the trash and threw it in the middle barrel then dropped the lid back onto it before snapping the clamps closed .
tr	3	" I 'm going go up and clear away that brush on the west slope so we can get in there with the trucks tomorrow . "
tr	4	When the bear rose up on its hind legs again Scott saw it dig into the drum as the white image disappeared behind the steel barrel .
tr	3	" I sat here and watched that bear bounce its front paws up and down on the lid of that drum until it gave way .
tr	4	Scott 's eyes widened as the bear glared at him and he heard a low , throaty growl erupt from deep in the bear 's throat .
tr	3	" There 's no record of a child being lost that wasn 't found in this section of the Sierras for the last thirty years .
tr	0	" All I can think of is just keep making sure that she gets good food and doesn 't have to dig in garbage cans anymore .
tr	3	Scott nodded as he watched the road for any wildlife , something that was quite prevalent at this time of night in the dense forests .
tr	0	He was about to start backing away when a rustling sound hit his ears and moments later , a white image appeared beside the bear .
tr	4	He heard the bear make a low , growling sound and saw the little girl look at the bear then make a higher pitched throaty sound .
tr	4	Its paw was mangled where the trap had latched onto it and most likely where the coyote had been chewing at it to try to get free .
tr	4	He smiled when she got to her feet and came toward him and he stepped aside instead of offering to help her to the ground .
tr	4	The little girl seemed to survey the situation then looked back over her shoulder at the black bear who was still standing in the same place .
tr	0	Scott blinked his gaze to the animal 's paw , saw the place he had bandaged then saw a smile touch the little girl 's mouth again .
tr	3	Her smile was instant and she looked back at the two animals , emitted a gurgling cry then watched both of them come forward at a trot .
tr	4	He knew there was a secondary road that was used by the forest service at the top of the second ridge and knew it led east .
tr	4	As they moved along the bottom of the gorge he watched Sidney go from rock to rock and realized she had done this many times .
tr	3	Scott considered ways of getting the bones out of the gorge but there was no way of doing that now or maybe ever , without disturbing them .
tr	3	Sincerely , John Williams , Attorney at Law ' Scott sighed and folded the letter and slid it under the growing stack in his right hand .
tr	1	She would not understand that her Mommy and Daddy cannot go on any longer , facing one strife after another with no end in sight .
tr	2	" Doug 's going to bring down those logs from the south slope , " he informed as he watched Steve pour two cups of coffee .
tr	4	It was rare for her to step in anything that even closely resembled mud and spent most of her time laying on the porch waiting for Sidney .
tr	3	That 's when my paperwork doubles and stays that way till they either settle down to country life or go back to their big cities . "
tr	4	Their new four by four , which they had purchased the previous winter , was a Dodge with a huge hemi engine under the hood .
tr	3	I 'm going to turn on the yard lights , " she told her brother and went through a nearby door and into the kitchen .
tr	3	Chapter 10 The next morning , just after six , Scott strolled into the kitchen to see Sidney sitting at the table drinking a cup of coffee .
tr	4	Before Scott could tell him he had found one of them , he heard a piercing , howling cry that seemed to reverberate across the hills .
tr	2	When the sheriff had come over and told him that Scott and Sidney Lyndon had decided not to file a complaint he had tried to play dumb .
tr	3	You stole it from them then had the gall to kill them when they couldn 't survive on what you had left for them . "
tr	3	You had to come out to their land , you had to spread out and take over the countryside , taking away what was theirs . "
tr	3	Scott smiled and took the pup and the bottle and after laying the pup across his legs , leveled the bottle at the gaping mouth .
tr	2	No part of this book may be stored , reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means without express written permission of the author .
tr	2	It was a dream room for any young girl , and the layout was mirrored on the other side of a shared bathroom for Jessie 's room .
tr	4	Nothing but tiled floor demarcated the area called the kitchen , wood floors defined the dining and living rooms , and stone distinguished the entry .
tr	2	If I didn 't want to , I wouldn 't do it and I wouldn 't worry about whether or not you approved of it . "
tr	4	Anna came out of her room , still in her nightshirt , as he was cracking the second egg , her timing impeccable as usual .
tr	3	Chapter 4 -- An Interesting Assignment Both arms came out of the water at her hips as her legs thrust her almost completely into the air .
tr	4	Chelsea walked across the street to the high school ; Alex rushed into the junior high , the first bell ringing just as she entered .
tr	1	Mr. Anderson grinned broadly , enjoying their sudden enthusiasm in history as they all walked past him , smiling and talking about the great Roman Empire .
tr	3	She ran across the ground barefoot and sat down to put on her shoes just in time to join the other girls in warm-up stretches .
tr	3	And the way I see it , that 's just enough to ensure victory , which is what I 'm supposed to do , right ? "
tr	3	He was at his limit as well , but the technique was what he was teaching so it didn 't matter to him at all .
tr	3	Out of eight girls in their age group , she was still in the bottom half for all strokes , but was moving up steadily .
tr	0	" I suggest you at least do a 100 or you 'll be a slacker and your mom may put you back in ballet ! "
tr	4	Alex grabbed the cube from her with a suspicious look and cradled it under her arm , as if protecting it from an evil enemy .
tr	3	All were barefoot with nothing but tattered rags for the mother , a loin cloth for the children , " is most likely lower class . "
tr	2	But , this thing is obviously from the past , so it could be proof of Atlantis or some other ancient race rumored to have existed . "
tr	2	Now you can be good or I 'll bonk you on the head with this ... sounds like as good a use as any for it .
tr	3	" That 's interesting , love , " he kept up the joke as the girls continued to giggle at the two adults ' game .
tr	1	Rick mouthed the words , " Thank you , " and blew her a kiss ... shielding it from the girls to avoid more ridicule .
tr	1	' Balancing the universe ' could also mean bringing time into sync , or , according to some physicists , bringing alternate universes into sync . "
tr	2	" Come on , " Rick struggled to fight back an enormous belly laugh , " that 's all possible too -- " " What ?
tr	0	" I don 't think I can handle any more of this today , " Kaylie said as a tear slowly rolled down her cheek .
tr	3	Moments later , they had food and drinks laid out in front of them , and Anna sat down with the remote to start their movie .
tr	4	It matches one line pretty closely -- the middle line is the stream -- " " But the stream doesn 't match , " Rick said quickly .
tr	3	I did find some history of the caves , but this study was over a hundred years old and the last mention of it was shortly after .
tr	3	" Honey , " Rick said , " I don 't want you using that thing at the meet or anywhere in public for that matter . "
tr	4	Sure enough , they were near the finish line for all of her running events and only 25 yards away from the high jump pit .
tr	2	" That 's really cool , kids , but keep your voices down and promise me you won 't look at any future ones , OK ? "
tr	4	" I 'm just a freshman ... " " And taller and stronger and faster than everyone else on the team , " Jessica interjected .
tr	0	If my calculations are right , " a brown-haired man with an enlarged nose stated , " it should impact after the planet passes Mars . "
tr	0	Anna was ahead by three yards , they had been even at the start of the straight stretch , but now she was pulling away handily .
tr	1	" It is , " Rick replied , " but I thought you girls should do something besides sit in the van all day . "
tr	1	She shortly returned with two hot dogs , a bag of chips , two orders of fries , a candy bar , and a large drink .
tr	4	There are so many mysteries we could solve so easily ... " " Then you 'd be out of a job , " Rick countered .
tr	2	" OK , " she said , pulling her clothes out of her bag , " I 'm going to the back to change . "
tr	4	Rick popped the back hatch and he pulled out a bag of old clothes , jeans and long-sleeved shirts , and began passing them out .
tr	0	Abby loaded the leftover snacks into her pack , which already held all her standard survival gear , climbing gear , and archeological tools and implements .
tr	3	This caused Rick to instantly think of the maps , which were in the front of the van , and he ran back to get them .
tr	4	Rick walked down the entire hall , lightly brushing the surface from top to bottom for nearly eighty feet until he reached an abrupt end .
tr	3	She traced a line to its end , " This appears to end , but it also goes just a bit beyond where it stops . "
tr	2	Chapter 12 -- Turning the Key Instead of an earthquake this morning , Rick awoke to voices , " Don 't they look soooo cute together ? "
tr	4	Rick , concealing his sudden apprehension , motioned for everyone to continue their jobs and asked Abby to detail the new path ahead on her map .
tr	1	Rick came to an abrupt stop as the narrow tunnel suddenly opened up into an obviously man-made and unnatural , but very beautiful scene of magnificent construction .
tr	3	He tossed the rope in the water just above the hole and watched the current suck it in , hoping it didn 't knot up .
tr	3	He balanced himself against the current at the split in order to pull up slack in the rope , and took the right path toward the light .
tr	0	I am programmed to address any concerns you have and will never displace you unless you confirm the destination and location and ask to be displaced . "
tr	4	" It would take a very long time to detail all of my functions , Kaylie , are you sure you would like an entire list ? "
tr	1	No virgin was she , but a vixen you see ; At His birth , in His bed , lays a diamond of red . "
tr	1	Rick started manipulating the display , maneuvering the image , focusing up and down , especially on the neck , wrists , fingers ... nothing .
tr	3	" I took the liberty of adding salt and ketchup , Rick ; I am programmed -- " " To anticipate my needs , right .
tr	3	" I 'm fairly confident that your guess would be completely accurate , Rick , " Rick thought a moment , looking at his daughter .
tr	2	One held boxes of coins from different times , one contained armor , swords , uniforms and many types of gadgets , old and futuristic .
tr	2	Although you and Christy are at our house more than your own , I 'm still not allowed to make such decisions for you . "
tr	3	Rick gave her an appraising look , " You two are extremely smart ; I trust you to figure that out , " he told her confidently .
tr	2	" Oh , if you 're still not interested , I can wait another two years to work up the courage again -- " " Tomorrow ! "
tr	2	Rick knelt down in front of her , placing his hands gently on her shoulders and softly shook her , " Are you OK ? "
tr	2	Kaylie talked on and on with her about clothes , and Rick prodded her for more information about the markets , army , and economy .
tr	0	" So she can watch behind me and keep an eye on Octavian -- unless you want to walk backwards and draw attention to us ? "
tr	0	He was possibly an inch taller than Rick and twenty pounds heavier -- mostly beer gut -- with a scarred , square chin and a flat nose .
tr	1	" What is it to you , veteran , " he said condescendingly , which made Rick realize he was wearing an informal military uniform .
tr	0	No harm has been done , and perhaps my daughter has learned not to stray too far from her father , " Rick said diplomatically .
tr	1	" You got lucky , girl , " Rick told her casually , " The arrow went through your side , but mainly through skin . "
tr	4	Rick fought back emotions , " We have to go , honey ... here ... " he opened his hand , showing her the enormous jewel .
tr	0	Rick worked his way to his feet , grinding the hurt away with his teeth , and held out his arms to pick her up .
tr	3	" Sorry , it wasn 't easy getting that thing off inside that small box with one arm , " he said , slightly embarrassed .
tr	1	" I was thinking of Abby since she 's an adult , but I think you 're right -- you 'd be a better choice .
tr	3	The trip back to the van took four times as long , nearly ninety minutes , because they had to stop several times for Rick to rest .
tr	3	The phrase , ' although the court thought ' , must mean she was tried and convicted , doesn 't that make sense to you ? "
tr	0	Abby called down the stairs , " The girls are already in bed and sound asleep , so I 'm gon na take a quick shower . "
tr	4	We have no reason to suspect anyone inside -- there are no lights on and the mail is five days old , " an agent responded .
tr	4	Jordan was obviously rocked by the news , but managed to finish his comment with , " He 's the last of a dying breed . "
tr	4	All the way on the flight from Mexico she had fretted over the precious load of marijuana she and Scott had been smuggling into Arizona .
tr	3	Despite the fact this was the guy that had just thrown him through the air with no apparent effort , Logan relaxed and lowered his hands .
tr	2	Maria couldn 't understand - of all the people in the building , Mark was the one who could go down to the lab now .
tr	1	Lots of local jurisdictions , California included , didn 't want citizens - even those with super powers - taking the law into their own hands .
tr	0	Mark 's old pants were folded up and put in a bag , and Josie picked him out an extra pair of pants and two more shirts .
tr	3	For the first time , she noticed at least a dozen men in dark suits , scattered around the food court at tables , watching them .
tr	0	An area of maybe three feet across formed as the crack split and turned , forming a large circle that then cracked and broke apart .
tr	4	She struggled as she was being dragged across the pavement , but her arms were caught in the leather jacket and she couldn 't squirm free .
tr	3	It had gotten him into a bad habit that might just land him in the stockade if this situation didn 't get turned around fast .
tr	2	" This is your chance to go home - but I 'll need to keep your truck for awhile , if you don 't mind . "
tr	3	If he ever saw Carlos again , he was going to kick him right in the butt for talking Josie into that motocross trip to the desert .
tr	2	Hyperion had just stopped in front of the door to a room on the back of the motel , directly adjacent to the target 's room .
tr	4	Before the stunned Hyperion could react , the blonde housewife reached up and over her shoulder with her left arm , grabbing Hyperion 's head .
tr	4	The shapeshifter flew right into the side of a parked car with sufficient force to cave the car 's door in and shatter all the windows .
tr	1	The staccato assault ranged across the giant 's chest , on his sides , down to his knee caps and back up to his throat .
tr	2	Laid out in the boat , half his skull gone , the Colonel lay still , breathing slowly , his eyes open and staring blankly upward .
tr	4	Jimmy had stopped shrieking and was squatting on the floor of the elevator , clinging to the waist-high rail running around the elevator for dear life .
tr	1	The blow didn 't break skin or bone , but sent a shockwave into the agent 's head that jarred his brain and knocked him unconscious .
tr	1	He glanced down at his severed wing , which lay twitching , partially on the concrete patio , partially hanging down limply in the water .
tr	0	More SUVs arrived , with suited agents loading Jimmy 's body bag , and a much larger one , into the plane 's cargo hold .
tr	2	Toby jumped onto the sofa and sank in , savoring the way it conformed to his body and swallowed him , making him feel warm .
tr	3	An old but amusing trick that had always entertained him , Toby found it odd that things like this could at times be remembered instinctively .
tr	0	His obesity and years of drinking gave him a ruddy appearance , the intensity of which his staff used as a barometer of his mood .
tr	3	" He trusted you with all significant negotiations , including the most important of all , the sale of Crawford Management Consultants to NET ... .
tr	1	An HS unit required both an identifiable and a pleasing appearance , allowing it to blend in with society but remain easily distinguished from human beings .
tr	4	The real engineering of the " skin " started with an applied outer layer using several materials developed a generation earlier for the movie industry .
tr	4	" The cost is largely because the procedure is new , and the resources are expensive because they are risky to obtain in the United States .
tr	1	" No , no , it 's okay , " said William , " I 'd like to read your work but I never get to it .
tr	3	Toby watched the other two and considered whether it was better to remain ignorant , or indifferent to , the emotions of others most of the time .
tr	3	The shirt had been designed by NET to control access to the facility and was outdated -- perhaps it was part of today 's test .
tr	3	Jacob 's ultimate goal was to train Toby to control multiple HS units and develop the full potential of the technologies he 'd spent a lifetime building .
tr	2	" You know I understand , " said Jacob , " but look , it 's up to you to keep us on track right now .
tr	4	" I won 't let Toby be an experiment any longer , " Victoria said with emotion , " I feel like he 's my son . "
tr	0	" Ben and I had a good laugh about the way Alfred charges around like a bull from one thing to the next , " said William .
tr	3	" That 's the last face that was attached to this suit and the host remembered it since your face isn 't covered with sensors .
tr	4	She had never seen Toby run , or the genuine glow of excitement that had been apparent in his eyes when she gave him the suit .
tr	3	William built and understands most of 007 's systems , so they will want to take William and force him to help them with 007 .
tr	3	If there 's something bad going on at NET and you want to stop it , why do they still let you on their networks ? "
tr	3	" Toby let 's do some things to protect William first , then we can talk to your mother about the rest , " said Jacob .
tr	1	Better still , a facade connection , to make it look like his lab is up and running , can be put in place . "
tr	4	He sold me on the consulting and research businesses , but Alfred , in particular , is knee deep in illegal practices in the research division .
tr	4	It was a short , abruptly planned trip , set up under the pretense of appeasing the attorneys and ensuring all the Human Resource diligence was done .
tr	4	She said that she had a meeting with some new attorney across town within the hour and she thought it would be easier with me there .
tr	2	Toby was born with an abnormal brain , as you know , but I do believe they pulled off giving him exceptional IQ and a photographic memory .
tr	3	He found Victoria looking rested and content , sitting at the kitchen island , silently watching her father , who was cooking at the stove .
tr	2	From my account , I aliased to one of your old accounts , William , so anything I touched looks like you touched it . "
tr	1	" In addition to the programs , which I realized I could basically upload and browse , William and Victoria outfitted me with an accelerometer suit .
tr	2	Toby , Victoria and Jacob , back in William 's study , could see Alfred , along with the rest of the occupants of the room .
tr	0	" Slow and steady , " Ben said truthfully , although he had picked up on William 's direction and intended to say as little as possible .
tr	0	He said he was talking with an Asian intelligence agency on a call and they likely overhead part of the plan to send William to Jakarta . "
tr	3	It 's a stretch for me to believe he 'd actually set the whole thing up , and then bring this type of story to our attention .
tr	2	007 pushed to the far side of the hall and kept moving quickly through the foot traffic , hoping to avoid an encounter and discussion .
tr	3	Alfred settled onto the seat , cursing the discomfort , relishing the total privacy and thankful to have the latest encryption software to secure his messages .
tr	1	Ahmad closely examined both Victoria and Toby , equally intrigued by the familiarity of Victoria 's beauty and by the promise of Toby 's abilities .
tr	1	" You should check your messages , " Victoria whispered as she pulled away from him , quickly catching the group and pushing toward Toby 's side .
tr	1	Through 006 's eyes , Toby could see the well-dressed Asian looking at him , first with surprise , then satisfaction , as he saw his opportunity .
tr	4	Setting up the alert in the first place was simply covering all the bases and keeping the security system up to date , Alfred told himself .
tr	3	" I will take the stairs , if you don 't mind , " said Mohammed , ignoring the question and trotting up the first few steps .
tr	4	If he needs help he 'll get someone here , but we cannot take the risk of getting others involved until this building is secure . "
tr	4	A minute later they stopped in the middle of the parking lot , and Toby set the briefcase down in plain view of a security camera .
tr	0	" Mohammed and the goon at the airport are clearly assassins , the security detail , and Ahmad is apparently Alfred 's contact for this deal .
tr	0	Victoria watched Jacob closely ; he had acted with shocking speed and power in dispatching Ahmad 's associate , then calmly confronted Ahmad without blinking .
tr	1	Frank 's team , following money trails from Indonesia to NET , found evidence that Ahmad had indeed not been working alone in funding Alfred 's projects .
tr	1	" I guess this answers any question of evacuating to Limerick , " she said , turning and moving slowly in the direction of the porch steps .
tr	0	she said as soon as they walked into her grocery shop which was lighted only by the daylight coming in through the big shop windows .
tr	2	We don 't know how to take care of horses , or where to wash our clothes -- " Sarah felt the panic blossom in her chest .
tr	3	It seemed like such a basic , little thing , she thought , to have a warm , well-lit place in which to curl up tonight .
tr	3	Sarah smiled , but the pit of fear and uneasiness returned to her stomach at the thought of their venturing out of the paddock along the roadway .
tr	3	Within minutes the three of them turned down a long dirt drive that led to a small cottage with a barn , like their own place .
tr	1	In the middle of all that , there is incredible silence and stillness -- in your mind , in your ears , in your thoughts .
tr	2	Without waiting for breakfast , David and John ran outside , John to drag in firewood and David to check on the horses and the goat .
tr	4	She realized as she mounted Dan and moved out of the frontcourt of the house that she had felt no anxiety tacking up the horse .
tr	3	Probably about the hundredth time she 'd moved him out of the stall to clean up after him , or transferred him from barn to paddock .
tr	1	" I found the culprit , " John twisted in his saddle and waved his hand to indicate that the animal was somewhere behind him .
tr	2	They 'd all feel more agreeable to opening their doors to a rag-tag group of survivors than they would a lying , thieving gang of gypsy hoodlums .
tr	4	Besides , it had been several days since John 's rabbit trap had been fruitful and they were all getting tired of biscuits and canned beans .
tr	0	Looking at their animals as sources of food rather than affection or company was a new way of framing her worldview that Sarah was determined to master .
tr	4	Could he ever have imagined back home that he 'd awake to spend a full day in the kind of conditions he expected to be in today ?
tr	0	Within seconds she found the neck through the burlap bag and , with the adrenalin pumping through her , wrenched as hard as she could .
tr	4	" You take ' er , I 'll get the boy -- " The words weren 't out of his mouth before Sarah shot him .
tr	4	Sarah recovered quickly from the recoil and turned the gun on the nearest man to her when he suddenly made a strangling noise and pitched forward .
tr	3	I don 't want to have to drag bodies any further than I need to ... " The stunned man began to stir on the ground .
tr	2	Plus , when you think about it , Devon is their only source of news of the outside world and so our only source . "
tr	0	David was very serious in reinforcing to her that if she saw anything at all that looked dangerous or threatening , she was to bypass the place .
tr	3	The thought of going out into the pasture or on any of the trails -- even with a group of other riders -- had terrified her .
tr	0	I 'm sorry , Missus , " Donovan shoved a hand through his thick hair , knocking his cheese cutter cap to the ground in the process .
tr	0	He turned to the task at hand and grabbed the shovel back from Gavin , hoping the chore would banish further thoughts along those lines .
tr	0	Anyway , I met a young woman at the market who has a major problem and it turns out we were in a position to help her .
tr	1	The next morning Sarah and John stood in the doorway of the barn with their reins in their hands and watched the rain pour down .
tr	3	She had been riding just long enough to be , if not cocky , at least confident that she wouldn 't come off him at a walk .
tr	4	The look he gave her was as deadly as any pit viper 's , she thought , trying to calm herself enough to answer him .
tr	4	" No snakes in Ireland , " John said cheerfully , and then more soberly : " Besides it 's the wrong time of year for them .
tr	0	She sat on a small Highland pony , her hair down by her waist , looking pretty and farfetched like something in an Irish fairytale .
tr	4	It had stopped hurting him weeks ago , whether because it had finally mended or had died , itself , he had no way of knowing .
tr	4	He 'd been on the farm a total of two days when he fell off a ladder , hit his head and broke his arm .
tr	4	" I 've already put your valise in the cart , " she said , smiling and trying to make her voice sound reassuring and cheerful .
tr	0	This new clear-headed reading Seamus was kind of a pain in the ass , Sarah found herself thinking as she laid the reins back down .
tr	2	She took a breath and edged herself across the room to try to catch a glimpse of what was going on outside the front door .
tr	2	Sarah grabbed the only thing she could find -- a small rolling pin -- and scrambled up onto the kitchen counter by the bedroom door .
tr	0	So joyous was she to have Seamus alive -- and clear-headed -- that she sat next to him , holding his hand like an awestruck schoolgirl .
tr	3	Tonight , the thought of someone taking him from her made her feel as cold and strong as granite , a granite that could crush and kill .
tr	3	" It 's just ... " she picked up a mug and then set it back down again as if not trusting she wouldn 't drop it .
tr	0	Sarah took a long breath and felt the agony of the day wash over her in a shroud of exhaustion and , for a moment , futility .
tr	0	His words shook her out of the moment and she gathered her reins tightly in her hands and pushed Dan down the hill with her legs .
tr	0	He ran to Sarah who was kneeling by the little dog and looking at the burning cottage , her face a mask of unreadable agony .
tr	4	He looked at the burning house as a large piece of timber came crashing down in front of them , making them both take a step back .
tr	4	They were coming to a moment , she knew , when the rain would put out the fire completely and enable them to enter the cottage .
tr	0	-- about whether she should allow him to play football or if they should tell him his hamster died , she wanted to laugh outloud .
tr	4	She didn 't really know what she was doing but it made her feel like she was preparing in some way for the fight ahead .
tr	2	" I don 't know why I think so but somehow I don 't think I could be doing any of this without you . "
tr	4	Now , if you 've checked on your gallant steed , we 'll be seeing what delights Fiona has cooked up for our pleasure this evening . "
tr	4	The other gypsy , Brendan , eased back down onto the ground next to David and gave the little campfire a poke with a long stick .
tr	4	She watched the older boy scoop her son up and the two playfully wrestle in the dirt before Fiona shooed them away from the fire .
tr	2	" I have no idea as to the best way to handle any of this and am only too happy to be told what to do . "
tr	3	Up to this moment , he thought Sarah and John were living placidly and quietly in the little cottage just as he 'd left them .
tr	4	Before he turned to go back into the house where he would drink alone until he fell asleep , his glance fell briefly on David .
tr	0	From what he 'd heard last night around the campfire , he was fairly certain he knew the direction that Sarah 's party was coming .
tr	3	In fact , now that she thought about it , she realized that once David was back , she wouldn 't need to think about it .
tr	0	" Now , I may smell a little raw ... " He laughed heartily at his own joke and then indicated the path back to the camp .
tr	0	Donovan 's horse had spooked nearly an hour earlier leaving him with a broken arm and the raiding party drinking tea by a quickly waning breakfast fire .
tr	0	" Alive , we can make you a rich man , Brendan , " David had said , holding his bound hands out to the big gypsy .
tr	1	Finn turned from Sarah and looked in the direction his men were pointing in and , for a moment , Sarah saw his face relax and soften .
tr	0	She was surprised to be able to realize that , without the hate and the anger manipulating his face , he had a pleasant face .
tr	2	" You can bet there 's a guard on the front door , though , " John said , resuming his work on her cord .
tr	1	He rode in , his arm in a sling , Aidan and Jimmy behind him and Fiona and two plucky and pissed-off wives behind them .
tr	0	Now , as she sat on the porch , she was watching and waiting to see Donovan 's wagon come around the main driveway to their farm .
tr	3	" You would if you 'd just spent two hours standing in the middle of a pasture trying to fix a gap in the fence .
tr	2	" This mate of Gavin 's says communication in London is almost completely restored and there 's a few vehicles moving about there now too . "
tr	3	When we found out three months ago that this life here was probably temporary , it 's hard to explain but life actually got harder !
tr	1	He made the reins fast to the fork of a sapling , and turned about , hands on his hips , to survey his surroundings .
tr	4	She burned with eagerness to seize that splendid figure and crush it in her iron arms , yet she greatly desired not to hurt the boy .
tr	0	Valerian had already heard , and a chill crept through his veins ; so he unconsciously laid his white hand on his companion 's muscular brown arm .
tr	0	She was a barbarian , and the terrible patience of the wilderness and its children was as much a part of her as her lusts and rages .
tr	3	The sun had set and darkness was gathering over the plain , lightened a little by the stars that made stunted ghosts out of the cactus growths .
tr	2	Once the sword was drawn there was no turning back ; for blood called for blood , and vengeance followed swift on the heels of atrocity .
tr	2	Alone in the room , the pirate shot the bolts on all the doors , kicked off his boots and stretched luxuriously out on the couch .
tr	0	An attack on the great bronze door from without was always a possibility , but for many years no such assault had been attempted on either side .
tr	1	It passed by in the form of an ancient woman with flowing white locks and locks , and luminous eyes that blazed in the darkness .
tr	3	He lost his dirk in the first moment of contact , and thereafter found himself powerless to inflict any appreciable pain on his giant attacker .
tr	0	She carried his through a door that stood opposite that through which she had entered , crossed another room and began stealing down a hall .
tr	0	There was a sharp crackling sound and the ray of fire flashed from his chest and struck the black altar , with a snapping of blue sparks .
tr	4	" There is enough clean loot in the world for you and me , " he said , straightening to stand tall and splendid before her .
tr	1	" You be careful out there , " Clem said , tilting his bottle in the cop 's direction before raising it to his lips .
tr	4	When he came out of the dunes , Lucas caught his first glimpse of the stretch and realized suddenly exactly what Tomlinson had been talking about .
tr	2	Lucas took a moment to compose himself before getting out of his own car , wiping his forehead , and clenching his bowels once more .
tr	4	A long disused drive-in screen in Wellfleet was a total loss , while two more houses built on the beaches of Chatham tumbled into the sea .
tr	2	Below the fold , a brief sidebar noted that the shifting sands of the Cape had once again proved too great a force for man to control .
tr	0	This time , a narrow slice of land jutting into the bay that locals called " Sully 's Rump " was once again an island .
tr	1	He kept his head down , looking for bits of sea glass , broken shells , or pieces of discarded trash to use in his art projects .
tr	2	Lately , he 'd taken to making artwork from the boxes and boxes of fireworks he brought back with him from his frequent trips to Florida .
tr	3	He walked all around and then into the thing , touching the beams and the pegs , holding his hands apart to guesstimate the distances .
tr	3	No reason they can 't touch it , but ask them to leave it intact so there 'll be something left for the scientists to investigate .
tr	1	Ships of a certain age often kept chickens on board , both for their prodigious egg laying capabilities as well as their delicious meat . "
tr	4	But one day , two of the skeletal beams went missing , and even he knew that was far more than needed for any testing .
tr	2	" Folks 'll pay a lot of money for a real shipwreck ... One guy wants the whole damn thing for the floor of his study .
tr	0	And anyway , something had happened between this afternoon and now that made him certain what he was about to do was more important than ever .
tr	1	As planned , the flame branched off , with a new branch running off to the left while the original continued its slow burn up the dune .
tr	4	Before that arsenal was expended , he began to hear the whizzing and zooming of bottle rockets escaping from their hidden lairs to shoot skyward .
tr	4	Though nude swimming and sunbathing were illegal in town , there were a few hidden coves here and there where that sort of thing was tolerated .
tr	3	And though he wondered what that was all about , it gave Chris his first real opportunity to get a good look at the man .
tr	3	He looked up at the night sky and thought it might be brightening a bit in the east and knew he had to get home .
tr	0	Grabbing the nearest Danish , he threw it on a napkin and began walking quickly toward the side door , but it was too late .
tr	4	Chris watched the man take a long sip of coffee before moving the plate to his mouth where he captured a donut in his teeth .
tr	4	The man put a quizzical look on his face , but after Chris did it a few more times , he seemed to get it .
tr	4	Barney had devoted a few acres on a bluff overlooking the ocean to their enclosure , ensuring the massive birds had plenty of room to roam .
tr	0	The rest ... " he said , waving his hand around the room , though really addressing the whole world , " is all shades of gray .
tr	0	As always , Chris found the view breathtaking , struck once again that such a humble and unassuming man had done so well for himself .
tr	4	The roof of the boathouse where Barney kept his yacht and still had room for another soared three stories above the bluff across from them .
tr	4	~ After leaving Cobb 's house on the afternoon of their cryptic conversation , Chris repeated those phrases in his mind that he needed to remember .
tr	1	He was still repeating them in his mind when his mother insisted he join her and Misty Rowling for supper , and his suspicions rose .
tr	1	Sometimes , he just zoned out and surfed the web , finding out what was going on outside his small domain that was Sully 's Rump .
tr	0	Though he had an idea now what he was looking for , he still thought " Mary Rose " might take more time than Vasa had .
va	3	~ Chris wasn 't at all surprised to see the green glow the next day , and the day after that , and the day after that .
va	4	When the bump of a large swell brought Chris out of his thoughts , he realized he 'd been unconsciously running his tongue along his teeth .
va	4	He used a number of frightening instruments to remove the wire , then used a pair of specialized pliers to twist the brackets from each tooth .
va	2	Glancing up , he noted the man looked at him funny , but thought it was probably nothing compared to his own look of horror .
va	0	He turned to Chris and asked , " What do ya say ' bout a man who paints canvases black and sells ' em as art ?
va	3	Didn ' wan na say anythin ' at the time , but that last set a yers lef ' a whole lot to be desired .
va	0	He was talking about how they did that to a couple of other ships , a Swedish ship called Vasa and another called the Mary Rose . "
va	4	There was some half-hearted struggling , but moments later , Billy Grey looked up and saw Chris had his arms raised to show he meant no harm .
va	3	Now stained and dirty , Chris thought it might be time to either show them how to do laundry or simply get them more clothes .
va	2	Of course , they could all be wearing clown noses and floppy shoes and what was going on in this room would still look threatening .
va	2	Things quieted down when the social hour was over , guests either going out to sit on the front porch or going back to their rooms .
va	4	Chris knew then for sure there was more going on here than ... " She 's a beautiful ship , isn 't she laddie ? "
va	4	The captain went quiet for a long time before saying , " Sends a shiver down me spine just to utter those accursed words . "
va	3	~ Arthur Cobb was disappointed to see the story had made the news , but it wasn 't as bad as it might 've been .
va	3	At one point , he reached out and grabbed Fletcher 's wrist , hoping to once and for all put a stop to that confounded twirling .
va	1	But only moments after stepping outside , the cold rain , chilly wind , and fresh air invigorated his spirits and blew away his nausea .
va	4	And as he stared into the small depression where only yesterday an ancient shipwreck lay , the ranger surmised the same thing had happened here .
va	2	The professor had been courteous enough to introduce him to the foreman in charge of the operation , who had promised to keep disruptions to a minimum .
va	0	Toward the end of the ranger 's talk , Cobb had simply wandered away , walking toward the shore while staring down at the beach .
va	3	They came to town for the Pride festival , to party at one of the clubs that catered to them , or to simply use the beaches .
va	4	And all those specimens of rats and chickens and other things he 'd found near the wreck had disappeared from his makeshift workspace in the office .
va	1	So I guess what I 'm trying to say is , these animals aren 't here just for his pleasure or to be a sideshow .
va	1	The gray haired and obviously ancient chimp was mostly bored this afternoon , sitting in his lounge chair and incessantly changing the television channel with the remote .
va	3	She talked about how she 'd have to rethink things in terms of animal captivity , though she still felt it was wrong to eat any animal .
va	2	" Just how it 's going to be so cool to have a total lunar eclipse the very same night a comet comes so close to earth .
va	4	Chris thought he might 've seen a quick glance pass between Barney and his lawyer , Dawkins , and the lawyer might have subtly acknowledged it .
va	2	She was currently confessing her sins to the local priest , a good looking young man who , unbeknownst to her , was in love with her .
va	2	He took one last long look at the guy at the end of the bar before leaning forward again and looking up toward the television .
va	3	And though it really wasn 't , they would all be paid handsomely for their efforts , both tonight and for the rest of the summer .
va	3	Clem nodded and turned back to the window , awaiting three quick blinks of a flashlight that was his signal to pull up to the dock .
va	0	But while there , another call came in , and what had happened to the octogenarian security guard at Wal-Mart really burned Lucas 's buttons .
va	4	The thieves had arrived in a horde , swooping down on the place after the security guard unwittingly opened the door to have a cigarette .
va	0	Of course , the Xanax might have been kicking in about then , so Lucas wasn 't sure how much was real and how much was imagination .
va	1	He said he was on his way to Annie 's Variety to pick up some things for the inn , but had some time to kill .
va	2	And if you 're not , I mean , if you don 't have any other plans , maybe we could go together or something .
va	0	I 'm going to bring a blanket , some snacks , and ... " Chris glanced at his watch and said he really had to get going .
va	3	Oh , that 's marvelous ... " ~ Chris did go to the movie on Saturday night , though he showed up a little late .
va	2	But now , he wondered if maybe there wasn 't something bigger going on , somebody trying to pass off worthless third-world currency in this country .
va	2	Someone was trying to pass off worthless Mexican or Panamanian or Peruvian coins as legal tender right here in the good old U.S. of A .
va	0	There was always a fire engine or two , a couple of floats , the boy scouts , and a high school band from the mainland .
va	4	After catching his eye , the captain removed his hat and waved it in salute before putting his arm behind his back and bowing deeply .
va	4	If any of them were thinking that Seth himself chaired the personnel committee , they were too much the gentlemen and ladies to say it .
va	0	But on this day , he walked to the rack and saw his own smiling and clean-shaven face staring out at him from above the fold .
va	4	He was careful not to let the reporter look too closely at the bell , for fear he 'd be able to make out the name .
va	4	" Would you mind telling me exactly when the first of these showed up , and the names of the people who came in with them ? "
va	4	Pausing , he leaned forward to eye a nice looking woman who had gotten up from her beach towel to dip her toes into the water .
va	4	A second team of men lined up next to another four beams and the drill was repeated : they beat their sledges and the beams fell .
va	1	The crowd watched the cop raise his head skyward , as if his imagining the thing in all its glory could somehow conjure it up again .
va	3	Begun as something of a joke , it had since taken on an almost ritual quality , a silent signal that they were all in this together .
va	0	The hat was in his hand now , to let the wind whip back his shoulder-length hair , but mostly , so he wouldn 't lose it .
va	4	He let the words linger a while , and if anything at all had been left in Cobb 's bladder , it wasn 't anymore .
va	1	On the desk , Chris saw two boxes , no doubt containing compass and sextant and other items necessary for navigation in the age of sail .
va	2	From Charlestown and Winthrop in the north , to Castle Island in South Boston , to the banks of Dorchester Bay , families and young couples gathered .
va	3	Sitting at a half empty table next to Calvin Pickett , Seth was determined to enjoy his desert of vanilla ice cream and pastry puff .
va	4	She seemed to hang there a moment , an eerie ghost ship with , of all things , a dog barking excitedly on its deck .
va	3	The crowd continued to watch as the ship sailed away , paying no attention to the huge Russian barque that was next on the program .
va	3	That 's what Chris had been trying to think of , what had been on the tip of his tongue for the last twenty-four hours or so .
va	4	Even better news , your children will receive a similar stipend , and their children , and their children , for many generations to come .
va	4	And so , in the spirit of this merger between two great companies , I am going to grant your father 's wishes and then some . "
va	3	I also suspect that whatever 's going to happen , it 's going to happen just outside Nutmeg Cove , the place the ship went down . "
va	1	Looking down , Chris said it was nothing , hoping if he ever found himself in a similar situation , someone would do the same for him .
va	4	From the open water just outside the cove , brilliant beams of light began shining in their direction from what looked like a half-dozen vessels .
va	2	In fact , it was your lawyers who chose the word ' contiguous ' when there are so many other wonderful words to choose from .
va	4	On the other hand , he thought , once he made that grade , his trips to the Rump would be fewer and far between .
va	3	' I think we might still get the goods if you flash your eyes at her , ' said my partner thoughtfully after a while .
va	4	It was several decades before the full extent of the devastation was realised , for the plague had brought with it an unexpected and horrifying complication .
va	4	Twice a year , my father would venture down the mountain to the nearest village , where he traded fur for oil and other rare goods .
va	3	We stopped at a set of traffic lights and earned a battery of hostile stares from a gang of teens standing next to the intersection .
va	4	Over the years -- at times using independent contractors , but mostly doing the work myself -- I modified the tower block for my own personal use .
va	0	Although I abhorred violence and opted not to carry a gun , my life as an immortal had taught me that it was a necessary evil .
va	0	Carved into the blade of the katana was an identical copy of the intertwined alpha and omega birthmark branded into the skin over my heart .
va	3	As I crossed the concrete floor briskly , my steps echoing off the distant walls , my thoughts turned to the events of the last twenty-four hours .
va	2	By the time I landed on my back and skidded halfway across the water slicked rooftop , I had fired half the rounds in both guns .
va	4	' Hey , Cain , you never told me he was this puny , ' said the giant in front of me in a heavy European accent .
va	4	The matter I wish to discuss is a rather delicate one , and I believe he 's in the best position to assist me . '
va	4	Despite actively canvassing the streets and advertising for a reward in the local paper , she still had not heard any news about the absent feline .
va	0	There was a play area for children , an artificial lake with ducks and other water fowls , an extensive expanse of lawn and several wooded areas .
va	4	The sudden judder of the metal steps beneath my feet drew my gaze downward again : two men in black suits were climbing the fire escape .
va	4	Not that he needed to check the facts : he looked like the kind of cop who 'd memorise everything about a person in a flash .
va	0	I walked across to a black Toyota Land Cruiser with white racing stripes and smoked windows , and started to load our bags onto the back seat .
va	3	Discreet booths overhung with black rococo curtains afforded privacy to those that needed it , although the muted lighting provided enough of that as it was .
va	2	In my short immortal life , I had only ever known compassion from my parents : it took a while for my mistrust to fade .
va	3	At the bottom of the page , a black and white photograph depicted the principal actors and the director posing with famous local patrons of the Arts .
va	0	In addition to a couple of small bags of high quality diamonds , five gold bars and several passports , the safe held a dozen document wallets .
va	0	One name in particular , a Professor HE Strauss , appeared as a common contributor in most of the publications and had been highlighted in red ink .
va	3	' I know this probably doesn 't mean a lot to you at the moment , but they weren 't good men , ' I said quietly .
va	1	' I was passing through and thought I 'd look up an old university friend , a person by the name of HE Strauss ? '
va	1	I 'm terribly sorry , I 'm afraid I 'm the only HE Strauss living at this address , ' he said with a weak smile .
va	4	It had a beautiful vaulted ceiling and a stone fireplace , and had been tastefully decorated with an eclectic collection of old and opulent furnishings .
va	3	Documents lay scattered haphazardly within wallets and folders inside the drawers of the writing desk and the filing cabinets that stood around the walls of the study .
va	0	On the rear wall , next to an oil canvas reproduction of Degas 's 1888 " Dancers " , was a spattering of dried blood .
va	2	' Anyone who wants to stop me from smoking will have to kill me first and prise this out of my cold , dead fingers . '
va	4	After passing through the hands of several Holy Roman Emperors in the ensuing centuries , it finally became part of the independent Swiss Confederation in 1291 .
va	4	Hazel bushes and honeysuckle shrubs formed a natural hedge around the yard and the air was redolent of the sweet smell of late blooming flowers .
va	3	' Hmm , I don 't know whether this matters or not , but I just saw her assistant , Helena , ' he muttered .
va	3	The local police and Interpol are currently studying CCTV images from the station and from around the city close to the time of the incident .
va	2	Behind the bar , a walrus of a man stood polishing glasses while talking softly to a pair of wizened figures hunched on low wooden stools .
va	0	He rolled up the sleeve on his left arm and showed us a faint jagged scar that ran almost all the way around his biceps .
va	3	I leapt , pushed at the wall with one foot , twisted through the air and kicked the weapon out of the immortal 's hand .
va	3	He dropped to his knees , his fingers clutching at the crimson jet spurting from the fatal wound at his throat , before collapsing to the ground .
va	1	They pushed us roughly to the ground , slapped cuffs on our wrists and read us our rights before hauling us back onto our knees .
va	4	It was close to the banks of the upper Danube Canal and across the road from one of the campuses of the city 's university .
va	1	' You were also involved in the incident at the Hauptbahnhof in Zurich , ' he said abruptly , having evidently decided to switch tactics .
va	2	Though I had known the immortal for only a short time , I did not wish to be responsible for the death of yet another person .
va	1	As he crossed the ground towards me , he put away the gun and suppressor in his hand and reached for the sword at his waist .
va	4	Although the old man looked like he had recovered from his wounds , he seemed to have aged even more since I last saw him .
va	3	The strong feeling of foreboding that had lingered at the back of my mind since I first met Tomas Godard suddenly crystallised into a cold certainty .
va	3	They chose to do so in the Carpathian Mountains , which were vastly unpopulated and isolated from the rest of the world at the time . '
va	3	Thirty minutes later , after carefully piecing together the forty pairs of Okazaki fragments scattered across twenty pages of text , we had the first cipher .
va	2	' By the sounds of it , I 'm about to have plenty of that precious commodity on my hands soon enough , ' she said drily .
va	0	' By the way , ' said Roman , looking at me curiously , ' that 's an interesting design you have on your katana .
va	4	The irony that we both fought on the same side during those tumultuous years and yet were unaware of each other 's presence did not escape me .
va	1	' I hate to say it , but this is not looking good , ' said Reid while we took cover within a narrow thicket .
va	3	' You can introduce cells that have the ability to evolve into different types of tissues into the body , to carry out specific functions . '
va	4	' It uses the pathogen 's genetic information instead of the usual method of culture to identify immunogenic antigens that can be targeted for vaccine development . '
va	3	The grass on the lawn still bore the fading whiteness of an overnight frost and the chill in the air hinted at the approaching winter .
va	0	Bruno had wandered to the end of the east hallway : he was staring at something in an adjacent corridor , his gun pointed downward .
va	3	' It 's a good thing Anatole didn 't come with us , ' I murmured , glancing at the containment cages on a table .
va	4	We had just reached the junction to the next hallway when the roof caved in behind us , crushing the lab in a mound of debris .
va	3	' I 'm sorry to interrupt , but has anyone given any thought to the mortals who 'll be working with us on the ground ? '
va	4	That leaves about fifty guards watching the access to the underground garage and the ground floor , as well as the dozen others spread out above . '
va	0	' McCabe 's not too pleased about you taking all the bodies away , ' said Lacroix as I climbed into a van after Reid .
va	0	I 'll be sure to tell him that the man he trusted as a friend for so many years is not a criminal after all . '
va	2	The return to Blue Ridge took less time than our outward journey , with our convoy doing over a hundred miles an hour for the most part .
va	2	' I will not have you doubt our allegiance to our race so easily Costas , although I understand why you would think that way . '
va	0	A dozen transport and fighter planes , as well as a pair of combat search and rescue helicopters , stood parked across the extensive tarmac .
va	4	The eight of us rose and went through the safety procedures we had been taught that afternoon under the keen eyes of Vincenzo 's lieutenants .
va	3	At the two thousand feet signal , I reached behind and pulled the pilot chute out from the bottom pocket of the container strapped to my back .
va	4	I turned my attention to the computer on the table , reached inside my jumpsuit and plugged a slim USB device in one of the ports .
va	0	We finally reached a hidden alcove in the south facing wall of a tower , where a metal door stood framed by a pair of heavy drapes .
va	2	Without pausing for breath , I lifted a card from one of the dead men and moved it over the control panel of the door .
va	3	' They 're lucky I didn 't shoot them , ' Anna muttered with a dark scowl as she stormed past us towards the exit .
va	1	' You know , not that I 'm complaining or anything , but we haven 't seen anyone for a while now , ' Reid said quietly .
va	0	There was a faint electronic hum as the clear liquid inside was aspirated into a piece of glass tubing and started to move along a narrow pipe .
va	4	' Glad to see you 're still alive , old man , ' Victor said to Godard with a grim smile once they were within earshot .
va	0	' The origin of our two immortal races is a subject that has always fascinated me , even as a child , ' he said slowly .
va	0	Both Anna and I had found it a miracle in itself that she had fallen pregnant so easily , and after our very first night together .
va	2	I sighed and locked my door because I didn 't want to return back home and to discover my room upside-down and investigated by my mom .
va	4	I opened the boot , I lifted my luggage and then I went with my mother to the airport entrance , egregious piece of folly .
va	4	The image of roaring water came into my eyes ... and ... I opened my eyes suddenly and I knew someone was standing beside me .
va	1	After couple of minutes , she returned with a glass of water and I drank it all without blinking , realizing how thirsty I was .
va	1	She was right , if I was in her position I really didn 't know what to do and most likely I would go insane .
va	4	" It is such a relief to hear that you are well , I hope you are well , do you have water with you ?
va	4	You are just being in a mess a little bit , " she said , putting her hand over my clamped fist on the table .
va	3	After she left , I came back to Abby wanting to know every detail ; being frustrated that I did not managed to read that bloody brief .
va	2	I really did not want to explain to someone why I did this , especially to her , who probably would say again how funny I am .
va	2	If you will do this , I 've to give up too , which I don 't want to do this for the life of me . "
va	1	Chapter III - Friendships " I am that kind of person who doesn 't want to risk his life , or to do crazy stuff .
va	3	But not for the sake of dancing and drinking , but in this way we can meet Laurence better , to get along with him . "
va	4	" Yeah Eddy , let 's get in , " Helen said , and when I heard how she called me I remain with my mouth opened .
va	2	I was looking at her lost and I really wanted to tell her how I feel , but the words were too stubborn to come out .
va	3	Still was it saying to search , to fight with Laurence for Abby , and to put in the girl 's silky hands my heart .
va	2	" Abby , I ... " " No , please , just listen ... I care about you to much to let you go away .
va	3	She cares about our friendship and not ... I got up from the chair and went softly in the balcony , watching the beautiful sea .
va	0	Why should I make her this favor , considering that she was hiding the truth from me and she didn 't care less if I had problems .
va	2	Anyway I wrote down my sorrow , which my mother advice me to do , but I wonder how much she could care about this ?
va	1	I couldn 't say to no one my plan with Laurence beside him , Damian Jones , in which I had the most powerful faith .
va	3	I start to laugh at the last sentence , but felt much horrible then I was a minute before , when I was sad that he left .
va	4	Damian 's words were playing in my head , making a sentence : " Do you think that the scientists are sleeping with their lab mice ? "
va	0	I knew that he couldn 't stand Laurence , and I came with his medical files to save Damian 's ass to work on this case .
va	1	I laughed , going out in the night 's chill from Crete , and I 've seen him smiling , seating on his expensive and silvery car .
va	3	I couldn 't do anything , I trusted him , but on some dark bitch with a guy easy crazy , the trusting could be measure .
va	4	Never , but never , a boy wasn 't romantic with me , especially to have sort of a picnic on the beach by night time .
va	0	He was with blood all , breathing jerky and watching me with a look that frights even your soul , having the knife in his hand .
va	0	He let me got , and really walked away , leaving me with my broke arcade and with a scare that wasn 't passing that easily .
va	2	Therefore , I hang out the phone and took my bag , with some clothes in it , ready to get out from the room .
va	2	I closed the door in my way back and I went down to the reception very quietly , trying to not think too much of some consequences .
va	4	She already pissed me off and I avoid her , but she didn 't give up that easy , starting to follow me in the reception lobby .
va	1	I know that some how I am making a mistake , and if my teachers will find out ... " " Imagine him finding out . "
va	2	He said with cold , avoiding intentional my look " I know you probably hate me , but I will not let you ignore me forever .
va	2	" Abby , I ... " " No , please , just listen ... I care about you to much to let you go away .
va	3	At that question , I wanted somehow to tell him the truth about that night , but I preferred to lower my look back to my knees .
va	3	He stood up , wanting to kiss me , but I just thank him for the flowers and I took a seat elegant in front of him .
va	4	At least he and the rest of the world , I didn 't want to imagine Damian if he would found out the rape scene .
va	1	I said , laying somehow with my head in Laurence 's lap , popping into my mind the memory of my first day in Greece .
va	3	I didn 't want to stay in that hell heat in the front of the airport , especially in a not so great company like Helen .
va	2	To not hear a word from her mouth , I took from my bag an mp3 player and I put my headphones in my ears .
va	1	I turned around and I saw that I was in a big room , quite antic style , like it was someone 's rich bedroom .
va	0	You do not know what actually happened that night and it is not my fault that Damian saw me doing what I have done . "
va	3	He said serious to me , when I put my hand on the latch and got out , heading to the hotel , to start packing .
va	3	And I really didn 't want to throw away my dream , just because of a boy , I didn 't yet end up that idiot .
va	4	I couldn 't resist no longer , I was finished , my nerves were shot , I was about to explode if she would say a word .
va	3	An idea was to cry a little to Lars , to pretend that I was sorry , and some innocent tears didn 't hurt to no one .
va	2	The condition was to not reveal this plan to you , but to observe how you would try to not reveal your truth to me .
va	1	I put my head on the cold window , staring into space , my mind flew at him and at the situation I was in .
va	2	I entered with courage in the courtyard , opening slowly the creaky door and tried to go on a path straight to the house door .
va	4	She purred in two white cups , boiled water over some tea bags , with her hand shaking , was she thinking why I came ?
va	1	Usually Damian was alone , not having friends and he isn 't the type of guy to hang out with a gang in the town .
va	3	" Only the thought to not see him again hurts like hell , not to mention that I came here for him , for a reason .
va	3	I was watching the crowded road , not knowing what to believe , just to stop planning and to stop thinking at the worst things can happen .
va	3	" I really wanted to see the child tonight so we could get things straight on how life will go on from this time forward .
va	2	For some reason that he couldn 't name , Simon fell back on the floor and scooted backwards towards the hard bed in one corner .
va	0	" Your parents , and that girl , " he said , his hair going every which way as he pulled a shirt over his head .
va	4	We hope to ensure that your father 's fortune is held securely for you , as well as - " The woman came forward and interrupted him .
va	2	For one moment , Virgil , Theodosia , and Miriam stood like a group getting a photo taken : ' Portrait of a Disturbing Scene . '
va	1	However , Theo , I think I can get everything up and running in a month or so , and we may begin the new project . "
va	1	" But of course , Mrs. Williams , " he murmured , polishing the fruit and adding it to the pile in the large napkin .
va	1	First , wages , as well as uniforms , and rooms , and also meals -- no , I cannot condone such a foolish scheme . "
va	3	We 're sorry to take up your time and all that , but you can see for yourself that it just won 't do at all .
va	3	Yet , for some reason , she didn 't want to appear stupid in front of this calm , tidy person buttoning up her dress .
va	1	I was merely looking for -- " " You were wondering what the governess is doing , " Virgil said , biting the top off a cigar .
va	3	" Just that I hear the whistle of the train that comes at night , and I don 't like it , that 's all . "
va	2	The floor was made of wooden boards , rather weathered , but a cream rug with poppies on it lay in front of the windows .
va	1	" I 'll come in every night and sit in here as it goes by , " Mana said , turning Miriam to face her .
va	2	" She could come from the bottom of the ocean , for all I care , " Mrs. Williams vigorously scraped the bottom of a bowl .
va	0	" Aunt Theodosia thinks he 's the shining light of the world ; she bought him three presents from town today and had them wrapped .
va	0	He had never heard him say a word to either of his parents , and here he was asking questions of a tall woman with black skin .
va	3	Neil was writing to his parents and his sisters , and the rain fell steadily outside , putting a stop to any plans to go anywhere .
va	2	Don 't you have a house party coming , or a trip to the Bishop 's Well , or a ball to go to ? "
va	4	She climbed up onto the rocks and picked her way between the rock pools , feeling the way with her damp , bare feet on the stones .
va	3	" It wasn 't until he started beating them all in cards , and winning all their money , that they started to tolerate him . "
va	2	" Simon put up the funds for me to play , and -- " " -- And you beat him hollow , " Simon finished .
va	3	Miriam , Simon , and Neil walked over to the pool and tilted the jar into the water , and the animal instantly slithered out .
va	0	Uncle Virgil was standing behind Theodosia 's chair , a glass in his hand as usual , and a stranger sat opposite them on a sofa .
va	1	" True vision is so hard to find , as I 'm sure Miriam will discover for herself one day , " Mr. Cantwell continued .
va	0	Chapter 14 Mr. Cantwell Acts in a Suspicious Manner our essay on Hadrian is well-written , " Mana said , " but it lacks some polish .
va	0	Look at you -- you were acting like a savage when I first arrived , and now I can almost state that you 're civilized . "
va	1	" You 're right , " Neil said , pulling out a piece of paper that was covered with his neat handwriting in a long list .
va	3	That one afternoon was the only time the circles were sticking out from the stone , or had distended , or whatever it is that they do .
va	4	A heavy silence fell , and he looked at his plate , feeling his wrists grow three inches , and his feet increase by five sizes .
va	0	" Call me Barbara , please , " the sister said in a curiously light , husky voice , gracefully touching two fingers to Theodosia 's palm .
va	2	Suppose he won 't want to come down to the sea with us and Mana and hunt for shrimps tomorrow , " Miriam said regretfully .
va	2	Neil groaned to himself and turned away from the mirror , to see Simon with a bowl of hot water and a razor , trying to shave .
va	1	As the sweet course was brought in , Miriam hissed at him under cover of the clinking of china and silver , " Stop it !
va	0	Miriam had to admit that she had a good voice , although , did she really have to gaze at Simon like that as she sang ?
va	0	" I 've had some suspicions for a while , and what happened last night made me more certain that I must act , and soon .
va	1	" Miss Cantwell is the most dangerous person I have ever met , and it looks as though she has won the first round . "
va	2	" My heavens , you are just a schoolboy , and yet you manage to put most of the grown men I know to shame ! "
va	1	Simon had forgotten to tell Neil to get dressed for dinner in his rush to escort Miss Cantwell , so he was upstairs as well .
va	4	He watched her , seeing how the glowing coils of her hair lay against the deep copper of her dress , and he said nothing .
va	4	" But I had to deal with such nonsense at the beginning ; believe me , Barbara , you don 't know what I suffered . "
va	3	I 'm sure that you have items that are private to you , and I must ask you to respect my privacy as well . "
va	3	Miriam , dying to run at Theodosia and smack her or throw coffee in her face or both , kept still with a great effort .
va	1	Satisfied , he got up and , retrieving his cigar , resumed puffing on it as though nothing had occurred out of the ordinary that evening .
va	3	In her haste , she didn 't notice that she had left the Crown Phoenix typewriter sitting out in the middle of the attic room floor .
va	1	" Neil , you stay here and watch the horse ; I 'll go with Miriam and find out what 's happening , if anything . "
va	3	Neil felt that Poole , if that was the driver 's name , would take to an unseen occupant of his cart none too kindly .
va	4	When it came to geometry and algebra , however , Neil left Simon far behind and was even able to help him with his lessons .
va	0	His hands gripped the stones and he tipped his head back , allowing the liquid to soak his head , his hair , and his clothes .
va	0	Do come inside , and you can have a drink , and a small bite to eat , and you can rest and get clean .
va	0	The giant bowed deeply a few times , and backed away to a little cupboard , and began to pull out cups , plates and napkins .
va	0	Al least he could get an idea of what the island was like and , possibly , make an effort to find where Mana was being held .
va	0	The waves , which were much stronger here , rushed up and hit the " thumb " which sent the spray up to coat the rocks .
va	2	" It has to do with Miriam , Mr. Pearson 's daughter , and Simon , the son of the man who runs the company now .
va	0	And would they suffer nightmares like his recent dreams , about Simon and Miriam and Mana , all caught in dreadful traps with no escape ?
va	0	He straightened in his chair and opened his mouth , making up his mind to pour out his grievances , when a thought struck him .
va	4	However , no one he had met in his previous life would be able to come close to Riki 's parents for avoiding a question .
va	4	Balancing his fishing pole between his knees , he took off his glasses and wiped the spray off them with the tail of his shirt .
va	1	Riki flung out an arm in a dramatic fashion , sending her line with its sharp hook and wriggling bait into the nearby picnic basket .
va	3	Neil caught up with him just as he opened the door to a small shack that looked as if it had been built out of rusted metal .
va	3	At the same time , the cook tried to maneuver the bowl of soup into his other huge palm , causing the tray to tilt perilously .
va	3	" Your majesty has done much already for that man in the matter of the -- " he mentioned something that Neil didn 't understand .
va	1	Days of swimming , fishing and running after Riki , however , had made him leaner and stronger , so that the climb wasn 't too difficult .
va	4	This time Neil was able to see the length of the tunnel for some yards ; however , he couldn 't make out where it actually ended .
va	0	His scalp still itched at the thought of all the ooze they had crawled through , and the live things slithering over his legs - ugh .
va	4	It was much easier going this way ; it was also better when there were other people to carry supplies and point out possible pitfalls .
va	4	They dropped the chain and flung themselves back against the rock as the chain slid with ominous rapidity over the rock and crashed down on the underside .
va	2	" You two will have the important job of pretending to be normal -- playing a game , or feeding the parrot , or some such .
va	2	It drummed down on the roof so loudly that Neil , who was getting used to going to bed at odd hours , couldn 't sleep .
va	4	A troop of soldiers or guards could return at any time ; still , he wished that she were safely inside with them in the big house .
va	4	" I had a feeling you two would come down here , without permission , and jeopardizing the entire household , by the way . "
va	2	Just the usual -- sit still , don 't talk or laugh , don 't fall asleep , no humming or whistling -- " Riki reeled off .
va	1	Mirrors were set into the walls , making the room appear even larger than it was , and dark corridors branched off in every direction .
va	0	The cook wore a broad smile , a snowy apron and held a huge tray filled with plates of rolls , cakes , fruit and fried plantains .
va	0	As tall as Mana was , she had to tip her head up to look into his eyes as he replied , " I can .
va	2	" I do hope it won 't rain before we get to the Palace ; this boat 's cover doesn 't provide much protection -- oh ! "
va	2	She looked around as her voice echoed in the huge room and added , " This isn 't the most comfortable room to work in .
va	2	He looked at her , and she said , " Look , Papi , I 'm not going to scream , or whine , or cry .
va	4	It was set in a country where there was a crystal globe called the Birthright , which protected the people and the lands in some mysterious way .
va	3	The factory was the largest structure in the mean little street , and it had several large , doors set into its dripping , dank walls .
va	0	Miriam , her hopes rising , saw that she had the same brown skin as Mana , the same dark hair , and the same black eyes .
va	2	Come in , come in , it 's beginning to get a bit chilly out here and that 'll do you no good at all . "
va	4	" I have been in the wild many times , maybe not under these circumstances , but I am always aware of my place . "
va	4	They stopped by a small stream that fed into the Orange River where they sat on the bank to cool their feet and wash their wounds .
va	3	It is on the winds and in the living things of the forest , the plants and the animals and all the things that surround them . "
va	1	It has crumbled and withered over time , a fortification long abandoned and now nonexistent , only an outline remaining , but it is there .
va	2	If we cut back across the mountains north of the low hills we would be able to make a short stop to pick up supplies .
va	4	Their path was but a series of broken pieces of earth and fragments of living things once lush and beautiful that were now been subdued and scorched .
va	1	" I will tell you the next time I leave if it will suit you , and I promise not to throw you again . "
va	1	I flew in high circles catching sharp , stabbing flashes of a brilliant light from a point on the ground though I could not locate it .
va	3	He saw nothing other than a shed that was larger than it looked from the outside , its contents as well broken and strewn about .
va	0	" I am afraid though it will take us away from our lands and we will no longer be able to track the black army .
va	3	Their light dimly lit the grounds at the feet of the mountain but enough to let the travelers easily find their way in the darkness .
va	3	You must at that point not speak of any other matters than those questions put to you , even the business you have come to speak of .
va	0	We will take them only a few yards as they are a slippery outcrop and the rain of a few days ago may have made them worse .
va	0	The sun was climbing high , the light bathing them with its warmth and even in the higher trails they were working up a good sweat .
va	4	He quickly made his way back along the forward lines in a more than jovial mood , stopping briefly here and there among groups of tired soldiers .
va	4	The sun was now high in the blue canopy , noontime was approaching and they were all beginning to feel the sting of hunger in their bellies .
va	4	The eyes of the scout reached out in desperation and with one last gasp his eyes rolled up and he too , had failed to escape .
va	0	Although his body was racked with pain , sore and stiff , he was able to distinguish what was torn and battered from what was only bruised .
va	1	His hand reached the hilt of his sword and he drew the blade slowly , quietly , bringing it up and laying it to his breast .
va	4	" Only because this is our homeland have we journeyed so close to this evil , and be assured it is evil pure and simple .
va	0	It would be a good place for a watch as he could prop himself up against the massive trunk and view the access from all sides .
va	3	Without any warning , a hollow , splitting sound broke from his right and the trunk of a large tree fell with a resounding thud .
va	1	The stranger stepped forward , the loose brown wraps from his cloak falling close around his large frame , his forearms clad in bright metal .
va	2	He followed and we collected our trunks and took stock of our situation as we stood in the crowd , isles amid a sea of movement .
va	2	For myself , I found my own curiosity and studies being drawn further south , towards Rome -- the world 's seat of power for millennia .
va	3	Hours were lost upon simple pleasures , and untold minutes were devoted to navigating the den of byways that composed the fantastical labyrinth that was Paris .
va	4	Paintings , gilded chairs , plush carpets and massive four-poster beds , vases and wonders from the East -- we saw all of these in every chamber .
va	0	Suddenly , a tall man approached us through the crowd , and by his dress and obvious swagger , it was plain that he was an aristocrat .
va	3	I was born in that great country a little over twenty two years ago , and most of my short time on this earth has been merry .
va	2	Of course , I couldn 't do this without my own family 's approval , so , filled with wonder , I once more boarded a train .
va	4	My Lilly waited behind me , and after only a moment , the shock registered on my family 's face as I led her forward .
va	4	The great waves of the Pacific will not swallow me , and the bandits of Europe 's alleyways deny me the swift demise I seek .
va	1	" Now , " he spoke , a tiny grin crossing his lips at last , " You 've heard my story , such as it is .
va	3	The Revolution doesn 't matter anymore ; France is back to her old ways , and the two of us are part of it . "
va	3	" Not to distract the two of you from your lovely banter , but three men with every intention of murdering us are wandering this way .
va	3	Entering the home , we were instructed to wait in the vast foyer as the little man ran up the stairs to find his master .
va	4	In the meantime , we must get you three settled in , and I 'll introduce you to my tailor ; he does excellent work .
va	4	Many attendees nodded or bowed to Di Luca as he passed , and more than once , our progress was halted as introductions were offered and received .
va	1	If we 're going the wrong way , I 'm sure it 's just a quicker route this time of night , " I said .
va	4	Of course , being a ceremonial blade , it wouldn 't last long against anything designed for real fighting , but the weapon was reassuring nonetheless .
va	2	Bloodlines are important still , but no one has titles , so it makes it hard to exclude others on the basis of blood . "
va	1	This city would offer us answers ; we would discover , at long last , what the Faith was and why the scoundrels were hounding us .
va	4	Some were brightly painted in shades of blue , but most were covered in modest earthen tones of brown , yellow , and dull red .
va	4	Mercedes , who hadn 't heard this news , turned completely white , and I was half afraid that she would faint before its conclusion .
va	4	Even if the monarchy could be harsh , it didn 't matter -- the kings were God 's elect and to say otherwise was blasphemy .
va	4	Using masks and not at all opposed to violence , these noblemen saw themselves as God 's vigilantes , God 's righteous judgment on a heathen country .
va	3	I thought about mentioning that we saw farms as our train passed through the countryside , but I didn 't think that would be helpful .
va	1	Now , ministers , administers , bureaucrats , military officers , and the like gain their position through skill , hard work , and raw talent .
va	3	He 's a jolly man and quick to throw a lavish party , but he 's not caught up in the social nets of the court .
va	1	A single scarlet stripe ran up the outside of his trousers , and scarlet tassels on his shoulders and his hat waved in the wind .
va	4	The sentry lowered his weapon , knocked on the large door , and swung it open for us as he moved out of the way .
va	2	The Messiah 's message was about loving your neighbor , not subjugating him into poverty or raising up one man above another to rule them all . "
va	4	Exiting the darkness , we continued down the long corridors , turning when necessary , and generally taking the same route we had walked earlier .
va	1	Jacob , a massively dark stain spreading across his uniform 's jacket , fell into my arms , collapsing out of the driver 's seat .
va	2	Poor farmers generally didn 't possess such mounts , but with a prayer of thanks for good fortune , I put it from my mind .
va	2	All the same , images of his back , covered by a blanket of blood with worried monks swarming about continued to fill my mind .
va	3	The jacket , stolen from the unknown Courtier that morning , was too big for him , and it hung limp about his frame in several places .
va	4	Eva had said the estate was three miles down the road , so after a while , we began looking about us for our destination .
va	0	The heads of animals of all kinds dotted the walls , and crossed swords and various foreign weaponry added a martial touch to the space .
va	3	" I can 't tell ; there 's too much blood to see the actual cut , but that can 't be a good sign . "
va	2	It looked bad to us , and having one or two days of recovery isn 't going to fix that -- such wounds don 't heal instantly .
va	3	As before , the town was ghostly silent , and the slight guttering of street lamps was the only indication that life resided within this silent place .
va	0	He stuck out his hand , smiling pleasantly , and I was more than happy to hand over my ticket and be rid of the kindly man .
va	4	The man was pleasing to chat with , and although necessity forced me to keep my words jaded , his company provided for an enjoyable afternoon .
va	3	I finally reached the outskirts of the city and ducked through an open gate just as the guards were shutting down the city for the night .
va	0	We drank lightly as I told of our ragged chase through the pass , the Faith 's manor , and the flight through the darkness .
va	0	Of course , other than a few occasions this week , I haven 't had a chance to practice in a while , " I said wryly .
va	0	" As much as that would remove all my romantic attraction , " I said dramatically , " I suppose it might be necessary . "
va	2	" If you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to find some food , a razor , and a bed in that order . "
va	4	I 've met Eva only once or twice , and from what her father Aleksei says at court , she 's a free spirit . "
va	2	He said this as if it might be an imposition to some , but I couldn 't fathom that ; the common room was simply enormous .
va	0	I was rather taken with his style , and Simon , being both a swordsman and Frenchman , had every published work by the author .
va	4	To make a long story short , a treaty several decades back changed the borderline , and his family 's property landed on our side .
va	0	" Well you said that like it 'd be a walk in the park and not some midnight caper with half a chance of survival . "
va	4	When I saw it though , there were lots of guards milling about , and people were passing to and from the paddocks as well .
va	3	" It 's a long shot , and I didn 't get a long chance to examine it much , but maybe this other one will work .
va	2	" Now which fool do you suppose did -- " I snapped my gaze towards him , and the withering look shut him up instantly .
va	1	In the end , I caught his shoulder in a passing swipe , and he collapsed in utter terror , cries of agony escaping his lips .
va	0	A shot cut the bark from a tree as his side , a naked branch dipped to shade him , and he was swallowed by the woods .
va	0	To Alexandre Dumas , Sir Anthony Hope , William Shakespeare , and all the others : Thank you for walking the path ahead of me .
va	3	In fact , on several times , when testimony was taken about the Faith 's actual assassination , the trial had to pause to quiet the crowd .
va	4	I couldn 't tear myself from the unseen horror , the grasping arms of war that tried to embrace us here , even in the lonely kitchen .
va	3	I clutched him to my breast , vowing I 'd never let him go , struggling to think of a way to keep him from the army .
va	4	Instead of retreating back toward the stateroom , the man wandered the corridors , his eyes reflecting the dull brass and iridescent silver adorning the walls .
va	0	The blade was elegant , perfectly balanced , and finely honed by a Hanoverian craftsman ; it was a graceful tool of life and death .
va	0	* * * * * Ward had collapsed again on the observation deck , a pen in hand , a paper present , and a soul grieving .
va	2	This book is a work of fiction and any resemblance to persons , living or dead , or places , events or locales is purely coincidental .
va	3	The problem with the Dominator was that in order to make the thing fly , its designers had sacrificed much in the way of armor .
va	4	Destro had been standing on the outdoor balcony of his private dining room when his guests arrived and he hurried back inside to greet them .
va	4	" I 'll talk to Aries and see if I can pick and choose at least some of them from the Brigade 's other mortar units . "
va	0	At his command , they threw on their packs and headed out toward the north lawn , which was commonly used as a landing field .
va	0	" A few months back , the Captain 's platoon was deployed to Sierra Muerte along with Colonel Nero 's team and a bunch of infantry .
va	3	That you 've wasted your time on a guy that 's going to spend half his time running around the world in a tank ? "
va	3	Voice # 2 : " If you had not blundered the first abduction attempt , you 'd not be in this predicament , would you ? "
va	0	Though he was far from the senior man in the squad , he was easily the best underwater navigator - and that was saying quite a bit .
va	4	Then he leaned closer to Vulcan and whispered , " Just remember we have a mission and try to keep your pants on this time . "
va	0	Unfortunately , one of them had taken a liking to Huerta and made a point of stopping to harass him at least once a day .
va	4	As soon as they get here , we can brief the entire squad , divide up into fire teams and punch everybody back out . "
va	0	Raven sat by herself , looking surly and aloof , as usual and casting occasional dark looks at Moira , whom she was known to dislike .
va	4	A few minutes later , he was standing beside his command DEMON surrounded by his three Platoon Commanders , Executive Officer and the company First Sergeant .
va	1	Since departing Scotland , Vulcan hadn 't missed an opportunity to demonstrate his chivalry or his manliness , and it was beginning to wear on her nerves .
va	2	Stepping outside , he looked forward , beyond the front of the column , and saw an enormous cloud of smoke rising through the trees .
va	3	When hit , the man reacted to it as if stung , but no matter how many times he was hit , he failed to fall .
va	0	Wry , Vader and Osgood were all in a similar state and were already onboard the gunship , which had been designated as a medevac bird .
va	2	" Okay , hold for as long as you can , " Loc told him , loading grenades into his rifle 's launcher as he spoke .
va	0	This novella is a fictional work and is not meant to portray any persons alive or dead , any similarities observed are accidental and unintended .
va	4	We can never be truly full of what we don 't really want , and so he saw others trapped in this scene , their reality .
va	4	The air was sweet and flying creatures filled the sky , and as he gazed he realised there were other creatures by the lake to his right .
va	4	Finally he looked at his hands , like they were new hands , none can know what he truly saw as he gasped and stood up .
va	0	The camp was not small with tents scattered around a central clearing and some soldiers sat by a fire having a meal , while others played dice .
va	3	It was surprising that such an old race as this was yet to evolve beyond violence , still , their cause was thing that I could understand .
va	4	Their tents were laid out orderly surrounding the centre of the camp and there was a fire where the warriors sat , ate and conversed without words .
va	3	" I am grateful for your wise words Traveller , but I must ask what ... What if we don 't win , what then ? "
va	1	I began to feel myself connect with the planet like I was part of its circuit , its full force flowed within me ; it was invigorating .
va	3	My interface monitor alerted my mind , to the failure in my vessel 's systems ... I must return to the ground , I thought .
va	4	I watched a pair of Sphinx make short work of a few of the armoured soldiers ; with a psychic link their motions were perfectly synchronised .
va	4	I watched as one used his blade to take a man off his feet and I saw a few more headed towards the bigger machines .
va	4	I felt the flow take hold and dropped to the ground ; their weapons left their hands to collect as one large rotating mass above us all .
va	0	With my other hand I reached out and grabbed my spear , wrenching it from its mortal scabbard and I spun with it , spraying blood .
va	4	The force was so great that he not only joined the mass , but also caused the mass to wedge itself into a nearby wall .
va	0	A flash of understanding came to me , I knew where I was and I knew what Tiamat planned and how she wanted to accomplish it .
va	3	Then I saw it , it was big with many parts and it stood vertically seeming to extend into the very centre of the planet .
va	3	Tiamat continued , while I mumbled words slowly releasing the Logos that I had collected , attempting to tear the veil of this dimensional trap .
va	4	" Turn right at the next intersection and continue until you see a warehouse , " he said simply and then the line went dead .
va	0	" I brought you here to explain things to a calmer you , " I heard Adam 's voice as an image of him appeared .
va	1	" Your armour is a good design but it is lacking in some areas , I have modified it to improve your chances of survival .
va	1	Scabbard in one hand , I raised the blade and held it vertically , its point in the air ; I pulled the trigger and it roared .
va	1	I wore the cloak and strapped my new weapon , facing the very normal looking door with a golden handle , considering my new mission .
va	1	I knew where I was and it was definitely not Africa , I thought , as I saw snow falling on the other side of the window .
va	4	" You will not stop me , " General Tani screamed as he jumped out the window and sprouted wings , holding the detonator in his hand .
va	1	It was the day I first met him and my mind drifted ... I looked around me , noticing first the Moon low in the sky .
va	3	I swung to the right and took another off his feet , spinning with the motion I brought my left fist down on his stomach .
va	3	I carried the motion and caught another with the full force of my fist in his stomach , I lifted him and threw him at two others .
va	4	Four people guarded my body but I felt no tension in the atmosphere , it could be because I am not expected to be awake .
va	1	Without hesitating I lunged at the one facing me , knocking his head hard on the side of the van and I grabbed his pistol .
va	1	I pulled my blade back and in quick successions pulled the trigger and brought it down on his head but again it passed through him .
va	3	Do you forget that I know the truth of your existence and that of your mother , Tiamat and that of her father , Kek .
va	4	He hadn 't noticed that Adam had woven a web of energy behind him , until the web came to life in a bright fire .
va	1	I could not simply bring you here and though it is unfortunate you went through what you did , you have greatly helped our cause . "
va	1	It is an obvious ploy by Tiamat to divide and conquer , but notwithstanding she must be found and I am sure Oasis will find her .
va	1	In the midst of this all , a glorious sight is seen ; the King 's champion waged battle against a dozen men on his own .
va	4	With nothing but silence Ezra advanced his new enemy , their blades clashed and the ring of metal filled the courtyard as these two titans battled .
va	2	Now let me present to you a poem , which highlights a portion from one story within the second book of A Tale of Tales , enjoy !
va	4	Constant rejection made even him , in his drunken state , realize that the women of the mead hall weren 't going to respond to his flirtations .
va	2	Soon -- by morning 's light -- you will embark on a great journey , and gods alone know where the road will take you .
va	4	Yet at the end of it all ... whether there are blue skies and long life , or dark shadows awaiting you , I cannot tell .
va	1	Gunnar pitched back his axe -- its bit still dripping with blood -- as he grabbed the short , timid man by the scruff of his neck .
va	4	To the east -- where Gunnar planned to go , were the hundreds of caves , obscured by a dense pine forest full of game .
va	0	As Brand 's eyes further adjusted to the light , he noticed that Gunnar was relaxed , sitting against the cave wall , and sharpening his axe .
va	0	" Now that I 've done as you asked , like a servant , perhaps you can tell me your story , " Gunnar said .
va	1	" Perhaps if we sent you to fight the evil in the Darkling Wood , you could vanquish it with the purity of your voice . "
va	0	It was in a different language -- a thicker , more guttural language -- and the melody was in a mode that Brand had never heard before .
va	4	" Show your face , monster , " Hilda hissed , " Or I shall cleave it from the neck and see it for myself . "
va	2	" If you do not believe me , " Gunnar said , " I 'll kill you , an ' I 'll cut you up . "
va	4	" Henrik , earl of White Wolf Keep , will come with an army and take her by force , " the watch captain explained .
va	4	" I will fight for them , if my lord requires , and serve them until the day I die ... " Brand gulped and hesitated .
va	1	" The boy is not trained in a sword , and the sound of a lute in the darkness will not protect from invading men . "
va	4	" I obey you alone , Your Honor , " he finally breathed as the sounds of screaming and tearing flesh echoed through the hall .
va	1	" Go through every longhouse , " Captain Erik instructed the next morning , wearing his gold-colored armor and carrying a torch in his hand .
va	0	In the stain , buried halfway in the snow , was the mutilated body of a grown man , his arms and limbs gone from his body .
va	4	She may be a whore -- even a common one -- and she might not be the kind of guest you 'd like in our halls .
va	0	" That would take days of hard riding , and we only have one day before he turns into -- " " Don 't say it ! "
va	3	" I admit that it does , " the High Priest said , " and yet , I do not know who you are . "
va	2	But inside , we have some scrapings of food , and guest quarters for a few ; but not enough for all of you . "
va	0	" It 's a long journey in this weather -- and without a fire to warm us , or a daily meal , at that . "
va	1	His actions led to the poisoning of the king 's soul ; his transformation into a monstrosity ; and , in time , his death .
va	2	" -- and they will not be put on the rack or tortured like any of you would be if you crossed the High King . "
va	2	They serve as bodyguards to the baronial family and are sworn to do whatever the lord baron wishes , no matter how outrageous the command .
va	0	Marcus knew himself as a drunkard , a partier , and a man of loose morals ; but he also knew he had a heart .
va	4	" He is a god , and an angry god that lives beneath the others ' feet ... but he is nevertheless a god . "
va	4	She was a proud Imperial matron -- a widow , but the Empress Dowager -- and no one should see her in such a pitiful state .
va	4	They 've been reprinted in The Year 's Best Fantasy and other anthologies , recorded for numerous podcasts , and translated into several foreign languages .
va	3	Just my luck , he thought not for the first time , that the woman I love runs the whorehouse with the city 's prettiest girls .
va	0	But as a student I always fantasized that I would one day be a hermit , alone with God and my many books in the barren hills .
va	0	The sun sinks a bit in the sky and I break halfway up the hill for afternoon prayers and a bit of bread and green apple .
va	4	For it is not my wife that needs your help , but I. " " But her -- pardon me , uncle -- her hoof . "
va	0	I look into a woman 's eyes set in a demon 's face and I stagger backward , calling on God and my dead mother .
va	1	" If I were a good Muslim I would run down to the village now and ... and ... " And what , learned one ?

va	3	Even got chased outta town once when I winked at the wrong girl -- they was sure as could be that I was a mulatto !
va	2	And when it comes to a gang of killers like Parson Lucifer 's , well , I got no problem shooting a man in the back .
va	3	But when I shot that boy four times and he ain 't stopped coming at me , well , that name wasn 't so funny no more .
va	2	The old man gave Ali an irritated look " Y ' know , you and my wife -- you two fucking mystics would like each other .
va	0	It didn 't happen that often -- he was a big man , after all , as experienced at drinking as he was at killing .
va	2	In his day , in his home village , boys that size would be learning to work a blacksmith 's bellows , or to lift a broadsword .
va	4	And a few well-placed hints would let the Legion find this ledger , which would do much to make them less interested in avenging these men .

va	4	They had grown close over the last few years working in the launch tube together and were sensitive to each others ' mood and feelings .
va	2	Also , before you say it , I 'm not going to let your mother spend the night in this small shack with four corpses !
va	0	David gave him the same reaction when told he could not stay at a friend 's house or watch a late movie on a school night .
va	4	Her eyes followed him like a wild horse , but there was no hope for her , it was a wonder she was alive at all .
va	3	He counted the expanding tops of three bright mushroom clouds rising over what must be D.C. in the southeast and two over Baltimore in the northeast .
va	0	From deep in his subconscious , his brain retrieved a distant memory of a military class on what to do in the event of a nuclear attack .
va	1	He continued to stare outside for a few moments as that clinical information briefing replayed in his mind along with visions of blind Hiroshima survivors .
va	2	" Help your mother with water , fill any jug or container you can find and move , we 're almost out of time . "

va	4	He visualized thousands of people above ground coming out and helping each other , but in the process being poisoned by an invisible enemy all around them .
va	3	" Let 's pack up , " he said to the room without turning from the window , " time to get on the road again . "
va	4	Nathan shook his head , " I won 't be alone , and you 'll be there and can cover me if I need help .
va	3	Part of him wanted to rush the men now and try to kill them all unawares , but he decided to take the more cautious approach .
va	1	The region was technically part of the state of Kentucky when it was organized in 1792 , but in practicality remained under Indian control for many years .
va	1	Reggie made his way down the stairs and out the front door of his father 's old house after giving his wife Janice a quick kiss .
va	2	For those of you who do not know , this council is made up of all the county executives and mayors from within the Jackson Purchase area .
va	3	" We estimate that supplies are enough to get us through the next planting and harvest as long as we 're smart and don 't waste anything .
va	0	He also knew he should look for stationary targets and " Mr. Tall and Thin " was now standing still less than twenty yards from the barricade .
va	2	He also saw an older man around the middle of the bridge lying on the ground without moving , evidently a result of Joshua 's second shot .
va	2	Bethany smiled shyly , " Even I can do my small part , although you know I don 't want to have to shoot anyone . "
va	3	Bethany inspected and saw that it was minor but still hissed with exasperation , " That 's exactly what the hell I 'm talking about ! "
va	0	Bethany was dazed with blood on her face , but looked over at Nathan who stood , leaned against a nearby tree ready to take a shot .
va	4	I would like to begin those meetings by telling them what we 're doing and propose recommendations to give them the framework we talked about earlier .
va	3	" The three national guard units are currently at 86 percent manning , thanks to the ability granted at the last Council Meeting to enlist new members .
va	3	" Excuse me , " said Doctor Stevens , " but isn 't that what the National Guard is anyway , at least , in essence ? "
va	3	Butch was a good man ; it was enough for Reggie to know that Butch believed in his plan and thought it best for all of them .
va	4	Anderson raised his hand to cut off the objections , " I know everyone needs sleep , but we can incorporate lack of sleep into our training .
va	2	We can also cut out drill and ceremony , tradition and history , equal opportunity , and my favorite ... ' consideration of others ' training .
va	0	Many of them are already intimately familiar with the ground from hunting , farming , and other more nefarious activities such as poaching or growing marijuana . "
va	0	" We can also eliminate physical training , marksmanship , and other things that they can learn at their unit , or already know . "
va	3	" Sure , I get that and don 't disagree , " answered Anderson , " but I don 't have time for politics or turf battles .
va	4	" Yeah , I 've heard about those camps , " grumbled Anderson , " they grow every day if the reports are accurate . "
va	3	We need to establish order there , that is , medical support , food , water , sanitation , electricity , tents , and information .
va	2	David , with his smoking shotgun , walked over and placed a foot on the dead woman 's shoulder shoving her rudely off his mother .
va	0	" And shut that damn dog up before it draws more attention , " he added as he took off at a run after David .
va	3	He did it he thought out of the necessity to simply survive , but had he somehow forgotten that he was dealing with just a boy ?
va	1	Holding his crying and heartbroken son in his arms , Nathan looked up into the clear stars and asked for ... well , for anything .
va	0	After walking slowly for about a hundred yards , Nathan spied a large dark square compound with a tall fence around it through the dense trees .
va	4	Reggie shook hands and exchanged greetings as he made his way to an empty chair at the head of the table , typically reserved for him .
va	3	It was okay when we thought things would go back to normal , but we all know that just ain 't going to happen . "
va	3	Reggie began to understand with growing horror that this might actually happen and there may be nothing he could do to get out of it .
va	0	Harold looked down and saw a squat muscular man with long scraggly hair and unkempt graying beard in an overcoat looking calmly up at them .
va	4	" The boss will be in here in a minute to talk to you about that and any other questions you have , " replied Meeks .
va	0	Harold sifted through the items and lifted up Nathan 's military identification card , " Says here that you are a Major in the U.S. Army . "
va	4	I got married and the life didn 't really agree with having a family , so I went to night college and then Officer Candidate School .
va	4	Doc , you can keep an eye out as we have more walkers and let us know if someone looks like they need a break . "
va	2	" Just being realistic , " Harold smiled , " only thing to do is enjoy each day and not stress too much over tomorrow . "
va	2	Nathan hoped , and prayed , David grabbed hold of whatever tattered shreds of childhood remained before he plunged into the serious and dangerous world of adulthood .
va	2	" Honey , you 've talked to him and done what you could to let him know it 's okay and that you 're sorry .
va	0	Nathan also saw a raised platform nearby with three sets of rough wooden stocks , one of them actually occupied by a skinny and bruised boy .
va	0	" By all means , go ahead , " said Nathan , still annoyed and trying hard to keep the sarcasm out of his voice .
va	0	" Well , I 'm going to have to explain a little bit of background first , " said Anderson as he pulled out a map .
va	2	" We 're prepared to overlook any charges we could bring against you for desertion of your post at Fort Meade , " said Butch casually .
va	2	Oh , I know I 'll have to report to you or the guy in charge of the JP , but you know what I mean .
va	2	Jim 's smile vanished and he took on a harsh look , " I 'm up to it , don 't you worry , Colonel Taylor . "
va	4	Let me first explain that the JP doesn 't really have the convenience of placing criminal in jails or prisons for any length of time .
va	1	Nathan bristled at being called an outsider and pushed down an angry response , " Sir , we understand ... better than you folks , I think .
va	4	" I meant no offense , but you must know that we 've been having some problems with our electrical delivery and outages are more frequent .
va	2	" It is a dangerous world out there and you are the only ones that I know of with your own functioning supply of electricity .
va	2	" You are forced to support a government of people led by individuals who neither know nor understand anything about sacrifice , duty , or command .
va	4	Sampson stared at him , smirked , and turned and marched off without another word leaving Anderson standing on the border alone between the two former neighbors .
va	4	" What I would recommend is letting me go help train the State Police and then work with them as needed , and when I can . "
va	1	Inside was $ 10,000 in dirty bills in various denominations and a scrap of white paper with two words scrawled on it , " Sorry Bro " .
va	3	Chino , Two Tone , and Jams were part of the 15th Street Posse , a group with connections to larger gangs on the east coast .
va	3	He stopped drug sales , prostitution , and violent crimes and turned the gangs ' illegal activity towards extortion , robbery , and violence against other gangs .
va	4	He finally convinced the guards to prevent her from visiting him due to health concerns for the old lady caused by the stress of the prison .
va	1	Brazen sucked in his breath in surprise and sudden anger , " That 's not what I 'm talking about and you know it ! "
va	2	" Second , I 'm going to pray for you to let go of those sins every day until either I die or you die . "
va	0	But on a standard company organization that leaves two platoon leader slots open and these two are more than capable and they know their stuff . "
va	2	And third , " here Nathan looked hard , " you 're most likely going to have men die under you if you do this long enough .
va	2	He was haunted by the memory of what Noni would have wanted him to do and how he sometimes thought she looked down upon him .
va	0	The other thing that drove him was a 3 x 5 index card in his wallet which he had carried with him since high school .
va	3	The two men who entered walked in and without talking to anyone stalked through the bar checking out the kitchens , bathrooms , and offices in back .
va	1	" I don 't know if this is good or bad , but that 's the county exec and the big man himself , President Reggie Philips !
va	0	" Yes , let 's hear what they have to say , " said Simm , leaning on the table towards Brazen and crossing his arms .
va	3	You may counter that neither does the city of Paducah , but the chances of breaking laws and getting caught by the city are slim .
va	0	In a sense , I can be relied upon to maintain order , because that is what allows me to maintain my control and power .
va	2	" But it does solve a lot of our problems , and we don 't necessarily have the luxury of choosing our allies right now .
va	2	Chapter 8 -- Shut Down Nathan and Harold quickly made their way through the winding corridors of the interior of the enormous Kentucky Dam complex .
va	0	Nathan had thought the same thing , " I don 't think he would do that , he sounded pretty frantic which is rare for him . "
va	0	Harold decided to build housing areas around old camp grounds because those areas already possessed good roads , electrical hookups , and a clean water supply .
va	3	The only way to find the problem is to shut everything down and do checks section by section and circuit by circuit to find the problem . "
va	4	I need time to tell President Philips and General Anderson , maybe they can get a special radio broadcast out before we do this . "
va	3	I have it on good authority that failure to institute the outage now , and conduct the maintenance , could endanger our ability to generate electricity . '
va	3	Anderson was worried about the spy in their midst , but Reggie didn 't think they could give anything away the spy didn 't already know .
va	3	Oh , they would admit that some minor things had changed like not being able to watch Monday Night Football , but nothing of real significance .
va	0	If it was a surprise attack , they would want to maintain secrecy as long as possible which means they would probably only travel at night .
va	3	Joshua wasn 't familiar with the lakes or boating , but figured that it would take them several days at least to travel that far north .
va	2	" You 're also going to have to get a boat at some point to cross over to warn Captain Green , " said Joshua .
va	3	After fueling up the plane , they left the soldiers behind and lifted off without a flight plan , or any other real plan for that matter .
va	4	It was not until later that Beau suspected Teddy 's lack of concern was related to the fact he had been drinking heavily since noon .
va	4	Beau had never flown before and was mesmerized by the sight below him , but probably not as much as those individuals on the ground .
va	4	Captain Green reasoned he could not cover both the Lake Barkley and the Kentucky Lake approaches , and still have men left to cover the southern border .
va	4	My guys can cover the approach from the west and the top of the park , can you cover the east side approach over the locks ? "
va	0	His father had spent most of his youth and weekends up here fishing with his own father or hanging out with friends once he was older .
va	2	" The Tennessee ships passed by their position and they could do nothing to stop them although they got a lot of good shots off .
va	2	Jim turned to David 's position to give him the order to withdraw , but saw nothing but smoke , blood , and dead bodies .
va	3	The man started to grab his weapon off his shoulder , but Beau drew the 9mm Beretta pistol from his holster and pointed it at him .
va	1	He began frantically yelling and waving for his friends to come get in the tank with him and many took off running in that direction .
va	0	Beau had a moment to wonder how it had all come to this so quickly , less than a year ago they were all Americans and neighbors .
va	3	A wide smile crossed his face at the exact moment he was shot , falling back into the tank with blood pouring out of his chest .
va	4	They moved the wheel painfully , and unlike the first wheel , there never seemed to be a point where the wheel overcame its initial inertia .
va	0	He had the units form up on line facing north and set out at a cautious pace while several small patrols ran ahead to gather information .
va	3	He started walking again , but took only a few steps before he had to bend down and spit the awful taste out of his throat .
va	4	Joshua thought and then smiled , " Because they want to keep our forces here facing south instead of moving north to help defend against the invasion .
va	1	Instead of shooting President Phillips , he shot his wife Janice who snuck up behind him hitting him with a cast iron skillet , crushing his face .
va	2	Beau followed her buttocks with his eyes and it took him several minutes to snap out of some sort of hypnosis to look around at the room .
va	2	So I want you to hear me say that I respect the hell out of you and thank you for what you 've done . "
va	2	Oh yeah , I almost forgot , you will work directly for President Phillips , and ... you 're now Brigadier General Taylor ... congratulations . "
va	1	We might mislead them and send the message for success , but their other spies probably know by now that the assassination was unsuccessful . "
va	0	Sampson stopped awkwardly at the window and looked as if he had more to say , but finally blurted out , " That is all .
va	1	The task of establishing this network will be significant and time consuming and the details of my plan will be included in a separate report .
va	3	They were fanatical in their own way , but would never be able to stand up to such troops in the open , at least not yet .
va	3	He told them it wasn 't about bravery , but about killing as many of the enemy as they could without being killed or getting captured .
va	4	Captain Green was seriously concerned about the possibility of friendly fire incidents which is why everyone tied a white ribbon or band around their left arms beforehand .
va	1	Captain Green also sent a runner north to try to pass this information to General Anderson , but no one knew if the message had gotten through .
va	3	He didn 't check to see if anyone was following him but felt confident that he had a line of troops on both his left and right .
va	4	Most did not even know what they were running from , but Sampson 's harsh insistence that they get themselves under control seemed to calm them considerably .
va	4	Chapter 11 -- Cease Fire The reality of the situation hit President Reggie Philips as he walked towards an outdoor tent with the sides rolled up .
va	3	I only ask that you allow those citizens living there the right to sell their homes and move south or grant them full JP citizenship rights .
va	3	Although the retirement was bittersweet , the days back in his little house collecting his thoughts , gardening , and writing in his journals felt good .
va	3	" Let 's start off with the most practical topic of discussion considering the broadcast , the repair of the dam and the return of electricity . "
va	4	The man 's biggest concern is now for the safety of his mother and he hopes his handler did not learn that he has been caught .
va	1	He does not possess any information specific enough to identify these individuals , but we are opening cases and using his information to build subject profiles .
va	2	The radio operators have on occasion picked up bits and pieces of information about something called ' Continuity of Government , ' possibly in Colorado .
va	3	People wanted blood , but they just couldn 't seem to understand that such a road demanded further war or total annihilation of the enemy .
va	3	The tribute paid to the JP had been difficult to stomach , but it was worth it to get the electricity back on and secure peace .
va	0	Paul Campbell was not initially happy about running for the office , or campaigning in the manner that Ethan directed , but what choice did he have ?
va	3	He was just far enough north of the city so he didn 't die instantly , but he did sustain a near lethal dose of radiation .
va	3	They must either come into the city each night and huddle behind the walls , or be content with the fact they might get eaten . "
va	4	There was no way that such a little thing would send her to the far side of Evermore , otherwise everyone would end up there .
va	2	Its thatch roof threw back the moonlight and small windows set high above the ground peered out from underneath it like a boy looking through too-long hair .
va	2	Now the eggs were cooking in the pan , and a pitcher of milk was cooling on the windowsill , thrown open to the cold morning breeze .
va	3	The embers laid out under the tub were dying in the cool wind that snuck through the curtain , but he wasn 't thinking of his bath .
va	2	Then you 'll have to hide your eyes from the world , or you 'll draw the sort of attention you don 't want . "
va	3	It is the spark of Life and the heart of Trust and all those other ideal , unmatchable things : Love , Time , and the rest .
va	3	" It took a full month for me , being rather untalented with Earth , which is what they started men off with in training .
va	1	The thick gold collar around her neck and matching bands on her wrists shone in the starlight , as they did on his own neck and forearms .
va	4	It she hadn 't needed it to keep the rats away from the woodpile she would never have gone near it , much less picked it .
va	1	Once she 'd tried hunting with her power instead : finding prey by sensing Fire in their warmth , hunting with darts or nooses of Air .
va	3	Isn 't a sudden flood that crashes down on you , it 's a slow rising tide that you don 't even notice until you 're underwater .
va	3	Elaina tried the subtle web that would keep them warm without setting the whole thing ablaze , but after failing twice , she let it drop .
va	1	But Healing was terribly complex , a mix of the all the pillars in an intricate and incredibly delicate combination that varied depending on the injury .
va	3	" There 's a house there , " he said and pointed to a tilted little structure tucked into the last stubborn stand of pines .
va	0	His face gave away a lot more of his frustration than his voice , though he was still doing better than she was at faking civility .
va	2	Too late , too slow , too late , too slow , the words were a chorus in her head , chanting out her death .
va	3	Besides , if the way she was gripping that chair was any indication , she couldn 't cast anything too strong , she was too tired .
va	1	-- but she cut him off , " I do deny that it was against his will , or that I have bewitched him in some way .
va	2	He bowed to the young woman solemnly , one palm to his chest , back of the other hand to the small of his spine .
va	4	It didn 't make it easier that Healing required a level of immersion in the injured person 's being -- the healer felt the pain as well .
va	3	All of it hit her at once , and so did the lonely and frightening thought that she was the very last of the Creators .
va	4	He would capture the Falcon and his star would be bright enough to see even in the day , even in the light of the Empress .
va	1	She was riding on a night black stallion on the edge of a sea-side cliff , a boy child with dark hair blowing in the chill wind .
va	0	But it did not stop those that were taking away a little girl , rough hands tangled in her dark hair , dragging her away .
va	0	Or maybe it was because he knew she was unusual that it affected him this way , or maybe it was the Link and his oath .
va	2	They ought to , he had not come to this position by being weak or foolish or binding himself with the petty morals of other men .
va	3	Well , if I thought she would heed my warning I might not , but this will only serve to goad her directly into my trap .
va	4	Before she could blink at him , he was no longer standing , but kneeling beside her , strong fingers closing on the collar on her neck .
va	3	They were approaching a village , its little buildings just barely visible through the darkness , windows casting bright rectangles of light onto the road .
va	3	She didn 't catch anyone staring , but it was hard to look about and keep her grey eyes out of sight at the same time .
va	0	It was an old man , very old , with wild white hair and a hunched back and baggy eyes that almost disappeared under his bushy eyebrows .
va	0	She watched him suspiciously and began doing up the buttons of the coat she wore until the stiff , high collar brushed her jaw again .
va	2	" Once you do that , you let the form do this ... " his hands moved down and out until his palms faced the floor .
va	4	Elaina flushed at the attention , especially with half her legs showing -- exposed to the knee with the white lace hem of her camisole peeking out .
va	3	Cade sold the third horse to pay for the room and then some , so it was just the two of them and their mounts .
va	3	Elaina knew it was still too slow for Cade by the way he kept staring up at the sky marking the position of the sun .
va	0	It was far too hot , and she looked like a fool , but she was well past caring that Cade watched with a hint of surprise .
va	2	Elaina thought it a little odd , but she supposed it was common enough to ask a swordsman how long he 'd had a weapon .
va	4	Cade held back a snort -- if he was able to hear from across the clearing , Darin 's ears were not the motive for his move .
va	2	It is an offer for her protection , nothing more , and if she decides to take enormous offense I do not want to be too close .
va	2	" It was good of you to be suspicious of him -- you can 't trust people the way you are used to , Elaina . "
va	4	" I am the most powerful caster you 'll ever meet it isn 't worth being ordered about like a dog , staying with you .
va	1	The vague surprise on his face was fast fading to stony stillness as she went on , " As if I would flee to you from Darin !
va	4	For a few minutes she didn 't care who he was or what he 'd done -- he was there , and she was scared .
va	2	" He 's so much older , he knew exactly what to do , and I didn 't even know enough to worry about it .
va	1	His passion may be useful , like a rabid dog can be useful against your enemies , so long as it does not bite you first .
va	0	Elaina was no longer frustrated , angry , or sharp , and Cade managed to speak to her much more like a normal traveling companion .
va	0	a bored voice came from the guard 's stand , followed by a worn and rumpled man in a chain mail tunic and half asleep .
va	2	" I don 't know why , but they sent us along as if they 'd not seen a half a hold of smuggled goods .
va	4	Pausing at the door of the inn as if he were fixing his boot , Cade glanced around the street before he stepped out among the people .
va	3	Wait for me by that pile of crates at the bottom of the ramp -- I don 't want you to go up there alone . "
va	0	Elaina reached out for a hammer that lay across the anvil and -- She was jerked to a halt by the collar around her neck .
va	4	The doors and shutters of the houses and shops were the palest blues and greens and lilacs , like a dream of paradise at dawn .
va	3	" If you want to fix the dock , you must see what of it is broken , including the part under the surface . "
va	1	His shoulders did not shake , and he didn 't sob , but tears ran down his cheeks for the second time in as many days .
va	4	I 'm not going to live a half-life , never getting close to anyone just because I might lose them someday -- then they 'll have won .
va	2	Back to the door as if to hold them out , Elaina looked to Cade with wide eyes , swaying with the rocking of the ship .
va	3	" They follow the stars , using them to navigating from port to port so they don 't have to hug the shores like most other ships .
va	2	I don 't know how to lead anyone , and I don 't want to be at sea if there 's a storm coming ! "
va	1	" It 's similar to the Link , I think I found a way to mimic it , but it may hurt as that did . "
va	4	Despite himself , Cade got lost in the worried grey eyes that flickered back and forth between his , searching for an answer to her fears .
va	4	It could have been the warmth of her , so close in the small space , or the way her breath seemed to come faster .
va	3	He didn 't care if it turned out to be the most foolish thing he had ever done , though he didn 't think it was .
va	4	She sat at the foot of the lighthouse watching her brother , nearly eighteen , braiding long strands of sea grass together with nimble fingers .
va	0	What he thinks he knows about what a woman wears under her dress ... but half the court shows up this week in those awful leather things .
va	3	I cannot explain all in a letter , but let it suffice to say that all of my Brothers are no longer united in our purpose .
va	3	For a moment his hand hesitated on the hilt of his sword , but then his gaze flicked to Elaina , who sat in stunned stillness .
va	4	With a concerned glance , she stepped toward Elaina , " And you as well , my dear -- don 't think you 've been forgotten . "
va	4	He never asked for this , never picked me -- it is his right to resent it , and I won 't make it worse .
va	2	The only reason he 'd done any of it was because he had to , had sworn to , was bound to by the Link .
va	4	Riesling was almost that good : he knew men and war so well , his plans often met with remarkably good fortune as a result of preparedness .
va	3	Man or beast , he would deal with it in the light of the fire , not scare it off to lurk in the night .
va	4	Only two of the horse thieves saw them approach , but the light in their eyes to finally recognize an enemy did not last long .
va	4	He was young , one of the recruits , but he carried the long bow of a country archer like he knew how to use it .
va	0	" But there are only two things I know of that can make a man ride like that : a brother or a woman . "
va	3	To his shock , the man in the helmet directing the work only nodded to them with surprise , though most of the workers watched uncertainly .
va	0	It was a crazy idea and an absolutely impossible question to ask with any sense of propriety , but Cade wasn 't about to stop her .
va	3	One thin eyebrow arched at the two of them while he adjusted his grey cloak with the air of a cat twitching its tail at intruders .
va	4	It was not uncommon , with Watchers and their counterparts relying on each other , protecting each other -- they very often married , in the end .
va	3	The rest of his telescope time was spent mapping out likely locations for deposits throughout the solar system but it wasn 't as time sensitive .
va	4	Her relief was interrupted when she realized that the technician was explaining to her , in great detail , what he had done to fix the problem .
va	0	It was perhaps half the average size of a human and its charcoal grey suit looked to be made of interlocking plates of some hard material .
va	2	Considering how far from help our eight colonists are , imaginations will spin this out of control before you can say one term president . "
va	2	Mammoth Cruise Lines Engineering Office , Dodge Island , Miami , Florida January 4th , 2026 " Off to Finland tomorrow , you poor stiff ? "
va	3	" If they want a toilet put in the middle of the casino floor , I 'll put out a rocket to the architects . "
va	3	" If that story takes off , I 'll be out of this stinking job so fast it 'll make my own head spin ! "
va	4	" The last fifty changes have all been over the budget line so I have to take every new one upstairs to get Howard 's autograph . "
va	2	" Hockey could be a hoax for all I know - a bunch of grown men in short pants chasing a puck around the ice .
va	3	Stands to reason ; they want to gauge our technology and the obvious place to ... " Mike had raised his hand , cutting Pete off .
va	0	" Perhaps , Mr. Gray , you could explain the orbital airship concept that your administration has been holding back for the last few years ? "
va	3	We 've given them ten times that in military support but they conveniently forget that when they come calling with their hat in hand . "
va	0	Palm Island Miami , Florida January 9th , 2026 Frank took a pull on his beer and reflected on the changes a week could make .
va	3	It would have no impact on the rival 's launch date but it would almost certainly cost Frank a week that he didn 't have .
va	0	Davidoff finally left the poor sausages alone and stared across the water at Fury , the last ship to come out before the Leviathan class .
va	0	Frank tossed the runner on the chair and quickly bent to check the results in Mr. Jeb 's photo as he ran his fingers through his hair .
va	4	" Must have been something in that bagel , " Frank mused out loud , then seeing the look on Jess ' face he explained .
va	3	" I 'm hallucinating that I 've been flown at twice the speed of sound to chat with an improbably attractive politician about my work . "
va	3	Frank was getting a little tired of the bizarre twists in his Monday and he was trying to throw Jess off her balance a little .
va	2	Sam followed Parnell into the Oval Office through the door from the West Colonnade , the smell of cigarette smoke clinging to both of them .
va	4	" So , now that we need to go to war to preserve the species , he 's going to play a card like that ? "
va	3	Not as an attack , mind you , but every Republican pundit on the talk show circuit will start dropping that little nugget in casual interviews . "
va	2	His countenance held no gloating , just the workaday expression of a man who could round up enough votes to make or break any Democrat legislation .
va	3	Parnell fought the urge to stand , his nerves making him want to pace the floor but it would show weakness and he couldn 't afford it .
va	1	We can 't afford a single moment of delay in developing our military capabilities and that is something the American public can easily identify with .
va	4	It was almost two years before a neighbor read one of their books and learned that the two former agents were staunchly against big government .
va	4	Their unique perspective , looking at government from inside its seedy underbelly , really appealed to many of their neighbors and they soon found themselves fitting in .
va	0	" Seriously , Frank , I 've heard you and your dad complain a thousand times about how the military contractors are always late and over budget .
va	0	Kim and Sarah sat in a pair of comfy leather loungers , Kim grinning like an escaped mental patient and Sarah smiling sympathetically at Ellen .
va	2	" We do get four or five days of snow a year , so it 's not like it 's a tropical paradise or anything .
va	0	Anyway , my point was that I could drink coffee back home , so I 'm not really accomplishing anything extra by being here . "
va	3	" He insists on entering a room first but it kind of starts meetings off on the wrong foot , don 't you think ? "
va	1	" It 's different , I 'll give you that , " Chuck said , as he realized he hadn 't fulfilled his side of the introductions .
va	0	Chuck watched from the head of the table for a few seconds as Frank pulled out a laptop and Kim began setting up a small projector .
va	1	" He always assumes Sam is following him out the door so it never gets closed when Sam stays behind after a staff meeting . "
va	4	Mary tells me it could even have taken in the miners from the Red Flag site as long as they were careful about their resources . "
va	2	Looks like they drove the one missing rover into the mouth of the cave and someone came out for a quick last look before going inside . "
va	4	" I happen to have some openings right now and I need to fill them right away , " he said as he pulled out his phone .
va	3	he asked , knowing full well that the contractor had lost four men in an incident at one of the local bars the previous night .
va	2	Thanks to some willing help from Callum 's young followers , the four men had been provoked into a disturbance big enough to land them in jail .
va	0	" John Henry was the first aviator to reach flag rank and now his descendant will command the first carrier task force in space . "
va	1	" When two groups do as much business with each other as we do , quarrels happen , " he said simply as Ambassador Zhu drifted over .
va	4	" For those of you who haven 't met him yet , Frank Bender is our project manager , " she said as she sat .
va	1	" Taking orbit is one thing , " Gao asserted , " Taking the planet , against billions of citizens , is quite another . "
va	3	" The Indian military would either take them on , toe to toe or they would fall back and just nuke them , right ? "
va	2	" I 'll just try his cell , " she said as she pulled out her phone and slowly strolled away , looking down at the screen .
va	4	She had already suspected that she had been given Callum 's number and was bound to figure it out if her calls kept getting ignored .
va	3	The decision to start in the middle was almost overlooked until Frank had questioned the assumption that they would start at one end of the keel .
va	3	There was nothing uncommon about that and she almost passed them without a word , but then she stopped and took a second look at the group .
va	4	He stepped back a few paces and turned to face the center of the room , obviously aware that he 'd interrupted a private conversation .
va	0	" It 's a state park and it hasn 't erupted in over a hundred and fifty thousand years , so you should be ok .
va	4	The knowledge of iron would have diffused its way to the mainland and spread like wildfire across the entire continent and down into Central and South America .
va	0	He smiled to himself as he watched the contractor work his usual magic , turning Charles Gray from a stuffy administrator into an affable old pal .
va	3	As they headed towards the path that led from one hangar to the next , Frank came to a stop and enlarged that section of the drawing .
va	2	He caught movement out of the corner of his eye and , looking out the window , he saw Frank coming down the stairs of his Gulfstream .
va	4	The three men wandered over to the open ramp but Chuck stopped when they were about twenty feet away and frowned at the wall of the hangar .
va	4	Turning around to scan the large hangar , he was shocked to see the large man five feet away , hurtling at him in full tackle mode .
va	4	He knew the layout of the mining facility as well as anyone on Earth , and his knowledge of the terrain far exceeded any other candidate .
va	4	" Of course you have to come , " the man had sounded as if he were speaking to a dimwit but his smile softened the effect .
va	3	It was more than fifteen times the size of the ill-fated Hindenburg and Frank had cringed the moment the unsettling statistic had come into his mind .
va	0	Brad put a hand to his earpiece before reaching down and activating a series of controls on a long touch-screen that was strapped to his arm .
va	4	Positioning himself on the bottom step , he pushed off lightly and reached up to grab the railing that ran around the upper edge of the staircase .
va	2	You could spend years sifting through garbage but that one flash of insight could save thousands of lives on both sides of a conflict . "
va	4	They began to slow as they approached the barricade on the island side of the bridge , stopping at the seemingly standard distance of angry crowds everywhere .
va	3	The bottle hit the ground , shattering and exposing its cargo of gasoline to the flaming wick of cloth that had been stuck in the neck .
va	3	" Rather than the exciting future that I had planned out , I was stuck in an unimportant little building in a back alley of Marseilles .
va	4	Though many were excited by the idea of dining there , a sizeable proportion were unimpressed with the service after all the trouble of getting in .
va	3	" If this is the only way to get you out of your office , I may have to pull the alarm myself next time . "
va	4	She saw a ship 's bulkhead laying between her and her startled parents , exactly where she would have been walking had she not raced ahead .
va	1	Its nose smashed the outer glass , driving across the Arrivals walkway and shattering the glass wall of the inner side , nearly toppling the status kiosk .
va	4	Picking up the piece of wire , she moved her right hand under her left so she could get at the inbound side of the locking mechanism .
va	4	Then again , he might come back and move us as well , or even use us as hostages in a standoff with the cops .
va	2	" Neither , " Mike got out of his chair and walked over to one of the whiteboards that stood on frames around the central working area .
va	1	" And every now and then it stops and someone ... " Jan came to a halt and everyone felt a tingling sensation dance across their skin .
va	2	It 's almost as if they borrowed a few words of Hopi , maybe a few words of Zuni -- I need to hear more . "
va	0	U.S. Military Academy West Point , New York April 24th , 2027 Sam walked into the commandant 's office with a tablet in his hand .
va	2	While fighting , all of the ship 's aft hangar doors would be left open : a lucky shot could cause a closed door to fail .
va	0	Each nation had provided an officer of equal rank and Mike wasn 't sure whether that was by design or accident but it certainly wasn 't helping .
va	0	" Chances are , you each have a good plan for analyzing the data but you need to pick a direction and go with it . "
va	0	" This is a digital translation that I 'm looking at ; please tell me you have an actual optical recording of the full stream . "
va	3	We 'll lock you up , just to be sure , but chances are slim that anything would survive for centuries without a host . "
va	4	Her nose would be called pointy , her eyes small and unremarkable and her mouth was a thin line set above a slightly jutting chin .
va	3	He figured part of it might be due to his cousin 's impressionist beauty but that was a question for them to figure out on their own .
va	1	As the introductions were nearing the end , a radio chirped to life , initiating a conversation with one of the majors in the small group .
va	4	She dropped the napkins beside the tablet , looking up at the main screen to ensure that she hadn 't lost the view of the interface .
va	2	" I have a thought on how we could show some appreciation for all the lives she 's going to save with this idea . "
va	2	I should have gone to work today and then left tomorrow , he thought , now keenly aware of the police who walked about the station .
va	0	Mike couldn 't suppress a grin as he panned the camera around to show the small group that was rooted to a hangar elevator by magnetic soles .
va	1	A small commercial district was taking shape nearer to the waterfront , as evidenced by the industrial air conditioning and refrigeration units on their roofs .
va	4	He had the feeling this was just a nice prison for more slaves -- maybe not slaves in chains like Cal , but slaves all the same .
va	1	There 's no way off this island for you , unless it 's me tossing a bag of ashes out the back of an Osprey .
va	0	The man turned at the approach and Frank realized that it was his own President ( though Frank had voted for the Republican ... ) .
va	0	One of the ship 's medical staff had shaved his head before stitching his wound and it was a scar that Mike would always remember fondly .
va	4	Just like the army used ENIAC for the same thing in the forties , she realized , except it wasn 't done in real time .
va	4	Rob , promoted to the army rank of second lieutenant , was at the backup unit , two hundred feet forward in the secondary command center .
va	3	The thrusters began to push the heavy ship into the center of the path so that the transmission they were about to send wouldn 't arouse suspicion .
va	3	" The captain of that ship may have figured out our little trick in time to save himself but not in time to save the rest ? "
va	1	He felt strange and couldn 't quite put his finger on it until he saw one of his men climbing up onto a higher catwalk .
va	2	The two men rolled their bricks of C-4 into long strips and stuck them on the wall , roughly approximating the shape of a door .
va	4	Her full armament , including her four 250mm forward guns , continued their silent fire in a desperate attempt to soften the ground before impact .
va	4	Without a planet wide magnetosphere or even much of an atmosphere , solar radiation on the day side was several times the exposure in Earth orbit .
va	3	" I think everyone in there should start to suit up , " Gus replied , still staring up at the sky but seeing nothing .
va	0	It was important to ensure the various avenues of approach allowed for logistical support and that was Mike 's main reason for being on this ship .
va	0	He reached up just in time to avoid crashing into an overhead tray that carried cables and wiring along the upper part of the payload compartment .
va	2	Within seconds , two men from each platoon began to work their way out from the circle of men , fanning out from the main body .
va	0	The man had a camouflage pattern of red and orange squares and an American flag on his shoulder embroidered in the same colors as his uniform .
va	0	" Our battalion reserve company is really nothing more than a slightly augmented platoon , " he began , indicating his men with a wave .
va	3	The other two sections of the platoon would then move forward across the stony valley to the next crest , taking up new firing positions .
va	3	They had spent months in zero gravity so the low gravity of this planet wasn 't as much of a treat as they had expected .
va	0	A soldier ten feet away from them had raised up to a firing position and was almost instantly thrown back , shot in the head .
va	4	Even on Earth , they had a more muted sound than heavy artillery but , here on Mars , the thin atmosphere made them barely audible .
va	4	He placed a boot on its chest and fired a short burst into the creature 's torso before stepping back to look at the enemy officer .
va	3	Almost a quarter of the Vulcans in the fleet were taking it in turns to fire on the target for a few seconds at a time .
va	3	The enemy position was a horror of warm body parts but there were still at least five or six still alive and trying to fight .
va	4	" I 'm sorry , it 's just hard to believe that you 're here , that she 's going to have a normal life . "
va	4	The grenade detonated , sending a shower of fragments out of the hole and the second man was the first to drop into the bunker .
va	4	From a height of four hundred feet , the missile angled steeply downward to slam into the thin armor on the roof of the enemy turret .
va	0	His men gathered around him as he walked , slapping him on the back and congratulating him on his heroic defeat of the last tank .
va	2	" Of course , we could have called in some Vulcan rounds and pulled back into cover , but this has a lot more flair ! "
va	3	The big sergeant let the helmet drift and tried to pull him closer so they could talk quietly but the man was having none of it .
va	3	It slowly rotated out of view and he thought little of it as he approached until the man 's head rotated out several inches into the companionway .
va	4	" Well , you wouldn 't be the first person to claim they 've cornered the market on God 's will , " he remarked casually .
va	3	" Jack , our public stand at the moment is that the U.N. is our best friend , but we all know what they 've turned into .
va	4	" The preliminary reports from the tech teams indicate that the physics involved in the captured engines may be very close to existing but obscure theories . "
va	4	As they approached the door , it opened and there he was , a cane in his left hand and a smile on his face .
va	4	The boy had passed their test : he had survived the seven days and was therefore a true son if the Empress would have him .
va	0	That living Seventh Child shall seek to inherit the Kingdom of the Veil , and should he claim his right , all your strength shall fail .
va	4	The Prince 's heart stopped dead for a beat , and when it started again his chest felt as though it were being squeezed by a vice .
va	4	As a member of the Most High , she was allowed in his presence , but not allowed to look him in the eye unless permitted .
va	1	He began to walk again , slowly at first , but then more quickly until he was nearly running , the Guardians following close behind .
va	4	" Yes , my Prince , " the captain responded , " she left this for you and commanded you read it before entering . "
va	4	Darkness swirled in on him , and the last image he had was of the inside of a sack , sewed to look like a tablecloth .
va	1	It was a forest clearing , of that he was sure , though he 'd only seen pictures such as this in books and dreams .
va	4	Who else would have the audacity to do something of that magnitude in defiance of the Empress , the proper ruler of all of Lucia ?
va	2	I found him unconscious , left to die from his wounds by a group of the Empress ' men at the bottom of the mountains .
va	4	But then the man shook his head once more and actually stepped forward to rest the point of his blade against the Prince 's chest .
va	3	She looked at the Prince -- and not just at his face , but at his clothing as well , his chafed wrists , his dirty hair .
va	1	" The entire Empire will be looking for me ; they will find me , and you will die slowly and in excruciating pain for holding me .
va	4	They towered up into the sky , nearly as tall as some of the buildings in Lucien , and they left him dumb and awestruck .
va	2	He 'd stumbled over a floor that was not stone or packed dirt but a mixture of soil and grass and growing things - things of wonder .
va	4	The two Exiles talked softly to one another , in large part ignoring the Prince but occasionally glancing over to be certain he wasn 't making trouble .
va	2	" You know what 's funny , " said the girl , " is that I was aiming for your leg but you rolled over .
va	4	He thanked the Empress that he had received rudimentary riding lessons for visits of state , or else the day would have been even worse .
va	0	The pain made him breathe in sharply through his nose , and he was only just able to keep a gasp from escaping past the gag .
va	3	He may have convinced himself that it was a plot by others , but you and I both know that the signs point to the Empress . "
va	1	They had camped near a running stream that night , and the Prince was cold enough without receiving another dunking in the name of good manners .
va	3	He shot a surreptitious glance at the two Exiles from under his hood as best he could , and saw that they had noticed nothing .
va	3	The Prince stood and motioned for the man to halt , pulling himself up to his full height and assuming the stance of a Prince .
va	4	Besides brief glimpses , the Prince was only able to track her movement by the shocked cries of the men she came upon like a vengeful spirit .
va	2	With sudden strength pounding through his limbs , the Prince raised the dead man 's sword and danced into the middle of the onrushing group .
va	3	But , undaunted , the Watchman continued forward , swung its sword high overheard , and brought it down on the Prince 's blade , shattering it .
va	1	He only succeeded in inducing a huge coughing fit , his lungs burning as if he had pulled in a breath of fire instead of air .
va	3	it screamed , the ghoulish voice twisting the words into a scream of such ripping , throat tearing fury that no living thing could have uttered it .
va	3	The Watchman dropped like a marionette with its strings cut , and the Prince felt the small wavering drop of life it had left in it disappear .
va	4	The Prince peered up from under his hood at the backs of the two Exiles , and felt a strange pang deep in his chest .
va	2	But nothing he told himself stamped it out completely , and as the day wore on he was lost once more in a mire of confusion .
va	0	Privately , he had always assumed it was part of the Raven Talisman , or more specifically because of what happened when he took a life .
va	0	The girl certainly didn 't , not after what had happened with the Death Watch , how he had allowed them to ambush the three of them .
va	4	The Prince watched as the girl 's anger winked out and was replaced by the cold , dispassionate mask she wore more and more often around him .
va	2	But I wish to help you ... and if you give me something to do , you will see that I can be counted on .
va	1	And yet , peace of mind did not descend on him , and he spent the night , once again , trying and failing to find sleep .
va	0	He felt a drop of blood crawl across his skin and fall to ground , and suddenly he realized he truly was afraid for his life .
va	4	" It ' s been too long since I ' ve had some fresh meat -- I 'm off to hunt , " he rumbled .
va	4	Before seeing the big man fight , the Prince would have found the sight of the small sling in the hands of the giant quite amusing .
va	1	His vision had gone red around the edges , and his anxiety , frustration and anger had formed into a hard , twisting fist in his gut .
va	4	The Prince wasn 't sure what to make of this , but as he remained unbound he told himself it was none of his concern .
va	0	He bent and reached for one -- Searing pain raced through his hand , up his arm and into his head as he grasped the hilt .
va	4	He staggered back several feet and fell to the ground , watching in alarm as the dagger smoked in the grass where it had fallen .
va	0	He always did what was right , and such fury as creased his features was reserved only for those who had violated his moral code .
va	1	He let his connection to the Raven Talisman fade and finally cut off , and the markings on his shoulders and back grew cold once more .
va	2	The Prince did so , his boots treading on a soft rug - a plain brown color that might be seen in the most humble of houses .
va	1	Two golden daggers , points down , were hung by large nails on either side of a window in the building in front of him .
va	3	The hole was large and circular , just slightly shorter than he was and wide enough for him to stretch out an arm to either wall .
va	4	The men were all in long robes , decorated with the colors of their house or perhaps the colors of the Prince to which they were sworn .
va	4	He pushed against the side of the alleyway , hiding in the shadows , as the girl , even more stone-faced than normal , crossed the street .
va	4	Suddenly he remembered the sound of crashing metal as he 'd descended the wall and he knew then that she had followed him and incapacitated the guard .
va	4	" By following the path myself , " the Prince said , speaking quickly but doing his best to keep what was left of his composure .
va	4	The girl didn 't respond , but the Prince felt her hesitate for the briefest of seconds before attacking the lock again with renewed vigor .
va	2	The noise of a far off grate swinging open came from outside the door , and then sounds of feet tramping across a corridor above them .
va	3	Do not turn your back on us , who are trying to save your life , the same way that they have turned their backs on you .
va	4	She simply stood there and examined him , her face cold and dispassionate , but her eyes blazing almost brighter than the torches along the wall .
va	4	A number of men rounded the corner , some dressed in the rough black homespun of the Searchers the Prince had seen upon entering the lair .
va	4	Besides , soon we will be followed in earnest no matter what we do , and there will be no chance for the comfort of a fire .
va	3	He continued to stare at the ground , trying to count leaves , trying to set his mind on autopilot , trying to stop himself from thinking .
va	0	" I was told later that what she did was called delving , that she was examining me for the qualities of a Blade Master .
va	0	" Not with this curse around my neck , " he said quietly , fingering the black marks over his shoulders through the cotton of his shirt .
va	3	Ironically , as Leah pointed out to him with a smirk , it was the Prince 's fault they couldn 't travel the main roads .
va	1	Two exiles being hunted was not an uncommon thing , and they were trained in and accustomed to passing unnoticed and had many times before .
va	1	" I did the prep work , since I enjoy doing it , " the big man rumbled , " but the sewing is up to you .
va	3	It was one thing to strike him in combat , but to strike him in such a way , unprovoked -- that he would not let go .
va	0	The Prince felt chills go up and down his back , and also the heat of embarrassment and shame , knowing that she had guessed his thoughts .
va	4	The Prince hesitated before responding , trying to see if she was going to mock him , or in some way degrade him for using the Talisman .
va	0	The Prince slowly realized that she was trying to have a genuine conversation with him , and was so taken aback that he spoke hastily .
va	0	He was angry , and in his anger the guilt and shame of not doing what they wanted or thought was right burned up and disappeared .
va	3	" Then prove it , " the Prince said , adding a biting , taunting twist to the words that he had learned from Leah .
va	2	We can use staves if you want to find some likely looking logs , or practice swords if you can find some good branches . "
va	1	" Once she is in one of the capital cities she is disavowed , " the big man said , his voice heavy with despair .
va	4	He set off at a run , his feet digging deep trenches in the soft ground as he shot through the glen with inhuman speed .
va	0	Leah , eyes wide and staring in shock as the captain fell off his horse right in front of her , was in the right hand column .
va	4	His eyes were closed , and his entire body was shaking , each and every muscle jumping , bunching , contracting , releasing only to tense again .
va	0	He slid off of the litter , and let out a small groan as a hundred aches and pains suddenly came crashing down on him .
va	0	He hadn 't had the opportunity to thoroughly wash himself since he 'd left the Fortress - he , who had taken sometimes two baths a day .
va	0	I am a Prince of the Realm as long as I bear the Raven Talisman , and I cannot turn my back on my responsibility . "
va	3	It was so far away that the Prince knew he shouldn 't be able to sense it : a bright point of life , coming toward them .
va	3	I was taken out of the crowd , brought to the center of town , and whipped with a lash by the Prince of Lions himself .
va	0	The trail was leading him well up into the mountains , high enough that the wind whipping past him cut straight through his layers of clothing .
va	4	The Daemon reared back and turned , a dazzling white dagger sticking out of its neck , just below the edge of its crown shaped helm .
va	1	And then , with a final heaving cry , the elemental monster exploded into a thousand shards of ice that went flying in as many directions .
va	2	" No , " he responded , " and you 're not going to get much farther on those horses so the normal route is out . "
va	4	His physical strength was matched only by his force of will -- and he had never been defeated on the battlefield in an open fight .
va	2	" When the metal is forged , the first person to touch a drop of their blood to the Anchor becomes linked to it . "
va	0	She can 't make it dance or anything , but she can make it do things that no normal dagger would be able to do .
va	3	The blade was oddly bright , almost shining as it took in the smallest hint of light , amplified it , and threw it back .
va	3	" It 's light enough so you don 't truly feel it , and it 's good to train with a bit of extra weight anyway .
va	3	And as time wore on , it became slowly but shockingly clear that the Prince was holding his own against the giant , strength met with finesse .
va	2	" I am not a runaway from the families of the Most High who has come to you with information , as has been reported .
va	1	the Prince cried back , mounting in a single bounding leap onto his horse , surprised to find how easy it was to move in the armor .
va	2	" Not my fault , " the Prince said , shifting from foot to foot , his hands wringing each other over and over again .
va	0	The captain turned to make his way back to his post , and Leah grabbed the Prince by the arm and pulled him along after her .
va	3	He coughed and felt something salty and metallic in his mouth ; he spat it out and realized , dumbfounded , that it was blood .
va	1	But then the Daemons arrived , with spiked morning stars swinging viciously back and forth in their hands , each the length of two men .
va	4	The Prince moved to the bed of rags , his wound sending little shocks of pain down his side every time his left foot hit the ground .
va	3	He gritted his teeth together , taking it on faith that this woman wasn 't trying to kill him even though it felt that way .
va	4	The street was a mess of people running here and there , belongings scattered across the broad boulevard that ran around the mountain up to the keep .
va	4	" No , " the Prince responded , " but if they 're up high enough , close to that cliff , it will be easier .
va	2	You know your brother : once the scent of blood is in his nose , he won 't stop while there is anyone left standing . "
va	1	As if on cue , a sharp , piercing barb dug into his ribs and he gasped in pain as red spots danced across his vision .
va	3	There was another scream of pain , and the creature brought down its iron mace with such strength that it left a crater in the ground .
va	2	The Prince took off running on the top of the buildings , jumping from roof to roof , as fast as his feet could carry him .
va	3	The Ox Talisman , for its part , continued to pulse with a fiery red light , beating in time with the giant 's heart .
va	1	The first man recited it for him in the sing-song voice of a bird : The Raven shall kill the Ox The Kin will gain a throne .
va	1	Resting in a dark corner behind the organ , a young boy named Rift spins a small , wooden box between his thumb and index finger .
va	4	His lovely Princess has shied away from a life of politics , and he has never needed her beauty and natural charm more than now .
va	4	Resting listlessly in the only place he can feel at ease , Rift watches the rolling puffs of dust twinkle in the last of the days light .
va	4	The reeds on the small plateau overhead seem to hum a blissful melody while the cattails beside the bridge knock on the dry wood rhythmically .
va	0	" We 're not in , " the girl on his right starts , clamping her hands over her mouth as Rho shifts his glance to her .
va	1	Oblivious to his approach , Rift is taken by surprise when one of the boys sneaks up behind him and snatches the music box away .
va	1	The pain and humiliation is too much for Rift to handle , curling into a fetal position and waiting for the children to lose interest .
va	0	A shriek of pain echoes through the trees as the plant whips him back and forth through the air before launching him into a nearby tree trunk .
va	4	Even if he could summon the courage to return to Hyrule Field in the dark , he couldn 't find his way if he tried .
va	4	Searching for a way out , he feels a rush of air whip past his head and realizes he is being fired upon from multiple directions .
va	4	The ground itself is nowhere to be found beneath the intricate tangle of branches and vines , holding strong beneath the fine mist pressed against them .
va	4	The large room is impossibly quiet , and the interior is equally pristine , the stone floor and walls appearing as if they are immune to decay .
va	4	An alluring brassiere matches the red texture of the pants as well as the scarf tied beneath their matching ponytails , concealing everything below their intense eyes .
va	2	Striving for the unorthodox , the young man scoops a low swing , knowing it will be easily deflected and appear to offer an opening .
va	4	Behind her golden bangs , her red eyes begin to study her new prey , angrily slashing at her courageous hero in sudden bursts of speed .
va	0	Throwing his large cloak into the air , the man eludes a wayward stab from the ninja while parrying a heavy swing from her ally .
va	4	The unintelligible glyphs and symbols continue to spread outward , projected into the open air around the helm , charging up for some unknown purpose .
va	3	The dark man 's boots hit the soft dirt with rapid crunching noises as his eyes become entranced with the intoxicating wonder of the Triforce .
va	1	Never giving up for even a moment , the man in green pulls his bow from his back , lining up an arrow with its target .
va	4	The worst day of his life seems as though it will never end , the screams and blasts of light above paralyzing him with fear .
va	1	A power struggle of cataclysmic proportions ensues , the divine light colliding with the dark energy , blasting pulsing waves of intensity and color in every direction .
va	1	Lost in the dark blanket of his mind , he subconsciously yearns for his mother 's warmth , having spent so many nights shivering himself to sleep .
va	3	Rift thinks out loud , the influx of information distracting him from the fact that there is a voice in his head that isn 't his own .
va	1	Once again , the dim blue triangle fills his vision , and succumbing for only a moment , he quickly sets his mind back to the task .
va	4	Several large , decaying tree trunks have entrances carved into them , but the potential of dangerous creatures inside is enough to quash Rift 's curiosity .
va	3	" I don 't want any trouble , I just need to get through here , " Rift admits , desperate to avoid any confrontation .
va	1	Below is a disgusting swampland , the pools of water slowly churning as the whirlpool drains through some small cracks at the lake 's bed .
va	4	" Anytime , " she chirps , a sincere sort of joy taking over her tone every time Rift shows even the smallest amount of gratitude .
va	0	Her hand latches onto his , and he swings back upward , sailing all the way to the platform in front of the door with ease .
va	2	Stopping for a moment , he ponders how he will open such a heavy door , the wooden monstrosity obviously taxing its rusted iron hinges .
va	4	Without warning , the entire temple jumps downward , a huge wave of water pouring into the room through the large hole in the ceiling .
va	0	He is a handsome young man who was always eager to assist in any manner of calamity involving the town , even as a boy .
va	3	" He has a good heart , but he is not fit to rule , " he points out , taking Zelda 's hand in his own .
va	2	" My daughter , you are the only one who can carry on our bloodline , less the kingdom fall into another civil war . "
va	0	Ganondorf 's evil grin flashes through his mind , then Zelda 's lips , sweet as nectar upon his , though he quickly stifles the thought .
va	3	" We better get going before the sun sets , " Navi points out , already floating away from the town to hurry Link along .
va	3	Climbing atop one of the pillar bases that still stands , rift spots a small chest at the far end of the room upon a pedestal .
va	3	Still , the beast knocks Rift to the ground , snarling and snapping at the boy 's head while he struggles to push it away .
va	1	Rapidly combining his strikes in imperceptible movements , Rift ducks in and uppercuts the animal 's furry chest , sending it flailing into the air .
va	4	Spiked down like a volleyball , the defeated animal plummets into the swamp water far below , hitting the surface of the bog with a large splash .
va	0	Suddenly , a massive span of the bridge falls , the path lost all the way to the archway resting upon solid ground a distance ahead .
va	4	Landing with little more grace this time around , Rift tumbles head over heels through the blue grass before sliding to a stop on his back .
va	4	The large clearing on the other side has grown dark , the massive tree seeming to yawn endlessly while the insects throughout the forest become increasingly lively .
va	2	The mighty coliseum looks as though it would house a battle ground for gladiators , but its true purpose is nothing more than a glorified prison .
va	4	He had been wounded a thousand times , but the Sword of Sages impaled his very soul , inflicting him with a wholly new sensation of pain .
va	3	She thought it best to turn her back on the world of light forever , but fate has offered her a second choice on this particular night .
va	3	He must gather what information he can to unravel this mystery , and with a little luck , he might just merge the two realms after all .
va	0	Regret gradually transforms into sensational anger , and the dark lord 's hand snaps shut like a bear trap , crushing the mask to pieces .
va	3	King Zora rests with a hand to his forehead , the stress of the crisis afflicting the kingdom beginning to get the better of him .
va	4	A sleeveless purple dress covers her animated form , an oversized witch 's hat concealing most of her dark green hair hanging down in pigtails .
va	1	The most curious feature of all , an ancient lantern chained to his waistband swirling with confined souls is partially visible through his open coat .
va	4	" I 've never seen that man around here before , " she starts , still stunned by his ability to see right through her disguise .
va	4	Give your father my regards , " Maple smiles , still unconvinced the daughter of a farmer could come up with so much coin for a cure .
va	3	The last of the day 's light seeps beneath the mountainous west slowly , the cloudy sky advertising the dark night that is to follow .
va	1	A small gust of wind pushes a loose strand of red hair across Link 's face , but he makes no effort to bat it aside .
va	4	Moving down the steps , Rift finds himself in a deep ravine of stone and sand , the structure undoubtedly submerged as well in a distant memory .
va	0	Taking a defensive stance and backing toward the door , he is immediately cut off by a pair of giant crabs smashing their way into the room .
va	4	Rift 's eyes dart from one ugly visage to the next , his head on a swivel , prepared for the inevitable attack from any direction .
va	0	A tremendous clang sounds , like a hammer hitting an anvil , and the man 's grip holds true while the sword is launched backward .
va	3	Peering through his crossed arms , Rift is dumbfounded by the strength of his armor , but still knows he is outmatched should the fight continue .
va	0	" You 'll have to finish him , " Mai warns , fairly certain the boy doesn 't have what it takes for such a task .
va	2	" No you 'll just laugh at me again , " she stubbornly points out as they move out of earshot of the defeated hero .
va	3	The cells themselves are a pathetic testament to security , only a collection of iron bars spaced just tightly enough to prevent most from slipping through .
va	1	Seizing the sage of spirit by the throat , he clamps his hand shut like a vise causing the entity to burst and dissolve simultaneously .
va	3	Reflecting the sun 's light in a beam twirling to the ground , the medallion of spirit is snatched out of the air by a dark hand .
va	4	Din 's control has left him for now , but Ganondorf fails to discern the difference between his actions , and those willed by his deity .
va	4	Even fewer paths lead to happy endings when greed , power , lust , loyalty , and the greater good are all thrown into the mixture .
va	1	Passing through the northern district , Zelda hears an angry woman shouting just before a small group of young children round the corner in a hurry .
va	3	A subtle flick of her wrist summons a small , magic barrier in front of each of the children as they attempt to scatter in different directions .
va	1	A young boy sits on the steps descending from the back door in a trance , staring at a broken wooden sword resting in his hands .
va	1	He mocks another young boy while prodding him with his sword , and then he is sitting in a stream , rocking himself in the dark .
va	1	" They took Ona first , " he practically mumbles , the sight of the flailing girl being pulled into the ground flashing through his mind .
va	4	Deep down , she wants to stand where she stands now , many days down the line , and witness the brighter day she 's promised .
va	3	It takes such unbelievable effort and patience to build this sort of trust , and a single blast from a war horn to destroy it completely .
va	1	Wasting no time , the skull kid claws both hands into the earth , kicking dirt up behind him like a bull preparing to charge .
va	1	Skipping to a stop in a barely conscious stupor , the skull kid scarcely notices Link prying the gauntlets from his arms before reclaiming his ocarina .
va	2	Cocking his head to listen , the boy doesn 't notice the pair of humanoid water forms climb up and out of the pools behind him .
va	4	Now significantly smaller in size , they each dance across the surface of a nearby pool , absorbing all the liquid they need for another offensive .
va	1	The marine twins have no intention of hitting him with a knockout punch , but instead aim to wear him down until he cannot go on .
va	3	Starting up the staircase , the boy 's aggravation increases as the button pops right back up , slamming the door shut and ending the spectacle .
va	4	Opening both the portal he aimed at earlier , as well as the default one beneath him , Mai feels exceptionally proud watching Rift soar back upward .
va	2	Proceeding through the double doors without a hitch , the flowing water overhead occasionally splashes downward provoking Rift to habitually pull his hood back over his brow .
va	2	The sort of motherly compassion of helping a toddler up a short staircase when their legs are just too short to climb on their own .
va	4	Suddenly , a third glyph reveals itself beneath him , the elaborate pattern seeming to burn itself into the limestone permanently just as the others did .
va	4	Almost seeming bizarre considering the events up until now , a steady rainfall commences , all the water returning to the ground from which it first migrated .
va	1	Without a word , the shadow of Link draws closer , his slow , purposeful steps closing the distance faster than the boy would prefer .
va	2	Skipping off the surface of the watery floor , Rift rolls to all fours as he recoils , scowling at the steadily approaching shadow through angry eyes .
va	1	Knowing the boy is waiting for him to make the first move , Dark Link advances to his ideal range before stopping in his tracks .
va	4	Simmering all around him , he can feel the weight of the pelting raindrops beating down upon his back as the shallow pool is steadily animated .
va	1	Safely dropping a short distance back to what is quickly becoming a pool of death , Rift spots his nemesis already dashing toward him with bad intentions .
va	0	A mixture of frustration and panic charges through him as several yellow crystals fall nearby , the walls of the dome falling away as the temple collapses .
va	0	Releasing his sword for the moment , Dark Link catches the blade after a single rotation overhead , cutting diagonally downward in an impossible display of skill .
va	1	Leaping into a furious sprint , Rift quickly discovers his newest piece of armor has drastically increased his running speed in addition to his jumping potential .
va	4	His need for oxygen reaching critical mass , he kicks off the stone , rocketing him forward as the boulder is blasted to pieces in his wake .
va	1	Kicking and thrashing through the weightless darkness , the only thing he is certain of as his consciousness leaves him is that he didn 't make it .
va	0	Unraveling from his rolling form a safe distance away , Link glares back at the entrance to the city , awaiting Ganondorf 's next move .
va	2	The combo continues with a lunging punch to the torso , sending the warlock back a step before Link rolls forward into a heavy uppercut .
va	1	Crouching into a solid base , Link suddenly explodes with force , tearing through the chains and rolling toward his opponent to finish the fight .
va	4	The brief gust of wind throws Zelda 's tangled , uneven hair to the side , and a look of contempt overtakes her brow in the torchlight .
va	1	An outline of a glorious bow forms in Zelda 's hand , an arrow of blinding light appearing the moment the string is pulled taught .
va	1	Inside the castle , a beastly man with dark skin stalks the halls , and though she doesn 't understand why , she is terrified of him .
va	4	Grabbing her by the hair he leads her to the large bed in the center of the room , throwing her onto the mattress angrily .
va	4	The younger children cry loudly despite the shushing adults hurrying them along , the citizens all but completely depleted of morale in these trying times .
va	4	A collective salute signals her orders have been understood , and with that she turns to find Link leaping atop his horse in a fluid motion .
va	0	" He 's a killer , Link , " she reveals , the thousands upon thousands who have fallen to his blade flashing through her mind .
va	0	A maniacal laughter echoes across Hyrule Field as the ninja slowly absorbs the fire into himself , a blinding orange glow emanating from beneath his hood .
va	0	Reaching back in after the near miss , Link rips his blade back out of Garo 's chest , barely managing to deflect the next attack .
va	3	You can 't kill ' em with elements you know , " he points out , stumbling a step as he turns to face the charging ninja .
va	3	A distinct rumbling sounds from beneath the earth , and moments later the ground beneath the four headed monstrosity begins to crack and split apart .
va	1	" You will join your ancestors this night , " Garo adds , prompting Geist 's vision to wander to the lantern hanging from his waist .
va	2	A half dozen of the glowing projectiles spiral around his outstretched arm and spread outward , forming a loosely knit sphere around the approaching foe .
va	4	" And so I die , leaving no corpse ... That is the way of the Garo , " he concludes with a sinister tone .
va	1	Rift nervously jokes while shaking his vibrating arm , ducking to the side at Mai 's command as Link bashes the wall with another furious punch .
va	1	Seeing his foe has significantly increased his agility , Link charges back into the village at ground level , carefully monitoring the boy 's location .
va	4	In a moment of uncharacteristic anger , the hero feels a need to chase the culprit , Garo 's warning of failure still drifting through his subconscious .
va	0	The murmur of conversation as well as the increasing sound of rainfall fades away as he is transported to the familiar training ground of translucent white surroundings .
va	1	I finally had my story , but I lost everything to obtain it , " he pauses , the painful memories beginning to affect him .
va	4	I had the blood of a hero charging through my veins , but my fate was never to be the slaying of a grand evil .
va	2	Placing both hands to his brow , it becomes obvious he is mourning some kind of loss , but his anger quickly overshadows his sorrow .
va	3	" Sorry about before , " Link starts , sitting on the ground behind a long , stone table in the center of the room .
va	3	Inside the heart of the volcano , the boy almost instantly begins to pass out , but Mai promptly throws the necklace over his head .
va	3	" Alright , " he nods , stepping to the ledge and squinting past the sharp pillars of rock attached to the path far below .
va	0	Blasting up through the cracks in the earth , the lava pours out in a specific shape , gradually forming a rectangular cage of molten liquid .
va	1	" You 're really pushing it today , " Rift sighs , hiding a smile when his comment provokes an uncontrollable giggle from his companion .
va	3	Secured at the waist by nothing more than a thin rope , the slit continues down the side all the way to base of the thin material .
va	1	Quickly regretting the stylish evasion , his back is seared through his cheap clothing , the blade piping hot after being driven into the sizzling ground .
va	0	Suddenly appearing atop the boy 's shoulders , she points at the fallen combatant with a mocking demeanor while palming Rift 's spikey hair for balance .
va	3	Finally relenting , it returns to its passive stance , burrowing its bottom jaw just beneath the surface as its fangs recede back into the mimicked door .
va	3	With a casual twist of her wrist , the door swings open revealing another hall of molten white , turning right just inside the doorway .
va	3	" At first I didn 't want to find out , but suddenly I do , " the Goddess proclaims with an air of annoyance .
va	3	Fighting the suction with every step , he simply reacted too late , the vacuum finally pulling him off balance and into the monster 's mouth .
va	1	A simple , black belt secures the cloth about his waist , the shirt dangling just above his knees over his baggy , black pants .
va	1	Scouring his mind for the answer , a grin steals over his face as he leaps back a step and squints through his transparent palm .
va	1	The entire horizon collapses downward , spilling into the approaching lake of molten liquid while sporadic plumes of lava throw islands of earth into the ceiling aggressively .
va	0	Briefly landing upon a smaller group , Mai immediately leaps away once again , causing the boy to rush his terrible footing into a clumsy jump .
va	0	Soaring back into the air Rift lands upon a particularly long colony of bats , feverishly flying against him as he runs atop the bulk of them .
va	0	The reverse tidal wave of earth falling into the churning ocean of lava has nearly reached him as Mai appears , grabbing hold of his hand .
va	3	Swinging him toward the door alters his momentum enough to prevent a harsh landing , and without looking back , the boy sprints through the portal .
va	0	Back inside Death Mountain , Rift promptly slows to a stop and collapses from exhaustion , heaving heavily as he strains to catch his breath .
va	1	Appearing beside him , Mai rolls him over and lifts his head into her lap , softly stroking his hair until his breathing returns to normal .
va	0	" I wish I could tell you , " she sighs , shaking her head as she continues to run her fingers through his dirty hair .
va	0	" Son of a torch slug , " he exclaims , hooking an arm around the boy 's neck and leading him back into his chambers .
va	3	With only the faint breeze and drumming of water upon treetops to guide him , the warlock continues forward , taking paths essentially at random .
va	4	His shabby , thatched clothing appears to have been handmade , but before the king of thieves can get a good look , he vanishes .
va	2	Donning a green hood in an effort to simulate Rift 's signature look , she scowls through the downpour of water to offer a warning .
va	0	Blindly lifting an idle hand to his right , Ganondorf charges a small orb of dark energy and fires the projectile at a nearby house .
va	3	Connecting with the tree directly behind his target , Link zips the remaining distance , scooping Ganondorf off the ground with a punch to the stomach .
va	4	The hammer and anvil continue to meet between the foes , the force of each impact causing spheres of water to expand through the torrential rain .
va	1	He is within Din 's reach , her arms extending around him , but still she waits , wanting for him to embrace her himself .
va	1	He is now within the orb , and staring into his Goddess ' gorgeous yellow eyes as her pouty lips drift closer and closer to his .
va	2	Lifting a boot to crush the look from her face , a pain like no other bolts into the king of thieves ' body like lightning .
va	0	A primal roar of fear and pain echoes through the forest as Link removes the sharp shard of steel , preparing to stab him again .
va	4	A pair of eyes track his every move from the thick canopy overhead , waiting until he is out of earshot to make a move .
va	0	Only the warlock 's cape lies upon the ferns , rocks , and flowers , taking a humanoid shape at the right angle and distance .
va	4	I 'll meet up with the rest of you soon , " Zelda announces , ushering the rest of the group out of the area .
va	3	" I am sworn to an oath of respect as well as protection , " he points out , standing up strait and relaxing a little .
va	0	The damage done to his soul is too traumatic to be felt right away , like a boulder falling upon him and smashing a limb .
va	2	I know you 're confused about what 's been happening , " she sighs , obviously not looking forward to what she is about to say .
va	1	Sensing his trepidation , the Goddess summons another rush of wind and light , transforming back into the fairy companion Link has grown accustomed to .
va	3	With that she drops through the dimensional window , leaving the hero with his hand outstretched , and failing to voice his protest in time .
va	4	" We 'd like to purchase a mask , " she half mumbles , suddenly very interested in the mask salesman , circling him several times .
va	3	" Just , you stay there , and I 'll stand here , " he instructs , clearly very nervous about the surging population within the clock .
va	3	Immediately dashing across the room , the kid snatches the mask from the man 's grasp , retreating to a shadowy corner to try it on .
va	0	Landing safely upon a small platform of earth , he waits for his eyes to adjust , but all he finds is an endless black .
va	4	A chillingly cold wind pushes through the area , the cavern obviously very large , though he has no way of perceiving the specific scale .
va	0	Each of the many rooms floats in the air upon a hovering slab of earth , arrayed in the distance like a dark , cloud kingdom .
va	3	Saturated with blood , the wire drips the dark red liquid consistently , a steady stream tracing its way down the line from unknown sources .
va	3	The husks of muscle take notice of the visitor , attempting to converge on one side of the room , but ultimately moving very little .
va	0	With an agitated sigh , the boy makes his way across the weaving and dipping path , finally reaching an ideal spot to line up a shot .
va	3	Clearing his throat , Rift is the one to finally break away , motioning toward the door in an effort to point out the task at hand .
va	4	Leading the boy back through the horrible room , Mai keeps a firm grip of his hand as the screams consistently cause his muscles to seize up .
va	3	The thick , stone floor they are standing upon is obliterated causing Rift to fall with the debris down onto a hidden floor of the structure .
va	2	The occasional twitch or muscle spasm makes Rift 's skin crawl , the bony apparitions of flesh and bone turning their wooden heads toward the boy .
va	1	The trip through the room of barbed wire and blood is difficult , Rift 's limbs consistently freezing as Mai struggles to pull him forward .
va	4	The more of me you have , the less you can see , " he proclaims , closing his eyes and returning to his meditative state .
va	2	Should you fail to best it , you will join the others below , " he concludes , hovering off the ground slowly as he fades away .
va	1	Sick and tired of this terrible place , Rift pounces upon his fallen foe , straddling its heaving chest and pummeling its head with vicious right hands .
va	1	Mai screams , but to no avail as the grounded ghoul whips its sword across its chest , throwing Rift across the battleground like a ragdoll .
va	3	The entire platform gives way , the wires suspending it finally succumbing to the structural damage inflicted upon them as it swings downward like a trap door .
va	1	Tumbling down toward certain death , Rift is kicked over into a preferable trajectory by Mai , narrowly missing a particularly nasty series of bloody wires .
va	1	Fingernails scraping across chalkboards , screaming children , and satanic bellows seem to rise up into the room as the pit below is slowly consumed by shadow .
va	1	Standing proudly with her arms crossed , the woman 's most striking feature is her massive ponytail of white hair waving lazily in the faint breeze .
va	3	Taking his time , he waits for his breathing to return to normal before he starts for the dim moonlight shining in from the outside .
va	4	Turning back to face the dark room , the boy feels certain he just saw a shadow move out of the corner of his eye .
va	4	Resting on a knee , she makes no attempt to speak out of turn , simply hoping he is not too preoccupied to acknowledge her .
va	4	Her emotionless visage would seem as though the words failed to affect her , but a single tear rolls down her cheek despite the fact .
va	4	Using far more power than necessary , the wood is annihilated by the punch , the splintered pieces spearing into the renovated buildings near the entrance .
va	4	Resuming his march toward the altar , Ganondorf stares into the priest 's soul with primal eyes , yet to decide precisely how he will kill him .
va	4	" I 'll not stand idly by while someone conspires against the well-being of the realm , " she starts , beginning to grow defensive .
va	1	With an effortless grace , she whips the spike in his direction , aiming for his back in a simple attempt to get his attention .
va	1	Though his sudden bursts of speed are formidable , the strikes that follow always arrive too late to inflict any damage upon the skilled assassin .
va	1	" I am sorry for my ignorance , but now I understand , " she continues , slowly stepping forward with no intention to attack .
va	4	Stumbling back a step , she finds what she had expected , Mai 's translucent form recoiling her fist as she glares with intense anger .
va	1	" Finally , I 'm strong enough to help you fight , " Mai smirks , turning to her companion and giving him an assuring nod .
va	3	Without an instant to breath between the seamless attacks , Mai appears once again , mimicking Rift 's style , but with her own girlish flair .
va	4	Before she is even able to properly gain her bearings , a heavy knee lands on her lower back just to the right of her spine .
va	1	There is a place for you in this world , " she points out , her eye twitching irritably when Mai assimilates next to him .
va	4	Releasing her deep breath , the ninja smiles as escape from the holy projectile is no longer an option for the pale lady of the void .
va	1	The unimaginable knowledge of a thousand millennia flows in through all of her senses simultaneously , Sheik 's convulsing body acting as a lightning rod of divinity .
va	3	The setting is eerily quiet , the vast majority of the inhabitants having moved into the castle until the slow moving repairs show some progress .
va	1	The scraping of shifting stone sounds in short durations from all directions , as if Death Mountain itself is toying with the idea of collapse .
va	1	Rushing to her side , he quickly lifts her into his lap , brushing the hair out of her face and praying she is still alive .
va	4	The massive wall protecting the town now suffers a gaping weakness , the centuries-old erection blasted away as if it were hit by an enormous wrecking ball .
va	4	Before the sentries can scramble to respond , the hero has already reached the stairs , dismounting and gingerly pulling the queen down into his arms .
va	4	The years of danger and battle have numbed the hero 's skills of diplomacy , and he plays the battle out in his subconscious mind .
va	1	Heading her words first , Link lowers the blade to his side slowly , rising from his battle stance as he realizes she is right .
va	1	Eager to counter , the captain is thrown off balance as Navi aggressively darts into his face , eluding his flailing swipes while Link consoles his companion .
va	1	Charging against the steady wind , he scoops the shield off his back , twirling it in his hand before twisting his arm through the grip .
va	0	Rising to his feet , Link is able to draw , aim , and fire just as rapidly as his foe , shooting down attack after attack .
va	4	Launching himself downward with twice the momentum , the king of thieves flips into a downward stomp , the likes of which there is no defense against .
va	2	His rage having left him for the moment , Ganondorf considers his options as the boy in the hood slowly climbs back to his feet .
va	2	Zelda 's words breathe down upon the horizons of his mind , but even so Link must wonder what good could possibly come of sparing him .
va	4	Mai must know by now he is awake , but even so he remains where he lies , too ashamed to arise and realize his defeat .
va	1	Mai lying beside him , smiling a sad smile of obligatory encouragement while she waits for some kind of sign he is prepared to continue .
va	1	" Maybe not , but that won 't stop me , " he shrugs , spinning into a defensive position when a scratching sound emanates from behind .
va	2	These things will probably find it soon , " he points out , squatting down near the edge of the lofty balcony overlooking the area .
va	1	You 're jealous , " he accuses with a smile , stealthily moving past chasms of sand , spiraling down into pits of certain death .
va	1	The intense pressure builds in his airtight space until it suddenly relents , gravity grabbing hold of his gut as he is sucked down into open air .
va	1	The gravitational force of an entire temple turning upside down is absurdly powerful , throwing Rift flat on his face within arm 's reach of his goal .
va	3	Falling almost all the way back to the bottom , he cannot help but question whether the portal he left behind is in the right place .
va	3	" It must be back in the first room , " he admits , not looking forward to taking the plunge through the narrow again .
va	4	It is becoming obvious this temple requires many passes through the middle section in order to explore the buried and unearthed depths at the optimal times .
va	1	The dim glow of the purple sand has all but diminished causing the setting to be significantly darker until the hourglass can right itself once again .
va	1	Tightly grabbing hold of her wrist , Rift swings through the faded grains of pink sand , now creating a waterfall from the central room .
va	0	Raising his right hand back to his eye , the boy spots the final lever room standing slightly higher than the sand has managed to reach .
va	3	Struggling to retain his balance , Rift continues to eye the spot on the ceiling he found earlier , watching and waiting for the optimal moment .
va	3	Several places within the room stand out in the darkness , and without a second thought , the boy places a portal on a distant wall .
va	3	Just past the main foyer and up the mighty staircase , Ganondorf rests comfortably upon the throne , sampling the castles best wine while he waits .
va	4	The three before him stare , all of them equally shocked by the dark blood staining his clothing and dripping down the face of his shield .
va	1	In a devastating instant , he grabs the sword hand of the light warrior , jerking her forward before releasing his grip and striking her ribcage .
va	1	Doubling over with pain , she is unable to stop her shield from being stripped away , and thrown across the room by Link 's intensifying rage .
va	1	His blade skipping off the uneven ground with a clang , the hero begins to pick his opponent apart , carefully analyzing his reactions and timing .
va	0	Beginning to descend back to the ground , one of Ganondorf 's orbs suddenly rockets back at him , batted back at the warlock like a fastball .
va	1	Back on the ground , he steadies his upturned palm by tightly gripping his wrist , the growing , pulsating orb quickly becoming a dangerous weapon .
va	2	Remaining out of the hero 's reach , Ganondorf leaps from one conjured platform to the next , finally throwing the deadly ball downward with a grunt .
va	4	Not expecting the cunning tactic , the hero fails to react in time as the orb hits the ground before he can close the distance .
va	3	Finally lifting a single hand , the monster begins to laugh in its gravelly , distorted tone as Link prepares to block the coming attack .
va	1	With a furious swing , he intends to obliterate the woman , but it stops short as Zelda invokes a much more potent shield than Link possesses .
va	1	Staring up at him curiously , the boy doesn 't move a muscle as the beast lifts his sword overhead and stabs down at the foolish child .
va	4	A wave of silence spills over the room , and though no one present respected the man , they all realize the importance of his death .
va	1	Realizing the trap being lain far too late to voice a warning , Link 's eyes double in size as the brilliant ruse comes to fruition .
va	3	The moment the attacks touch the boy , he gradually turns transparent , waiting within the safety of the void until Mai returns him to his dimension .
va	1	Nearly losing consciousness from the assault , Rift regains his senses in time to see the massive chunk of stone the hero has just launched at him .
va	3	A steady rain of stone blocks , and metallic supports seems as though it will never end , the blast throwing debris to untold heights .
va	1	Staring daggers at the dark creature standing before her , Mai has no intention of losing now , slowly circling her opponent and ready for anything .
va	4	Her beloved chosen was only intended to be a shell through which she could enact her own solution to the perpetual cycle of her sister 's creation .
va	1	He endured the worst kind of pain , fighting for his life throughout his travels , but found the highest state of accomplishment upon achieving his aspirations .
va	3	The purest of heart , and never faltering in his moral obligations , his mettle was tested beyond that which any mortal being should be put through .
va	0	It had broken his heart to shove his fingers , held rigid like a spear , into the hollow of Billy 's throat that Christmas Eve .
va	3	Most importantly , however , the gun is designed to work only intermittently , giving you ample opportunity to holster it and use your fists . "
va	1	" So you want me to sign something for the Cramps that says I can deliver this year 's Christmas presents , " said Duke .
va	2	" Uh , sir , if you could just , you know ... " " No , I don 't know , " said Terwilliger .
va	3	" What is thy bidding , my mas -- " " I told you to knock that crap off , " said the Shadow President .
va	0	The smell of frying meat hung in the air like a bulimic hobo wrapped in a tablecloth made of bacon and soaked in maple syrup .
va	0	An unassuming man with a mustache , wearing a photographer 's vest and a baseball cap , was standing at the counter of the Gordo 's .
va	4	He carried a microphone in one hand , the wire from which had been cut and simply swung freely from the end of the mike .
va	4	" Yeah , and it just happens to fall on the calendar after the Christmas stuff is over and before the New Year 's stuff commences .
va	2	Even Ken Goodspeed managed to get off a few rounds from his pistol , although he was obviously trying very hard not to upset anyone .
va	4	Tying off the belt from his bathrobe on one of the exposed pipes overhead , Chip reflected that Christmas morning was something he could not face .
va	0	It said that Bryce Grain had used his own name and personal information to sign up for a Laotian Sex Slave dating service through the Internet .
va	4	A captive audience to whatever loved ones ' medical emergencies had brought them here , they stared back at the wall-mounted television with something like resignation .
va	1	I liked working with kittens and puppies , and I miss my family , but I have to admit it feels good to be saving Christmas .
va	0	A tiny , green , scaly hand balled into a tiny , green , scaly fist was attached to a tiny , green , stunted arm .
va	1	He climbed down from the monster 's back and made waving gestures at the flaming ninja , who was now running through the neighbor 's yard .
va	4	Enraged , Cain slew Abel with his fists , a feat in which he was only slightly hindered by the impressively enormous size of his posterior .
va	2	Do you know , Gary , that I had to lay off an entire troop of my elves during the Christmas Season of 1981 ? "
va	4	" Gary , when Mrs. Claus had her first stroke , thanks to the stress of your legal war against me , I eventually made the adjustment .
va	4	Dressed in dark blue military cadet uniforms , the three friends joked as they walked across the grass between the metallic , modern academy buildings .
va	1	" I 'm not saying , " Link frowned , causing his thick black eyebrows to touch in the middle , giving him a unibrow .
va	4	By the age of thirteen , he had obtained his third black belt in multiple martial art forms in which his father kept him enrolled .
va	1	His pulse throbbed in his temples at having to sit on the sidelines and watch , when he could have participated in his first bust .
va	3	The man continued to scream out the woman 's name until a sharp jab to his temple with the end of a club knocked him out cold .
va	3	Although only riding in the attack vehicles and watching through the windows wasn 't that exciting , it beat the heck out of smelling like garbage .
va	3	When his focus jumped to the letter , it snapped his attention away from the throbbing in his temples and to the area around him .
va	3	It kept replaying all the events surrounding the letter ; the termination at the teleport , the break in , and the conversation with the girl .
va	4	The second they came to a stop , the soldiers filed out in an orderly fashion and assumed defensive positions around a large dilapidated warehouse .
va	2	" We will only have time for one per session , so I 'll let you chose which one you want to start with . "
va	4	As he used a piece of scratch paper to work on his calculus homework like he always did , he wrote a few words between the equations .
va	2	Even though it was for show , the urge to go to the restroom was real ; he had just consumed thirty-four ounces of soda .
va	1	" Did you think I wouldn 't notice her digging through a trashcan and then carrying out the cup my son had brought in ? "
va	4	" Power to the building will be cut in ten , nine , eight ... " At " zero " , the building went completely dark .
va	3	One could enter a public space without a card but it would draw immediate attention and result in a fine or imprisonment for being without it .
va	3	The rest of the troops tore into the lab , snatching up documents , equipment , and meds and piled the stuff on the floor .
va	3	" They were making meds , sir , " a Sergeant Major stated handing a computer pad to the captain with documentation of the confiscated items .
va	3	It was only a short time later that he stood on the platform with the same female voice counting down the seconds until their departure .
va	4	A bright bulb like a street lamp hung from the center of the roof over the tracks , providing the area its main source of light .
va	1	He swung the butt of the gun down on the back of the woman 's skull knocking her unconscious and sending her sliding across the floor .
va	2	A loud clunk , followed by a strange whooshing sound , and the lights began to power back up , flooding the land with their dazzling rays .
va	1	His clothes were shabby , his long hair was unkempt , and dark rings circled his eyes , symptomatic of a restless night 's sleep .
va	3	It also gave birth to a group that met in the cover of night , and hid in the shadows of society , the Veils .
va	3	I 'd always tried to live by this philosophy , but if I were to listen to Benton then that way of life was unattainable .
va	0	Layers of triangular jagged metal overlapped to create a terrifying , spiky cocoon shape that all amassed to a sharp single point at its top .
va	4	I 'd heard the sound thousands of times before , but I was already tense in present company ; I almost jumped out of my skin .
va	0	Fine , " I babbled , not wanting to appear childish ; after all , I was practically entering adulthood at almost two cycles old .
va	4	Firstly , all couples must be born within the same forty-eight hour time period , and come from the same or any neighbouring village within two miles .
va	4	Zeal was not my idea of the perfect life partner , but she did save me from a life of servitude under a military regime .
va	4	Standing in the darkness , I was reminded of stories I 'd heard as a boy , tales of life before ' The Change ' .
va	4	We stopped walking and remained still , unsure if we should continue , when a new sound began to replace the din of distress from the village .
va	4	A large , heavy set soldier ; at least one point six metres tall and probably the same in width , stepped out of the vehicle .
va	4	Following a meagre breakfast , that I prepared myself from the remaining food Zeal hadn 't eaten the night before , I left for work .
va	4	Chapter Eight ' Detained ' The doors glided open effortlessly , unlike the frightened passengers who surged from the carriage desperate to abandon the ill-fated tram .
va	3	The only method of transport in and out of Trans Central was the tram network , without it , I had no way of entering the capital .
va	2	I passed Kron who looked on , not with an expression of suspicion , but more of apprehension ; I doubted his anxiety was for my well-being .
va	1	If I tried , I 'd more than likely have a Jolt plunged into my back and my unconscious body would be carried into the military vehicle .
va	4	A small screen in the centre of the dashboard showed an image that must have been transmitted from a camera at the back of the vehicle .
va	1	" I know the outer communities don 't have back-up power systems , but Trans Central surely has back-ups , for back-ups , for back-ups . "
va	4	That pesky fear was again taking over , and I was relieved when we arrived at a copious open plot of land beyond the devices .
va	3	I leaned against the wall in an attempt to keep my balance , but found it difficult to get a grip on its silky surface .
va	0	" It 's an absolute pleasure , " said the doctor grabbing my hand and shaking it with more heartiness than he did Minister Drake 's .
va	4	" What 's really weird is they said there was no record of our bonding ... " " Because we haven 't been bonded ! "
va	4	Zeal was a skilled hunter and a reasonable fighter , but even she couldn 't take on two highly trained members of the armed forces .
va	4	As the door began to swing shut , unknown to me at the time , Zeal leaped from the bed and prevented the latch from catching .
va	0	An old , well used sofa , a wooden desk that was chipped and scratched , and several bookshelves that were ready to fall apart .
va	4	He had a head full of thin , grey hair , deep set wrinkles over his face , and thin tight lips that appeared dried and cracked .
va	3	I wanted to know the truth , but I was wary of what that truth would mean ; of how much would it change my life .
va	4	A few minutes earlier the doctor had been skipping around the room with a cheery disposition ; I now found that memory hard to recall .
va	3	I wanted to sound firm and assertive ; I wanted to do justice to my Grandfather 's memory , but my voice betrayed my intentions .
va	4	I began poisoning him from then onwards ; a little bit here , a little bit there , but the resilient old fool simply refused to die .
va	0	" Within minutes the Trojans will reach full power ; they will launch an attack on Earth , and we will live in the darkness again .
va	3	I took a deep breath and then , screaming at the top of my lungs , I let out a shriek that sliced through the air .
va	3	If you open it up you can punch in the code manually ; the deactivation order should be instantly transmitted to the entire network . "
va	4	The longer I waited , the more apprehensive I became , the more sweat my body produced , and the more it caused my burns to sting .
va	0	As usual , I 'd arrived early , so a kind lady had provided me with a glass of water and told me where to sit .
va	2	Most would believe these stories , but I was certain it would also add to the conspiracy theories ; a conspiracy I was now a part of .

va	3	I close my eyes as I , yet again , cut through another cloud -- nothing better than cold damp clothes sticking to your body .
va	4	Before he was even done with his sentence I had already opened the drawer and was stunned to see it overfilled with tear gas cans .
va	3	With his sad , mopey look down at me he said , " Can 't you at least TRY to be a little more discreet ?
va	3	I could feel my hands tighten into fists as my eye twitched uncontrollably -- - I was unaware this guy had some sort of death wish .
va	4	We entered the swanky place that was so clean it made you want to break something just so the employee 's would have some work to do .
va	2	One more time is all I hoped for so I 'd have a reason to jump over the counter and staple his crotch to his thigh .
va	3	To top it off , the mask didn 't vent very well and it was uncomfortable to feel my own breath roll down my neck .
va	3	This caused the eyes to fog up quickly and made it hard to see -- I hated that Atticus was partially right -- this time .
va	4	Since he was a peon he was left outside to guard the door while the rest of the men fucked around inside probably drinking and talking shit .
va	2	I stood up and was about to make my way out into the hall when , without warning , two grenades bounced into the doorway from Macro .
va	4	Stuck in the corner with no way out , Atticus gripped his gun tighter and turned his head to see a fire extinguisher enclosed in glass .
va	1	The ironic thing was I didn 't just like my new life I loved it , I just didn 't know what to do with it .
va	0	Not only did he hate the sand , that was now riding up his shorts , he was also deathly afraid of what lurked in ocean water .
va	0	Ezra didn 't talk to me the rest of the day -- victory , like always , was mine -- and that was only Saturday .
va	3	I had set up five ' X 's ' around town on the ground with white chalk to help make the targets stand out more .
va	4	Once the girls found the ' X ' on the ground , they had to find the oranges with a black ' X ' marked on them .
va	4	With her free hand she reached for the orange trying her hardest to loosen the orange from the dogs ' mouth and pry it out .
va	2	Even with both hands she couldn 't pry it out of the dogs ' mouth as orange juice fused with slobber oozed down her arm .
va	0	In her back pocket was a sharpie marker she had used to draw an ' X ' on an orange she found at a fruit stand .
va	4	I could smell the fresh sharpie when she handed me the orange but to be fair I never told the girls that they couldn 't cheat .
va	0	Because it was night I grabbed two of my new canisters ; one had a picture of a sun with a happy face I called Second Sun .
va	4	In front of me was none other than the biggest pile of ' gold ' I 'd ever seen -- loot from the cargo ships .
va	2	The only problem was that Captain Osiris was not an easy sleeper and it took three hours before Atticus could hear a snore out of his mouth .
va	4	Chapter Eight : Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang When we got back from the tanker job the only thing I wanted to do was sleep .
va	4	She knew when a guy was interested the way he was and she 'd be lying if she said she didn 't feel the same .
va	0	I was fully loaded with my gas mask and canisters totally owning the guys in what felt like a game of hide and go fuck yourself .
va	4	Turned out it was just a bad side effect of sleeping for more than twelve hours because when I woke up I had missed half the day .
va	0	I checked the calendar I kept in my room and saw that the music festival in Aurora , a city near Lumina , was tonight -- perfect .
va	3	I attached a few canisters around my garter belt just incase the shit hit the fan and I needed to switch to contract killer mode .
va	4	When she smiled , she had those eyes that make it so that you couldn 't help but smile back -- - I kept my guard up .
va	1	" Well , I can see who wears the pants in this relationship and I 'm so glad Atticus filled you in on our little operation .
va	2	" I will not stand here and listen to how our prize money gets sworn in as a member to the honorary club of brain damaged boys .
va	3	" First off , " I said with a mouth full of cookies , " there 's about five things wrong with that sentence . "
va	4	While I stalled with a little small talk , I gave the room a once over and eyed his safe -- - his unlocked and open safe .
va	0	Once he had walked to the next car , I closed the door and made my way down the hall -- gas mask dangling around my neck .
va	2	I glanced down as the warm blood dripped down my arm and flew off the side of the train -- - that was going to cost him .
va	1	After insisting I could walk myself , he carried my struggling body back to the train while I filled him in on how the event went down .
va	0	That , apparently , was the magical cue for his angry group of mining friends to walk out of the train , all carrying weapons .
va	2	Long story short , Alita had spent some of our ransom money on a fancy hotel room while she gambled the rest away in the hotels casino .
va	2	I began to wonder if I kept it up , if Alita 's head would pop off her shoulders like a cork out of a Champaign bottle .
va	0	The stench of stale air mingled with garbage -- I would 've gave anything to trade my gas mask in for an oxygen mask right about now .
va	1	I 'd go as far as saying he 'd make Hitler look like the Pope if it wasn 't for his slight , minuscule lisp .
va	4	While under that bathtub , buried alive for two days , something in Eden changed for the worse -- - as if that was possible .
va	3	I knew he was setting me up for something I just didn 't know what exactly that was yet so I played his little game .
va	0	With my comrades out of my way , I was free to jump around the ship like an acrobat , spinning and twirling my blade .
va	0	I slowly put on my battle gear and wrapped a scarf around my face -- I didn 't want another face full of chewing tobacco .
va	2	By the time I was done worrying about that one , two more bullets were on their way -- glad to know Pops wasn 't holding back .
va	3	He stretched and took a few steps towards the kitchen then abruptly stopped when the chain I had tied around his ankle caught tight against the bed .
va	3	He then used his limited strength to lift the bottom of the bed off the ground and slide out the chain -- victory was his .
va	0	A dust cloud as high as a skyscraper kicked up into the air behind them as they raced their metal cans down towards the town .
va	4	These bad boys were sporting all black and looked like they were part of some sort of special ops team -- boy were they special all right .
va	4	We needed to get moving and cover some extra ground so I peeked down the hall and saw four more patrolling guards along with security cameras .
va	0	Alita flipped over a writing desk , spilling ink and paper onto a five hundred year old rug as Atticus combed around for an alternate escape route .
va	1	The next night I hadn 't caught anything for dinner , so I dug into the bread and one of the few apples left in my knapsack .
va	3	Then , he patiently waited until NASA 's shuttle program came to a sad end and contracted the best minds in the U.S. Space program .
va	1	As I step onto the moon I think in my mind , that this is one step for man and one giant leap for mankind .
va	1	The two men nodded , one lifting the unconscious man up over his shoulder in a fireman 's lift , and they silently padded out of town .
va	4	He was in the middle , taller than the rest , and was showing one of the locals how to put together a suicide vest .
va	1	It was quite a shock when Ryan asked his father for a loan for his first business venture , sexy ladies ' underwear of all things .
va	4	A year after he and his company developed into a profitable venture , they were beginning to control a large share of the personal computer market .
va	0	Ryan and his team had studied all the possibilities of reaching space , and how other companies were attempting what he was about to do .
va	1	Ryan 's design to use ion thruster space propulsion systems was created by Boris and the Russian scientists he had employed right at the beginning .
va	0	Our company will make money bringing back valuable ores , minerals , and gas from space , a far more lucrative venture than the first two ideas .
va	3	With his new legs fitted onto his stumps , the therapy crew got him walking again , but it took a couple of months longer than expected .
va	4	He also received his discharge papers and was informed of what was due to him for eleven years of service and his two lost legs .
va	3	The officer allowed him to take in the news , sitting next to her in the patrol car , and waited for the usual reactions .
va	0	He was a little embarrassed for crying as she was quite good looking , and not more than half a dozen years older than he was .
va	3	He didn 't attend school the next day , but sat in his mother 's favorite rocking chair on the front porch and waited for company .
va	3	Upon asking if VIN had eaten anything that day , the policeman left and returned with a fresh pizza , telling VIN that he had better eat .
va	4	The bank was the same one the retired doctor used and he asked for a few minutes while he went in and checked with his branch .
va	4	Sure , he had had lots of short relationships , but for some reason , explicitly noted by VIN , the girls always seemed to disappear .
va	4	And , so far , in between hangovers -- and I have never drunk so much in my life -- we seem to get along . "
va	4	I trimmed her out for landing , told everybody to buckle up , and went in for a perfect landing with the one engine on full thrust .
va	4	After about five minutes , VIN realized that it had been four hours since breakfast at Idaho Springs , and his stomach needed some sustenance .
va	1	Instead , he picked up nine cases of British pounds sterling from his bank in Switzerland , so as not to break so many U.S. laws .
va	4	One he met and bedded on the fifth day was striking , until in the morning she asked for her nightly rate of $ 250 .
va	1	It finally happened ; on the seventh day VIN 's total stash of winnings was reduced to a measly hundred bucks by Jonesy 's spending .
va	4	Jonesy seemed back into the adventure , especially after asking his first question as VIN headed out of Las Vegas on I-95 toward Tonopah , Nevada .
va	4	" Why don 't you call up the boss and say that his replacement silver bullet is here , and we are thirsty , " Jonesy replied .
va	1	Nothing happened for nearly thirty minutes ; the guard didn 't return , and the truck behind them , its engine running , just waited .
va	4	The gate opened , VIN started the engine , and they drove in and were directed behind the guardhouse and next to the other Audi .
va	4	" No , a tough Marine , Mr. Richmond ; just slow due to crappy off-the-shelf military leg prosthetics , " replied Jonesy protecting his friend .
va	1	" Sorry , I didn 't mean to insult you , young man , " replied the owner and carried on to the top of the incline .
va	0	" We are only taking up a second stage shuttle , and inside the shuttle a spacecraft , as high as the aircraft can fly .
va	4	" The last covering , like the soft inside wall of a commercial airliner , will be sealed onto the inner wall of each panel .
va	3	These suits , VIN , will be the suits that you and I will wear to go out of the spacecraft and do spacewalks . "
va	4	It wasn 't that heavy , but this piece of cake made it feel like it had added a hundred pounds or more to his body weight .
va	4	Her parents -- her mother a computer analyst and her father a software engineer -- worked at one of the new and fast-growing companies in the area .
va	4	At sixteen , Maggie finally had enough of the endless mowing , weeding , and pruning and asked her father to take her to the airfield .
va	4	asked Maggie , and the young man , maybe ten years older than she , sat down and gave her a ten-minute lesson on flight .
va	3	That sounded like a lot of money to Maggie , so she shyly said that she would think about it , and would ask her father .
va	3	I had to go up to Seattle for that conference last year and hated the idea of sitting in a small place without fresh air . "
va	3	As they walked in their eyes grew accustomed to interior lighting for the sixth time , and the first of two shapes glinted back at them .
va	4	On each side of the higher , third motor they saw a much smaller and different rocket exhaust , one-tenth the size of the big three .
va	3	" Once she ejects out of the C-5 at 400 knots or faster , her wings and tail extend out to maximum within four seconds .
va	2	I will not sign those documents for you to waste your life , and our savings , and go and fly a stupid airplane ! "
va	0	Most guys who come in and drink at exactly four Saturday afternoon have been waiting outside for an hour , and are totally drunk by six .
va	4	The run would cover about 10,000 feet , about two miles , since the apron was in the middle of the length of the long runway .
va	0	The two ladies smiled at him , and Suzi watched from her wheelchair as Tatyana continued , like a tailor measuring him for a suit .
va	4	In other words , you will have mechanical legs for everyday use , and a second exoskeleton set can be added to your body for space training .
va	1	It took VIN a few seconds to understand what Suzi meant , and once it hit him , their giggling made him turn red again .
va	0	" I don 't mind a few drinks now and again , " said Ryan as he watched VIN pour a decent amount into a glass .
va	3	He thanked the men for the drink , told him that they had twenty-four hours to work on the colonel , and left the room .
va	3	She certainly wasn 't going to take any crap from this test pilot , and for once , maybe Jonesy 's mouth had met its match .
va	0	Maybe this technology is new to you , but it is far more modern and safer than what has previously been used in any national space programs .
va	1	On the runs VIN was at the back as usual , and noticed his partner just behind the three girls , only a hundred yards behind Ryan .
va	1	Work will commence on our fuel tanks and on new lines to the outer fuel transfer connection units on the outer walls of the hangars .
va	4	If they find out what we are doing , it is likely they will want to intervene and assume some governmental control for political or financial reasons .
va	4	That morning during the run , and for the first time since he had been at the airfield , he felt so useless without his legs .
va	4	Under the T-shirts , oversized jogging trousers were worn to hide the leg metal , and then VIN placed new track shoes over his new metal feet .
va	2	Not believing what they saw , both looked forward to put on speed to catch Ryan only a hundred feet or so ahead of them .
va	1	Jonesy , who had just barely outrun Maggie and Penny , stayed away from VIN , not knowing how to handle this new man ... or robot ?
va	3	The shuttle 's first flight will be to fly up to another space station already in space , a dormant Russian satellite in a much lower orbit .
va	0	Two are sleep units , then a command module , and the forth a larger communal relaxation and work module which can separated if necessary .
va	0	It was one of the first space stations programs ; the space station is large , and on reentry , it could cause much damage .
va	3	First , we take up some supplies and connect our shuttle with its extending docking port to one of the space station 's docking ports .
va	4	Once we are at maximum , we will achieve one mission every ten days , the quickest we expect to turn around a shuttle flight .
va	4	The next four flights after the water will transport 16.4 tons of soil , seeds , and animal stocks ; everything needed to sustain life up there .
va	2	" Down to 420 knots ... ... ... ... 410 ... ... ... 400 ... ... ... 395 ... ... 390 ... ... 385 ... ... 380 .
va	1	Ms. Sinclair and Ms. Sullivan will pilot Mission Two to the Russian Satellite with the special cargo , plus supplies to be stored in the satellite .
va	1	Every aircraft had crosswind tables to help the pilot understand at what speed the crosswinds were safe for an aircraft , and its maximum crosswind thresholds .
va	3	After eight test flights , both pilots had the final four minutes of flight , as well as the landing of the shuttles , figured out .
va	1	Again , on approach , the shuttle returned to 50,000 feet inside the airfield 's 20-mile border , not causing any danger to high-flying civilian aircraft .
va	3	I 've turned flight controls over to autopilot , computer reducing power to one half , speed Mach 19 , using thrusters to turn us upright .
va	4	I see the Middle East coming up , and I 'm sure we saw the silver glinting space station head over us from left to right . "
va	2	Maggie closed the outside doors and from then on , for 150 seconds , all Jonesy could do was monitor the computerized flight on instruments .
va	3	His mother , a married student , had to leave her studies and start work to support the family as his father passed from job to job .
va	3	Debt collectors often came calling , and Michael was told what to say to them , while his parents hid and left him to answer the door .
va	4	Here , instead of flying craft , were hundreds of what looked like rabbits in the first separated section and chickens in the second and third sections .
va	3	Unfortunately , it took humans thousands of years to form our current eating habits , and we just can 't change them in a decade or so .
va	4	There were also plastic shelves full of equipment , like watering systems , hoses , and anything that could be found in the gardening section .
va	0	" On the floor we have a small area of wheat , sorghum , pepper plants with several varieties of peppers , and an area of asparagus .
va	4	" The ' gravity ' will be produced by a magnetic field of rare-earth metals passing through the middle of the room up there . "
va	1	All plant growth needs only minimum gravity and doesn 't lose nearly as much nutrition or strength in lower gravity situations , as does animal life . "
va	3	It is going to take you this time to change , shower , and make sure you don 't take anything out of here with you . "
va	1	Also we will be taking added items like salt up with us until we find an asteroid or planet that has sodium chloride on it .
va	2	" The first two sections , " Ryan told them " is for the production of xenon gas , the propulsion fuel for deep space flight .
va	2	" Helium will be important in the cooling of our arc welding by our robotic spiders in space and for some of our mining tools .
va	3	Tomorrow , I begin to fulfill my dream that started when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon , actually eight years after he did so .
va	2	" Congratulations Mr. Jones , you are now 60 miles , 100 kilometers above Earth and in an official Lower Space Orbit , or LSO .
va	2	Once on board the station used an old , different sort of scrambled radio , which only the Russians working with Ryan could remember how to use .
va	2	Inside the command module he now had four dull red lights glowing on the flight console and two the two small computer screens showed nothing .
va	3	He explained to Jonesy that the first red light was the fifth gauge from the left and Jonesy told him that it was the temperature light .
va	3	Jonesy told him that he thought it all right for him to turn on the nuclear battery in its position underneath the module 's main control panel .
va	2	The ship was tiny compared to normal ground accommodations , but up in space it was roomy enough for six people to live and work .
va	3	By this time he was on the other side of the country , but often thought about driving back to see if she would marry him .
va	3	Maybe the cosmonauts had left the stuff in this unit knowing that it would be the best place for the liquid and bottle to survive .
va	4	The next morning , refreshed after his eight-hour drive the day before and his usual early morning run , Ryan went into to Hangar Seven .
va	3	" Just under fifty percent the size of our old NASA shuttles you say , and with fully retractable wings and tail , and five motors .
va	4	They cannot enter their working areas until they have gone through a shower and dust collector system , the same used in the European Space program .
va	3	They want to see the actual aircraft that is propelling our shuttles into space and how we can achieve space at only twenty million dollars per flight .
va	3	If he ever had to testify in court , he could honestly state that the purchase was not landed on U.S. soil , only at his airfield .
va	0	As Ryan had said to him , this was his training for walking on the asteroid ; Ryan was right ; he was becoming an expert .
va	3	He struggled slightly to take each step and had to be assisted by the astronauts to the contamination area to get help removing his flight suit .
va	3	After VIN suggested that their private stash might have to last for quite a while , they got through week two without drinking a drop .
va	1	He was searching for companies who wanted to open up a second center of operations , or a manufacturing plant , in his area of government .
va	4	" Allen Saunders , good to see you again ; a real general now , I see , " added Jonesy checking out the man 's rank .
va	3	Mr. Noble will be the fifth member on board , and will stay up there to help transfer our scientists into the safety of the station .
va	4	He knew that he was correct , especially when a member of the European government on the television feed said that was what he was worried about .
va	3	" Setting up exit hatch , " VIN responded , the only one now floating around checking the hatch for his entrance to check the station .
va	0	His idea to go into space was geared toward telling the American public what his company was doing , and make sure any interested parties stayed away .
va	2	" Also good news for you pilots , our newest shuttle , Sierra Bravo III for our radio communications is a third of the way to completion .
va	3	The thrusters will then need to slow it down to 6,700 miles an hour over the eleventh orbit as it rises up to the station .
va	4	With a pint of water each time , the crew managed to bathe themselves before putting the lower half of their space suits back on .
va	3	Then it would be Jonesy 's job to match her tumbling , and gently bring the craft down to where he thought was the best landing site .
va	2	Not only was it rotating slowly sideways at nearly two rotations an hour , it was very slowly rotating back over front , about once an hour .
va	4	They reached the bow of the large asteroid , and he slowed them and the front of the rock began to move ahead of them .
va	3	Jonesy also had to move the craft with the slow tumbling of the asteroid in two different directions and this was taking all his concentration .
va	3	" She certainly wants to get down there in a hurry , " said Jonesy , using the thrusters to rotate the craft over the wide crater .
va	4	VIN , Send your message that the eagle has landed , and also tell them I needed 70 percent thrust on both motors to bring her down .
va	3	They don 't care if Europe gets the fallout from an exploding shuttle , but they don 't seem to want Washington as a potential target .
va	2	" I 'm hoping for about two to four tons of precious metals , or at worst some iridium or rhodium , " replied Ryan .
va	0	During the first ten days , both men collected a thousand rocks , about a quarter of the smaller rocks from a large area around the spacecraft .
va	4	The reason for this emergency flight is that the magnetic pull on the metal rock is nearly as much as Earth 's gravity , maybe even more .
va	3	So , Ms. Sinclair , with your excellent flying ability and your extra thrust , you will attempt to help Mr. Jones lift off the asteroid .
va	0	" Kid , you can name it what you want , but that Russian vodka supplier will always be called the beer can in my book .
va	4	" Now , I know your mental capabilities needed to be checked out before they allowed you in the Air Force , Mr. Jones . "
va	2	You didn 't by chance pick up one of those nearly empty bottles from the beer can on your way through , did you ? "
va	1	Then I want you to hover out of the crater and find a landing zone on a flat surface and not inside any craters this time .
va	2	" Enough to refill my tanks from empty , and two 100 pound cylinders for you , about a quarter of a tank , " Maggie responded .
va	2	" I also have two full cylinders , but these craft hovering low over this powerful pull will use up a lot of our fuel . "
va	3	Jonesy , the front wall of the crater is a little lower than this side ; can you at least point her in that direction ? "
va	3	I 'm waiting until we are ten feet away from the wall and then I want to push us off with the right hand thruster .
va	3	" About 80 feet , where we started ; the craft is turning 90 feet ... watch our butt Jonesy ... about 100 feet ! "
va	3	" Thruster on , tanks at half , here we go , hold thumbs girls , " and he pushed the throttles forward to gain output .
va	0	Bill was currently at Edwards Air Force base , twenty minutes flying time away , and about to take off for Florida , and would swing by .
va	4	He enjoyed Europe and lived in three countries ; England , Germany and Portugal for 15 years before returning to Africa ; Cape Town in 1989 .
va	1	The ribbons marked the route taken by Archie 's brother , Ed , who was trying to fly from England to Australia in under four days .
va	1	Mr. Watson , a.k.a ' The Screaming Skull ' , was a skeletal little man whose skin was stretched impossibly tight over his bald head .
va	3	" That 's what you get for building a city on a swamp , " he thought to himself as he buttoned up his overcoat .
va	0	He was an expensive wax model , looking tanned and unshaven in torn clothing with a bandage around his leg and a tangled mat of dark hair .
va	3	He lent forward and slid the book out from under the figure 's hand , half expecting it to protest and grab him by the wrist .
va	1	His vision started to return , which in normal circumstances would have been a good thing , but on this occasion Andy wasn 't so sure .
va	3	" Yeah sure , " said Tim , " But if anyone catches you with that thing , I don 't know anything ; OK ? "
va	4	The two of them walked around the corner to meet Tim 's mother Kim , who was waiting to pick them up in her ancient VW Beetle .
va	1	" Umm , just looking for something we saw in an old exhibit in the museum Dad , " said Tim , looking a bit anxious .
va	0	After a quick search he found a pencil , a ruler and a piece of paper and set to work carefully drawing a picture of the Talisman .
va	0	The Maya calendar , which is based around the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar , starts on a date equivalent to 11 August , 3114 BC .
va	3	From the 10th to the early 16th century , development in the northern centres and the cities of the northern lowlands in Yucatán continued to flourish .
va	1	Inscriptions show them on occasion working with sums up to the hundreds of millions and dates so large it would take several lines just to represent it .
va	2	Andy and Tim sat down to have their lunch under the shelter of a stone arch in front of one of the old classroom blocks .
va	0	" Well it says here that the Maya had their own calendar and the Romans had one of their own called the Julian calendar . "
va	1	" I 'm having the night off tonight and your father 's cooking , Tim , so I guess it 'll be fish and chips .
va	0	There was a screech Andy had never heard before as a rabbit sprang out of the bushes straight at the boys with Jake hard on its tail .
va	2	" Promise not to hurt me and I 'll tell you how I did it and I 'll prove to you I 'm from the future . "
va	2	In this bag I have technology from the 21st century and proof of what happened to your brother and what will happen to you . "
va	4	If so , I 'll spend a couple of days preparing , then I 'll be off at the first sign of suitable weather . "
va	2	" He looks more like the son of a conman come to lure my fool son out of what little money he hasn 't already squandered ! "
va	3	I 'd been using the computer all afternoon and was getting quite handy with it , so I thought I 'd take it up to father .
va	0	Picking up the bags he stepped up into a coach and led them down a narrow passageway before stopping at a door about halfway down .
va	2	I was hoping to pay later , but we have to go to Croydon to pay Tasker and make sure the Comet is up to scratch tomorrow .
va	2	" Well I had a few jobs to do in the village this morning , so I thought I 'd sort you out as well . "
va	0	Looking at the map I brought with me , I can see Singapore and Baghdad , but I can 't find an Allahabad or Batavia . "
va	0	" There 's Allahabad in the centre of India , but it appears Sumatra is now called Indonesia and the capital city Batavia is now Jakarta .
va	2	Inlaid on the top of the stone was a gold snake in the shape of an S. Andy felt sick looking at the bloodied ring .
va	0	Two looked like the one that was holding him , but the third was a huge ugly brute with a bandage on his right hand .
va	0	Shows you 've got no idea about what you 've got yourself into " The man spat as he talked and his breath was appalling .
va	1	The car carried on for another half hour or so , turning occasionally , starting and stopping but never really cruising for any length of time .
va	0	Andy looked towards the voice and saw a thin , pale man , immaculately dressed in a business suit with a bow tie and round spectacles .
va	2	" ' Cos I 'm going to make out I 've got some stolen gear to get rid of , so he 'll open the door . "
va	1	I said I didn 't want anything to do with kidnapping a child , but I was threatened with my life if I didn 't help them .
va	3	I just had instructions the other day that he would arrive with two others and that I was to help them with whatever they requested . "
va	1	" I think he 's told us most of what he knows , but I 'd like a word with him in private if I may . "
va	1	" Charlie , I have a story which is straight out of the realms of science fiction , but I swear on my life it is true .
va	2	In fact it is the reason why I have placed a large sum of money on two outsiders to win gold in the forthcoming Olympics . "
va	4	He gave the air of a confident man , but inside he felt real fear creeping into his stomach for the first time since the Great War .
va	4	They 'd arrived in a fabulously decorated chamber guarded by two massively built men , who tried not to look shocked at their sudden appearance .
va	0	The servant had flung the scalding hot soup in his eyes and was now standing over him with the empty pot hanging from his right hand .
va	4	He 'd seen hundreds of battles on TV and had killed thousands more bad guys in video games , but none of that compared to this .
va	4	In one fluid movement he spun , jabbed the guard in the ribs with his knife and then kicked his feet out from under him .
va	4	When they fell ill , I entered the dungeon to rescue you and the children while my people attacked the palace to get the Talisman .
va	4	Chapter Twenty Four The little jeweller was in the back room of the shop making dinner for himself and the huge man who was his guest .
va	2	What he hadn 't told him was that when carrying such a load they would need every foot of room Croydon airfield could give them .
va	1	He tried to reach inside his flying suit to get to the coin hanging round his neck , but their wild ride made it impossible .
va	3	" I 'm trying to gain a couple of thousand extra feet over the top of this pass to give us a bit of height to manoeuvre .
va	3	The poor little chap was only just getting settled in when I had to leave on this trip so I brought him with me . "
va	2	" You were lucky you 've got a mate running the show , " said Andy , sitting on the bed pulling his boots off .
va	1	I 've known ' im since ' e was a boy and if anyone can make ' is Lordship 's blood boil it 's ' im . "
va	0	Aside from the occasional flash of chalky white lightning and the pathetic illumination from his headlights , he could see nothing of the road ahead .
va	0	The man who had spoken from the front passenger seat was about Mike 's age , clean-cut and nondescript with shaggy brown hair and a medium build .
va	0	It was impossible to miss , for it was the same look he himself had cultivated a lifetime ago as a new CIA recruit at Langley .
va	4	Mike 's last thoughts , of his wife and children , flew through the back of his skull at four hundred and fifty feet per second .
va	3	Her flirting wasn 't lost on Kurt , but instead of acknowledging it , he took his beer , turned , and ambled out the front door .
va	4	Their mother appeared content to let her children burn off their energy , as she split her time between a magazine and watching them play .
va	3	It took only a few minutes to reach the airport , but the trip was the typical Peruvian obstacle course of deathtrap taxis hurtling over rutted roads .
va	0	He surveyed the late afternoon crowd , looking from face to face , making quick mental calculations about who was about to have a lucky day .
va	1	After Amelia and Heidi had died , the promise of the trip was his only lifeline , the only thing that kept him moving forward .
va	3	He didn 't bother with the lights ; there was still plenty coming in through the glass doors on the opposite side of the room .
va	1	As the last surviving Vetter son , an enormous responsibility was now on his shoulders ; it was a responsibility Kurt wasn 't quite sure he wanted .
va	4	He shifted his feet to the couch and stretched his body the full length , the rich leather crunching and crinkling as he made himself comfortable .
va	3	What he didn 't know , and couldn 't possibly fathom , was what was waiting for him on the other side of this experience .
va	0	His face was greasy , and his hair was a tangled nest of road grime , salt , sweat , and maybe even a few bugs .
va	3	The water finished boiling , but as he was about to pour it into the press , there was a sharp knock at the front door .
va	4	Seven Kurt punched his accelerator and shot across the highway into the church parking lot , skidding to a stop beside a shiny Mercedes SUV .
va	0	He held out the pack , and when Kurt shook his head , his father shrugged , knocked one out for himself , and lit up .
va	2	He was surprised and startled to find her sitting alone , staring into a cup of coffee , on a couch near the front door .
va	4	The act of performing a ' sneak and peek ' on a citizen was technically illegal , but the agency did it all the time .
va	3	Much to his surprise , he spotted Kurt Vetter right away ; twenty feet ahead , Vetter stood patiently , waiting to go through the security checkpoint .
va	3	They were almost at the point where they would separate into individual security lanes , and for a moment , Mason thought he had lost his target .
va	2	Mason had spent copious amounts of time in London over the years , to the point that it felt almost like a second home to him .
va	0	He couldn 't tell for certain if it was an American or British accent , it was so fast , but his gut said American .
va	2	Mason looked over the Sikh 's shoulder and saw to his dismay that there were now dozens of black taxis jostling for position on the street .
va	0	Jack could be an absolute tyrant , she had learned early on , but when he was getting his way , he was an angel .
va	4	The first thing he noticed was the stale odor struggling to compete with the thick smell of decades -- no -- centuries of fried meals .
va	0	He gave her the official version of Mike 's death , starting at the gas station and working his way up and through the funeral .
va	0	He was prepared to walk away , to catch a cab , and go back to his hotel if she wasn 't willing to give some information .
va	1	Two dots , representing the tracers on Kurt and Amanda 's phones , were moving in unison through central London , as Helen had said they would .
va	4	The Russian people were sick of poverty , sick to death of it , while the people in power longed for a return to the glory .
va	3	From that point on , it was only a matter of time before the government reconstituted itself and reasserted control over the day-to-day aspects of life .
va	0	He also dabbled in low-level terrorism for hire , contracting his seasoned fighters to assist in the fight against the Americans in both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
va	4	The building was old , yet appeared well maintained , with fresh paint on the exterior and decorative landscaping in most of the small yards .
va	4	At forty-two , Nigel had been in a wheelchair for only seven years , the result of a tragic rock climbing accident in the Pyrenees .
va	4	He had been in the same cramped position for the past hour , reviewing floor plans and security documents , trying to find a way in .
va	0	Satisfied with his plan and preparations , Mason inserted a magazine into the sniper rifle , chambered a round , and settled in to wait .
va	4	He could take Nigel this very moment and deal with Amanda and Vetter later , or he could be patient and get them at the same time .
va	4	He watched Nigel for a moment longer and then , with a controlled pull , he applied an even three pounds of pressure to the trigger .
va	4	He would have stayed , waiting to see who turned up , and she , like a good little soldier , had shown her face .
va	4	When she didn 't turn , he pulled one of the guns from the bag , making sure to keep the muzzle pointed at the floor .
va	0	Kurt knew enough French to understand Amanda was telling the woman he was sick to his stomach , that he hadn 't eaten in several days .
va	2	I ran her through the system , and it looks like she was roommates with the woman you 're been looking for , at Stanford . "
va	4	They had first been posted together in the embassy in Mexico City eight years earlier and had been tracking each other 's careers ever since .
va	0	She had said she didn 't know anyone , didn 't have any contacts , and that he would have to take her at her word .
va	0	It had heft , and he couldn 't help but imagine the animal that had once roamed the plains of Montana millions of years before .
va	3	It wasn 't until Darlene was tasked with monitoring traffic in the region that she picked out a pattern , a pattern the automated systems had missed .
va	3	The beauty of the crawler was that it would follow links automatically , expanding out from the initial terms to create a web of related activity .
va	1	Dominic took a deep breath , and Rick noticed a thin bead of sweat on his forehead , surprising since Dominic ran marathons in his spare time .
va	1	I think Buzz is in Afghanistan this week , " Dominic said , referring to the Secretary of Defense , Bill " Buzz " Dumfries .
va	4	Rick circled back around his desk and stacked the papers he had been reviewing , placing them in a folder with red stripes on the front .
va	1	Rather than a single room , there were over fifty , ranging from private quarters to planning and command and control centers for various agencies .
va	1	The soldier , a solid slab of killing muscle in his early twenties , shook his head as if to say he didn 't speak English .
va	4	It was all he could do not to take her into his arms , feel her body against his and tell her how he felt .
va	3	Lex tossed the controller at Ricky who had retracted into a ball with his knees drawn up to his chest at the far end of the couch .
va	0	Beyond the shooter was a clearing about the size of a baseball diamond infield with a rock face about the height of a pickup truck .
va	3	Tommy said looking at the trail that Ricky and Lex would have crossed had they not taken a detour over the berm to watch Tommy .
va	0	He could smell something that reminded him of a wet dog , so in his mind that 's what he thought was hiding from him .
va	4	As Ricky moved around the biggest red cedar tree he had ever seen he heard something that sounded like someone pushing air through his nose .
va	3	Chapter 2 : This Land is Your Land It was still dark when they heard the truck door slam in the driveway next to the kitchen .
va	4	Uncle Jeff cocked an eye toward his sister , unsure of whether he was annoyed or amused with the courage of the little fella to speak up .
va	4	" Well , I found enough of these smooth red stones in the bush up on the ridge to fill that garbage can , " Ricky said .
va	3	" Let 's move out guys , we have work to do today , " Jeff started back out to the trail with Lex close behind him .
va	1	Ricky was quick to gauge his uncle 's uneasiness but couldn 't resist grabbing a couple more of those smooth red stones for his pockets .
va	4	" Well , yeah , " Uncle Jeff gave Ricky and Lex a long sideways glance wondering if Karen had told these boys anything of their ancestry .
va	4	" Yeah , I know Mom , " Lex became the quintessential embarrassed teenager recoiling from his mother 's affection and prepared to peel the potatoes .
va	3	" But , I thought ... " Lex started to complain but his mother shot him a look that made him think better of it .
va	3	He quickly slid into his pants , shirt and boots and turned on the floodlights twenty feet up on a pole in the front yard .
va	3	This morning started out much more pleasantly with the boys salivating to the aroma of bacon in the air and the promise of lots of French toast .
va	4	These days most people refer to them as Sasquatch , which is the white 's version of the Salish people 's word for ' wild man ' .
va	0	Barely an hour ago he had found the hair snagged shoulder high on a hemlock sapling , just steps inside the bush next to his place .
va	2	" I 'd say all of you guys are too young to be in the bush with a rifle alone without supervision , " opined Uncle Jeff .
va	4	I don 't understand that , " Lex was thoroughly engaged in what Uncle Jeff had to say , just as Ricky seemed to be .
va	3	Uncle Jeff laughed , " Or you just don 't know how to think because you aren 't willing to take the time to figure it out ?
va	2	Ricky 's grasp on the import of his explanation didn 't seem to overwhelm him either , as he sat back and took out his iPod .
va	1	" It sure is clean , " said Ricky , " I 'll bet I could drink that water without any filter or chlorine . "
va	2	Lex was alone for five minutes or so and then he noticed a lone figure slowly closing in on his position from the direction he had come .
va	0	Gary really liked that one and was laughing as much at the joke as this new kid who was trying so hard to be his friend .
va	0	Ricky figured his friend was about a head taller than Lex , which made it taller than mom and about as tall as Uncle Jeff 's shoulder .
va	4	It was the Friday night before Halloween that Sunday that the boys had a sleep over and invited " one friend each " as directed by Mom .
va	4	" Well if you 've been here all of your life how come you 've never seen one of the Old One 's and I have ? "
va	3	They used the Playstation instead to search the Internet for information and watch Youtube videos into the early morning hours , long after Karen went to bed .
va	2	" Do you think you can find the spot up on the ridge where you found those smooth red stones once again , Ricky ? "
va	2	" Well , your uncle has taken you along the trails many times and you should know how to be safe in the bush by now .
va	0	" Good , " Gary raised the air horn above his head and let off a long blast until Lex grabbed the horn from him .
va	3	Tommy ignored his friend 's trepidation as the anticipation of a treasure just fuelled Tommy 's desire to get at what it was that was buried below .
va	4	The path itself looked like a dozen men had marched up and down along its length ; all of the ferns were stomped into the ground .
va	1	" Well , I think the boys found and took something from someone they shouldn 't have and now they are angry and want it back .
va	4	As he listened , still , without the crunch of gravel below his feet , came sounds of several entities moving about him off the road .
va	1	Terry sat at his desk , nursing his second cup of tea , surrounded by the sounds and smells of a large , working horse barn .
va	0	Chapter 4 George sat up on the flying bridge contemplating the approach to Panama and mentally thanking Hector for insisting he take on a professional skipper .
va	4	The area had seen its own share of violence over the years accompanied by illegal immigration from Central America , being just over the border from Guatemala .
va	4	He was pretty sure everyone thought he was dead which was just as well considering the possibilities if it came out that he was alive .
va	4	After McElroy had shot him in both knees down in Costa Rica he and George Mudd had left him to die taking off with Vance .
va	0	Using a local gangland murder a ' Kevin Callahan ' from Ireland had been identified by finger prints and dental records as the victim ... . .
va	4	One , the Frenchman , dropped out as he seemed to be more interested in the racing and training end of things rather than the breeding .
va	4	I know the girls still have some homework to do and it 'll be busy heading into Gloucester at this time of the evening . " .
va	1	Many people are of the opinion that a hospice is a dark , dreary place with old folk lining the walls waiting their turn to die ... .
va	4	Lou Phillips , aka Kevin Callahan , hurried along the pavement head down like everyone else as though somehow you would keep dryer this way .
va	3	Across the street , through the dirty mist thrown up by the traffic , he could see the Blythe Hill Tavern a favorite local watering hole .
va	4	" For sure , I can see the CCTV camera at the main entrance but as to how extensive it is I couldn 't say .
va	3	Cutting straight across the two story entrance lobby she called , " Margaret , can we get some tea or something in the study . "
va	3	" I don 't like not having any communication , " said George , " the VHF works OK but that 's just line of sight .
va	4	The silence was only broken by the sound of a tractor over by the barns and the frolicking of the foals in the nearby paddock .
va	0	Callahan , travelling as Lou Phillips , boarded the Leeds train at Kings Cross and settled in for the two and a half hour trip .
va	3	It was a normal morning with the exception that she missed George and their traditional morning conversation over breakfast , except it wasn 't normal at all .
va	3	We 've cut off a lot of the wire but some of it we don 't want to touch until Dr. Newnham is here . "
va	2	Rick , I want you to fly down to San Jose and hook up with a guy called Julio Pan , you can trust him implicitly .
va	0	Gary ... there is a ' threat ' so be on your guard ... maintain watches even though you 'll be at a dock , any questions ?
va	4	George has arranged a meeting with a local accounting firm who 've agreed to handle that end of things until we have our new offices built .
va	2	Of course the other thing is Connor Moylan , I 'm sure she told you about that issue and the background check that was done on him .
va	0	As last year , we have seconded ' Mudd Securities ' as a contractor which formalizes your involvement , David will act as liaison with MI5 . "
va	0	Also , David should stay at the farm for a while and we 'll get some recording equipment over as fast as we can ... . .
va	1	" Oh , I can drive you into town if you like , " said Jen , " it 's only a few minutes . "
va	3	" Not that I 'm trying to make light of things but I don 't think Kate and the kids are in any specific danger .
va	0	Chapter 21 " Thought I might go and visit my mother in Managua for a few days , would you like to tag along ? "
va	1	" I assume you think she might be on to something and we should go talk to her , " said Rick smiling at his new friend .
va	4	He lost his license to practice quite some time ago , his name is Eduardo de Ramirez de Arroyo , we know where he lives . " .
va	3	He 'd added another distribution point for the drugs , a group he didn 't know particularly well in Birmingham but that really wasn 't the issue .
va	1	" I 'd like you to give Connor a hand this morning if you don 't mind , Viv , he 's a little short handed .
va	4	She stayed under the speed limit , if she got pulled over there could be hell to pay , her ' handsfree ' gave a buzz .
va	0	Lying with the new toothpaste , nail clippers and a couple of Tampax a small cellophane bag , teaspoon , cigarette lighter and a disposable syringe .
va	3	He put everything back in the wash bag and tasted the content of the tiny bag on the tip of his little finger ... cocaine .
va	3	" You 're doing the right thing , darling , and I 've no objection to her staying at the farm while things get sorted .
va	2	" Oh , come on guys , " Jen in exasperation , " you said I didn 't know her and you 're absolutely right .
va	3	I 'm convinced that for either one to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion I need to be the unknown factor ... at least my whereabouts .
va	4	He 's convinced there 's some connection between what 's going on here at the farm , Kate 's disappearance and the business over in Central America .
va	1	" I 'm not putting up with this bullshit ... I 'm leaving , you lied to me , Jen , my own sister . "
va	0	" This chap ... his name is not Harry Fowler ... his name is Ronan Flaherty , he 's a petty criminal and drug dealer .
va	3	" That bitch ... that stupid fucking bitch ... let 's herself get into that position then goes along with it without saying a blasted word .
va	4	He was wearing the same crumpled clothes as the last time Rick had seen him except now he was wearing a sweat stained Panama hat .
va	0	Apparently Viv was a casual user of recreational drugs to start off with but Flaherty got her hooked on harder stuff and now she 's addicted .
va	0	" Any pub that has draft Guinness and Kilkenny can 't be all bad , " said Rafferty , " do you think he 'll come ? "
va	2	If you 're a really good boy you might only need a doctor if not it 'll be a priest you 'll be needing for sure . "
va	4	She also knew her period was almost due so she was going to have to talk to her minders and get the where with all .
va	3	" Looks as though it 's just the two of them , middle aged couple both in the kitchen ... no sign of missing subjects . "
va	3	" They started knocking it down in 2006 but then they put it on hold , not sure what 's happening to it now . "
va	3	They had started driving just for an hour each at a time as wrestling the heavy Toyota and dodging the constant pot holes was exhausting .
va	4	" I see you 've done this before , " said Connie laughing , " but you 're right you can 't be too careful . "
va	3	" Holy shit ... you don 't exactly travel light , " said Rick looking at the stack of suitcases on one of the beds .
va	3	Unfortunately the front of the building was quite close to the street with little cover although the lighting was poor , just an ineffectual yellow glow .
va	3	Two grey vans swung into the parking lot at the back of the building , turned around and parked in the driveway facing out towards the road .
va	3	Coming to his feet he was faced with two men , one carrying a suitcase , the other with an automatic weapon pointed right at him . "
va	4	Horses still have to be put out and brought in daily , they still have to be fed and shod and in some cases exercised .
va	2	" I heard from Robbie , " said George , " the plan went OK and nobody got hurt ... at least none of our guys . "
va	4	" The security people came for Flaherty this afternoon , " said Jen , " now we have to decide what to do with Vivien .
va	3	The last thing he saw was the muzzle flash in the grass , his last thought was what Margaret was going to do without him ?
va	4	" I 'm sick of being bitten by bedbugs , flees and God knows what else plus the food here is giving me the runs ! "
va	4	" Bit risky , Robbie , if the other guy comes out we 're screwed , if he makes a noise we 're equally screwed .
va	4	Hang on ... he 's stopped he 's lighting a smoke ... get down there right now ... nail him as he comes round the corner . "
va	4	I need you to keep an eye on the road , make sure the workers have headed into the mountains and not down the road .
va	0	So far there had been nothing untoward , traffic was normal and , as usual , pedestrian traffic was almost non-existent being a light industrial park .
va	4	Simple really , he 'd found the plan in Terry 's desk in an office to be converted into a reception area , lucky in retrospect .
va	4	He was highly aware of the slight noise he had made when entering and stood immobile letting his heart rate settle and trying to control his breathing .
va	3	" I thought we 'd lost you , " she murmured , " several times actually ... ... I must get the doctor . " .
va	4	George still got very tired easily and had fallen asleep in the chair so Jen had grabbed the opportunity to catch up on the farm mail .
va	1	I 'm sorry I missed one of those bastards , if I 'd been a bit sharper you 'd not be in that chair . "
va	0	Eventually , after far longer than it should have taken to read a few thousand words , Josh raised his head and gazed out the window .
va	2	Come with me , we 'll have some nosh and I 'll show you how to be social when you 're on the road . "
va	4	" I 'm sorry , " the man on reception explained , " some of our hostels are only open at certain times of the year .
va	3	The latte didn 't look up to Starbucks ' standard but the mug was warm and she 'd tipped in sufficient sugar to mask any unwanted taste .
va	4	I 've been swinging through the trees like Tarzan or following an Aussie I only just met up mountains I 've only just heard of ?
va	4	She heard a loud noise coming from Ruth 's end of the phone and for once was relieved to have their conversation cut short by her niece .
va	4	She tried to keep the jealous note of enquiry out of her voice but something in Josh 's smirk suggested she wasn 't entirely successful .
va	1	Josh held up his hands , palms forward , and took a step back , as if giving the girls space to discuss him at length .
va	2	If you choose to hook up with every woman under the age of fifty that passes your way that 's no concern of mine . "
va	4	Claire dipped her paddle in the water and pushed her craft forwards , concentrating on her technique so Josh had nothing else to sneer at .
va	2	" Why , are you worried that you 'll bump into me again or do you think you 'll get tired of the gruesome twosome ? "
va	1	This blog is meant to record the excitement of a life lived outdoors ; the thrill of hiking , biking , abseiling and rock climbing .
va	1	Having received some bad news I was grateful to climb into my basic little car , drive along quiet winding roads and let my mind be still .
va	3	The haunting melody took her back to university days - battling hangovers and fatigue to churn out essays so that she could go party with her friends .
va	0	Also by Amanda Martin : BABY BLUES AND WEDDING SHOES Amanda 's latest release , the chick lit novel Baby Blues and Wedding Shoes is available now .
va	1	Readers with an appreciation for a bit of reality and a bit of hopeful romantic wishful dreaming will not be disappointed by this lovely tale .
va	1	On returning to Australia , Adrian was required to learn English in order to complete High School and pursue his interest in Physics at University .
va	1	The soft swish of Shadow 's skis , the frozen snow and the cold on his face heightened his awareness as the target area was fast approaching .
va	0	He took advantage of a noticeable track used by the sentries and local animals , and followed it to within visual distance of the target .
va	4	With the exception of two spies , one being ' Shadow ' , every spy since the end of World War 2 has gone through this program .
va	1	Within minutes his pistol , fitted with a silencer , commenced firing rounds in several directions , hitting each target twice before moving onto the next .
va	3	All Agent 2C knew about the target was that he had been on the Most Wanted list in 12 countries for the past 8 years .
va	4	Once the house was cleared , she moved to the door leading into the courtyard where she noticed the used parachute and her dead guard .
va	0	On his fall he caught a branch and carried out a full rotation around it with the ability of a " high bar " gymnast .
va	0	Shocked by the shark and panicked by the lack of air , he had released his dad and paddled as fast as he could to the surface .
va	4	She explained that although she remembered that day , she had felt that both he and his dad 's eyes had showed exhilaration and not fear .
va	2	" Light Boy ... " , a nickname given to him by local gangs , " ... we both know this not social meet lah . "
va	1	He felt the adrenaline pumping through him giving him courage to stand clearly in the open , holding a brick in front of his right eye .
va	4	As he sat down on an old brown leather couch , he looked up at the yellowed photos of his dad displayed on the mantelpiece .
va	0	The man he saw this morning was obviously a professional and , if he attempted another kidnapping , he would wait for a better , safer opportunity .
va	3	" Mum , I am not really angry about the secrets , it 's just that I don 't know how to deal with it .
va	3	I am scared of losing you and I am upset with myself that I am letting anger spoil what is quickly becoming our last moments together . "
va	1	Simon suddenly felt the back of his hair stand up and his mouth instantly dry up as his mother 's words echoed in his mind .
va	3	Simon sat transfixed and listened intently as his mother told him that his father was involved in a drug bust in Germany , at the Hamburg seaport .
va	1	After a long pause Candice continued : " One night whilst working in the emergency ward , a critically wounded man had been brought in .
va	2	I don 't know why he 's looking for you , but I don 't think he 's the long lost friend he claims to be .
va	0	The man just smiles wearily and said that he knew he was in a bad way and probably would not make it through the night .
va	0	He had thought that this was a way his mother could still feel close to his dad , knowing that he had once visited these places .
va	3	" In that case , I 'll see you in two days " stated Simon thinking that he could buy a little more time to think .
va	3	" Simon , the doctors think I have only a month to live , but they can 't tell me how fast my tumour is growing .
va	4	Treviso was not located by the sea , but was built on the river using a similar concept as Venice -- suspended on special pontoons - .
va	3	All that I can tell you is that it is somewhere in central Italy and the town is surrounded by the walls of an ancient castle .
va	3	In the back of his mind he did not trust the stranger 's true intentions : would he have told him of his plans so easily ?
va	4	At that point Deepa entered the room with a tray holding Mango juice , a basket full of toasted bread , Vegemite and English breakfast tea .
va	3	" A lifetime ago , I went to Australia for work and over the two months that I spent there I came to love it .
va	2	Candice , I ran into the doctor down the corridor and he will be coming to see you at the start of his morning rounds .
va	4	Simon did not stop to ask how the inspector knew that he would be leaving on his adventure and may need all the help he could get .
va	2	" I thought I would wait for you here , as the hotel was becoming uncomfortable , " said a hoarse whisper coming from the double couch .
va	2	You are left-handed ; you could probably outrun me if it came down to a chase ; something I would not recommend as I am armed .
va	1	" No Simon , this is a case of having the Air Traffic control director as my brother-in-law " replied the inspector with a smile .
va	2	I do not know how you managed to have Lau vouch for you and frankly , I think the less I know the better it is . "
va	2	To his fortune , shortly after Simon took off from Malaysia , he found that amongst his gifts from inspector Lau there was an MP3 player .
va	4	With one hour to go before landing in Germany , somewhere near Berlin , the pilot took a break and came to sit next to Simon .
va	1	In order to allow Simon to stretch his legs for a little while without raising suspicions , the pilot provided a flying suit for him to wear .
va	3	The experience of attempting to stay within the toilet boundary whilst moving through a bit of turbulence was at first a novelty but within seconds became annoying .
va	2	" So Morten , you very young to be in Air Forces " mentioned Franco in broken English whilst looking at the flight suit worn by Simon .
va	4	Beppe , despite being a man of few words often followed by a soft grunt , seemed to have an unlimited amount of energy stored within him .
va	0	A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling instead of a ceiling fan , and instead of his desk there was a huge dark brown oak wardrobe .
va	0	In Germany , a tall blonde man stood outside a NATO base speaking to one of the local ground crew about a recent flight from Malaysia .
va	4	' Beta ' then walked towards the secret exit , whilst feeling satisfied that he managed to get # 500,000 more then he actually required .
va	0	Shortly after arriving in Bagdad , Luca was exposed by one of his contacts and assassinated in the middle of the day at a local market .
va	2	Unable to shake this thought out of his head , he decided to visit Silvio for a glass of vino and a slice of panettone .
va	3	He initially felt gutted that another agent was on route to replace him on the current mission , possibly resulting from his failure in Malaysia .
va	0	The floor was made of dark timber and was partly covered by an intricate carpet that depicted a battle between the Romans and the Barbarians .
va	0	Realising how much he was in danger , Simon decided to duck walk slowly to a nearby car and scan the area before standing up again .
va	1	" I was thinking of taking him to see the Duomo and the museum , " replied Beppe with a wink in Simon 's direction .
va	2	So , out of love , he decided to go abroad and make sure that I would never hear from him nor about his missions .
va	1	He had a second Dan in Jujitsu and , in addition to his native languages German and English ; he also spoke French and Latin .
va	1	" Well , at least I can commend you for your taste in clothing " , replied Whisper whilst giving a hint of a smile .
va	0	The plane flight was initially supposed to land in Germany and head back , but it was diverted to Italy to an airport near Treviso .
va	4	" Although many years have passed , I still have nightmares about the funeral " added Simon remembering the sense of loss he had experienced .
va	3	He told her that it was a place many Italians go to for their honeymoons , and that it 's not frequented by many tourists . "
va	3	" He did also mention that it was somewhere in central Italy , and that the town was surrounded by the walls of a castle .
va	0	He was not too pleased about being assigned to an assassin , but he was sure that MI6 had a valid reason for the decision .
va	0	He took advantage of the fact that the old man was distracted by Simon 's departure and kicked his legs with all of his available strength .
va	3	Beppe , angry with himself for being distracted , could not do anything but simply throw his arms back to reduce the impact of the fall .
va	0	He was hoping that it would wind the old man and allow him enough time to break away from the fight and chase his primary target .
va	2	I 'll just follow him from a distance " replied Steve , although had no intention of doing so - it was a matter of pride .
va	1	Simon managed to keep his bike moving forward at high speeds , whilst utilising the lack of traction to assist in drifting the Vespa around corners .
va	0	As the bike slid into a natural gutter caused by years of land corrosion , the tyres jammed and caused the bike to jack back up .
va	3	The Taxi driver thought about it for a few moments and then offered to sell him an old motorbike that he had in his garage .
va	4	Although he was excited to see his mentor again , he felt that it was improbable , as his master would never jeopardise Nicola 's hidden identity .
va	3	It didn 't take them long to find a truck with a number plate from Bari -- a capital city located at the heel of Italy .
va	4	" Hello young man , I 've got you a gelato from the Gelateria that won the world ice-cream championship in 2005 " offered the old master .
va	2	Give your body a night 's rest to recover from today 's beating , and then continue with our search for your papa tomorrow . "
va	2	" Sure , but wait until tomorrow as you look exhausted and right now the call would be difficult for you to deal with emotionally . "
va	0	Instead of the mirror , Simon and Beppe found themselves staring at a minibar , a remote control , two loaded pistols , and a small safe .
va	4	" Well , I think I might have found where the medicine cabinet might be " replied Simon as he pressed a button with a red cross .
va	4	However , he decided not to , as he did not want to risk having the message traced and thus giving away his dad 's hideout .
va	0	Kiara , was an only child and had been strongly encouraged to study law by both her parents who were both Queen 's Counsels in Australia .
va	1	I hope he was at least luckier than us in finding accommodation in town , " stated Whisper in the hope of gaining some more information .
va	2	Simon asked , whilst listening to her voice in the monitor , thanks to a hidden parabolic microphone installed on the roof of the apartment .
va	4	They might be waiting in nearby villages , hoping that their lack of presence in town will encourage us out of hiding " directed Beppe .
va	3	" Not that I 'm ungrateful , but why is it that both you and dad lean towards the BMW as your car of choice ? "
va	3	According to the onboard computer , at night the front screen was developed to enhance ambient light , so that the driver could drive without headlights .
va	4	Unfortunately , over the years we started to lose money as many of the regulars passed away and the tourists found our meals too simple . "
va	4	By the time they had finished , they had drunk copious amounts of wine and liqueurs and Beppe was barely able to walk back to the car .
va	1	You might end up being disappointed when it turns out to be a boring story , " replied Simon , whilst offering her a big grin .
va	3	Simon did not want to bring his mum back to Italy just to experience the same disappointed that he had felt in the last few days .
va	2	" You know Simon , if you come back with your mother , you will have the privilege of a regular hot breakfast cooked for you ! "
va	3	Unfortunately , the ship carrying the drugs sank in the Pacific Ocean , but that didn 't stop the drug supplier still wanting his money .
va	4	Due to the usage of the short barrel , which was initially developed for close quarter combat , this weapon was ideal to be used in vehicles .
va	0	Despite a fixed smile , he had an intimidating air about him that was most likely created by his stature and the scars across his face .
va	3	" Kid , if we want to get through this we cannot afford to have the both of us changing an empty magazine at the same time .
va	2	Knowing my luck I will not only be unable to sew up the hole , but I will also struggle to remove the blood stain ! "
va	4	The second screen showed a closer view , taken by an agent currently hiding in an apartment near the location where the third vehicle had been hit .
va	4	Although they provided covering fire whilst leapfrogging from one vehicle to the next , they were pleased to see that nobody was returning any fire .
va	3	Although Boris instantly fell to the ground , this time he did not show the pain that he felt from the second bullet hitting him .
va	4	After a few seconds he watched the Italian gentleman extending his arm in the direction of the camera whilst holding something small and rectangular in his hand .
va	3	Unfortunately , the reality is that the nightmares will eventually catch up to you and stay with you for the rest of your life . "
va	4	For years I tried hard to lose them , ... but as time went on I realised they were my saviour from insanity and evil . "
va	4	When Candice opened the door , she found herself staring at an older gentleman wearing a tailored grey suit and holding two bunches of Tulips .
va	1	Shortly after your mum and I arrived in Hong Kong we were invited for dinner by our neighbours , Signor Beppe and his wife Maria .
va	0	Interestingly Tulips are not a native European flower , but in fact they are traditionally from a mountain range located between Afghanistan and Pakistan " explained Beppe .
va	4	The food was accompanied by great wine , lots of laughter , and serenity not felt by any of the guests for a long time .
va	2	" Signor Beppe , when I told you about my story back in Treviso , you told me that you would help me find my dad ! "
va	0	What he also found amazing was that his trainer was most likely a double agent - Steve knew that this would come in handy one day .
va	1	Therefore , he grabbed Simon 's striking leg with his right arm whilst kicking at his other leg in the hope to throw Simon off balance .
va	4	Unable to keep eye contact , Steve instinctively glanced just to the right of Simon 's shoulder where the answer was suddenly clearly in focus .
va	3	The intimidating behaviour worked as planned as a young family , out of fear , decided not to insist on getting into the capsule with the boys .
va	4	The bullet exited the mobile via the aerial , which also acted as a barrel and travelled at high speed across the chamber towards its target .
va	1	Simon saw Steve smiling and took advantage of the pause by filling his lungs with air and blowing the glass at his opponent 's eyes .
va	4	Using the pendulum momentum , Simon brought his feet up so that they ended in between his hands resting on the under section of the beam .
va	4	Simon saw that Steve was not continuing his descent , and instantly knew that he was taking a stance where the odds would be more even .
va	3	Although the two teenagers were now almost half way down , they both knew that a fall from this height would result in their death .
va	3	Steve , not wanting to lose the advantage , took a step forward on his right and swung the left leg towards his adversary 's head .
va	3	Although the move prevented the kick reaching its target , the strength was sufficient to throw Simon backwards against the spikes at one end of the hub .
va	4	After a few minutes , just as the police were making their way through the crowd , Simon attempted to stand up and flee the scene .
va	0	I 'll have a car take you to Heathrow airport as I realise you have some friends back in Italy waiting to say their farewells .
va	0	Wolf Eyes said , " When I was a young brave , I was part of a hunting party led by my Uncle Night Walker .
va	3	The hunters told their story about how they had tracked the bear and how the bear had stopped in the stream to catch a fish .
va	3	They looked at each other for an instant , and then both of them took off running to see who could get to the river first .
va	4	Loot said , " It is easier for me to sense the spirit of a reed than it is for me to sense my own spirit .
va	4	Fire Cub said , " We can 't sense our own spirits now , because we are spirits at the same time we are human beings .
va	4	Wolf Eyes and Red Talon drew back their bows , and when the deer crossed the trail , they released their arrows at the same instant .
va	3	Red Talon and Wolf Eyes each took a small portion of meat and threw it into the fire as an offering to the Great Spirit .
va	4	She said , " There are other people that are sick and injured , and I have to go back to care for them . "
va	3	" There it is , " she said , " just a little farther on down and under a giant bush that overhangs the water . "
va	4	When my fear let me , I crept back in , little by little , listening like a deer -- smelling the air like a deer .
va	3	There was a leather loop that would tether the handle to the wrist so that it could not be easily taken away by the enemy .
va	4	Waving Willow said , " I gave them some cornbread treat , a little while ago , but I guess they have finished it now . "
va	3	Still holding the spear in it and with one hand under the bottom of the fish , he raised it up out of the water .
va	3	When the Moon Spirit came on a clear night , he told the stars that he watched over the middle world on this particular night .
va	2	The gate was a narrow , overlapping parallel row of upright logs with just enough room for two men to pass , going in opposite directions .
va	4	There was nothing else to do but pile them up inside of it , and then come back and bury them later in a mass grave .
va	3	Three Baskets thought a long time , " Yes , I lost my mother , father and uncle , along with two brothers and a sister .
va	3	The lay of the land was not level , but was steep hills and valleys that caught the water and shed it toward the river .
va	4	When evening came , Wolf Eyes and Wounded Eagle went over the hill and found water in a small stream that ran down toward the river .
va	0	Wolf Eyes and Wounded Eagle again watched the changing of the guard and how it was done and what was said as the guards changed places .
va	4	That afternoon , when the sun got high , Wolf Eyes and Wounded Eagle watched as the workers in the cornfield returned to their village .
va	4	They reentered the palisade and turned to the right and ran silently along the fence , under the catwalk , where there were other guards posted .
va	4	When the view was clear , he signaled for the slaves to follow him , which they did , out the doorway one by one .
va	4	Wolf Eyes had expected that some of the Creeks would have run down the river to keep them in sight , but no Creeks had been seen .
va	0	Tranquil Lady answered , " He is a medium size man , always wears a mask , but has a big scar on his left shoulder . "
va	3	Their patience paid off , for then the flock lit in the trees right above them , and they blew darts until they ran out of them .
va	4	The wedding of Three Baskets and Red Talon was a simple ceremony held in the presence of friends , the chief and elders of the village .
va	4	On each end of the field was a goal made from two poles about twenty feet long with a cross piece on the top of them .
va	3	They would travel through the forest until they reached the river , and then it was the trail by the river that they would follow .
va	0	Chief Tuscaloosa made his entrance through a doorway in the back of this room , followed by wives and servant girls that carried large fans .
va	0	Chief Tuscaloosa rose and said , " I will call a council meeting for tonight , and you can have the number of warriors that you need .
va	4	There was an open pavilion where they could relax in the shade of its roof , while they waited for the convening of the council .
va	4	He rose and asked them if they were ready to go into the council house , as the council was ready to hear from them .
va	4	Some of the villagers loaned them hides to make themselves more comfortable , as the people wanted the warriors to gain strength back from their traveling ordeal .
va	3	In the booth he would store the potions that were used to bring on the spirits to entice the warriors in to a frenzy of madness .
va	4	The dancing warriors , though drunken and having such a wild time , started to make their way out of the circle one by one .
va	4	The warriors drank their portion , and as they did , the faces on the cups became magnified as they tried to focus on them .
va	3	He got to his feet and saw that Wounded Eagle was starting to stretch his limbs to get loose , so he did the same .
va	3	This part of the forest had not been burnt off , so it had brambles and obstacles to avoid if one was to travel through it .
va	2	Chief Broken Bow met with his principal men and let them know that Black Scorpion would show up at his village , sooner or later .
va	3	He looked up at the sky , which was turning a gray color with streaks of red that originated from the setting sun on the horizon .
va	3	They did not bother to rest that night in the woods , but made all speed that they could muster back to Chief Broken Bow .
va	2	Black Scorpion walked to a pool , and from it he produced a jar of evil potion , which he brought back to the fire .
va	2	Wolf Eyes will come out to look for the one who scared her , and we will be waiting for him , " said Black Scorpion .
va	3	The light from the men 's torches did not shine on any wall to the left , but was lost in the spaciousness of the caverns .
va	4	When the wolf grabbed the meat to run off , he stepped in the loop , and Wolf Eyes pulled hard to close the snare .
va	3	The sun heated the bricks to toasting warmth and resting upon it was the best way to enjoy down time from watching her little brother .
va	1	So instead of Stinky curling into a circle like she normally would when she was in doubt , she urged Hailey to join her in looking .
va	4	They were an odd sight as Hailey darted over to the wood pile and Stinky hung on for the first Lizard ride in her life .
va	4	But the phrase really did express her feeling about how the dragonfly twins could bounce above the pool with so little resistance from the air .
va	2	" No we don 't , but we can hold our breath , and float , and wiggle our tails just enough to save ourselves .
va	4	She avoided the strike of the Hag Spider , flashed past the right side of the Spider as she snapped her tail like a whip .
va	2	Where most Lizards were right side strong , also known as right footed , Noah had been born as one of the few left foot strong Lizards .
va	1	Gently pushing the Lizard back inside she said " I know Dad wouldn 't be happy if something happened to you , little old Lizard .
va	4	She wanted the comfort of the heat of the sun one more time , the way she and Hailey had shared it many times before .
va	4	As he felt the smothering heat of the day wrapping around him too he saw the pool shone blue in the middle of the yard .
va	4	As wonderful as it had been over the last year , there was no family left for him in the yard with the deep blue pool .
va	1	When it was within inches of them Noah exerted a strong hip twist that surprised the weaker Lizard , which loosened its grip on his tail .
va	4	He knew once he began moving he would need to continue without stopping until he found a place where he would be safe for a long time .
va	4	So they agreed Mariposa would head south up the hill the next morning since she 'd already had a bird 's eye view of the surrounding landscape .
va	3	It 's time , she thought , to get out of the den and figure out how to get the eggs moved to a new home .
va	1	After blocking the opening into the den with a wall of sand , Hailey ran into the underbrush to the north towards Nora 's garden .
va	1	With a silent swish of his tail , which was twice as long as his body , he was gone into the background of brush .
va	0	After an hour of foraging and snacking in the dead leaves and twisted vines of Lantana and Honeysuckle , Hailey found the pyramid of well stacked bricks .
va	4	Alligator Lizards do not sleep through Southern California winters because there are many bright and warm days in between the odd weeks of cold and rain .
va	4	A Mouse 's life is too short , he thought as he sat near the giant lava rock warmed by the late afternoon sun in November .
va	4	Watching with only one eye open , Miguel waited until the Spider disappear into the old Squirrel hole at the base of the Orange tree .
va	0	She saw him sprawl on his back , suck the juice from an Orange , and slip the rind into the hat , barely lifting the board .
va	0	Chapter 32 : The Ground Squirrels He whistled when he spoke , his breath coming in wheezing gasps from his thick chest through his two yellow teeth .
va	1	Sylvia was concerned , because she did want to use the Rattlesnake skin as soon as possible , to roll her pups in it for protection .
va	4	So Sylvia followed him through the interconnected burrow systems for their colony which traced like a city of streets beneath the roots of the many Orange trees .
va	1	His day-time activity had taught him to check twice and with the second visual sweep of his surroundings he saw two Snakes closing upon the Mice .
va	3	He decided the only solution to saving them was to wait to alert them at the last moment and direct them to run uphill to him .

va	0	Although not drunk she and her friends had sipped on a few gins already that afternoon and had reached the stage of laughing too loudly .
va	0	All was going well until a beat up builder 's van pulled out of a suburban side road , Ancaster Drive , ahead of me .
va	1	Like I say , nothing obviously useful like a baseball bat so unless I wanted to play some sports whilst I waited I was stuffed .
va	4	Security lights on the side and rear of his house lit the scene with a harsh , brilliant glare that made the shadows even deeper and darker .
va	1	The padlock was still dangling from its hasp so I locked them in and threw the key as far as I could into the bushes .
va	1	The wind blew against the side of my car but inside I felt all warm and secure inside like I was snug in a cocoon .
va	3	Getting out , I noticed the wind had got up and blew in a flat whine over the field and it cut though my clothes .
va	3	It was identical to the other five units in this part of the industrial complex except for the shell company 's sign above the door .
va	4	Me , I wouldn 't let a drop of it pass my lips but maybe the East Europeans ' stomachs were much stronger than mine .
va	3	I would have liked to put the rottweiler out of its misery but I didn 't want to risk a second bullet on the animal .
va	3	Turning the corner back onto Boston Road , I pulled up at the kerb and then slowly walked back in time to watch the fun .
va	2	So I made more gestures but then had to drop back behind the Luton as a Ford Mondeo was bombing down the road towards us .
va	3	I jogged to my Audi , took out my last Molotov , lit its tampon wick and tossed the bottle into the Luton 's cab .
va	3	That must have been the boat that brought in the immigrants , I thought , as I made a note of the number painted on its side .
va	2	" You ever get an urge for a feel of some tits , why don 't you just play with your own man boobs ? "
va	3	After I wiped up the last of my sauce with my toast , I stood and left a pound as a tip on the Formica top .
va	0	I bobbed out of the way with a fraction of an inch to spare and felt the airflow as his fist sailed past my ear .
va	3	" Your Dad 's asked me to take you home instead -- and then I 'll take this useless lump onto the Grantham and District Hospital . "
va	0	As well as the usual dog-eared folders and text books and a small toilet bag containing make-up and emergency sanitary protection I found her smart phone .
va	1	Listen , one last chance , throw your hand in with me and I 'll make you my second instead ... " I laughed at this point .
va	1	I 'm not telling you which direction we headed nor how far I drove as the Serious Organised Crime Agency might find that information of use .
va	1	I can 't say I was sorry as I was fed up with eating fries with mayo -- it was playing havoc with my waistline .
va	2	We shook hands and on the way back to his farmhouse , I filled my boss in on how I 'd got on with Finnigan .
va	4	A brown UPS courier van made a delivery but other than that , the place was as quiet as it had been at three in the morning .
va	4	" Here it is , if you please , each page has been mounted in a special frame and you can see it all here . "
va	4	I will give you a piece of advice : imagine what you would like to happen at school with each teacher and in each lesson .
va	1	He didn 't like being with the adults and listening to their conversations and he was really irritated by the insincerity and histrionics of their children .
va	3	He may just be a small brook , running swiftly next to his close relations but steady streams will always find their way to the big river .
va	3	A magnificent giant of a city with its wonderful architecture , parks , lakes and the most radiant flowers planted right outside people 's houses .
va	3	" As you so rightly noted it indeed does live on because you continue to think about it and with some rapture I must say .
va	2	This summer you and your brother will find yourselves in some very strange situations in which you 'll learn a lot about yourselves and your family .
va	3	The road twisted so sharply and the sun changed its position so quickly that it felt as if the mountains were playfully throwing it to each other .
va	3	" But what about mum and grandmother aren 't they going to get worried when they find us gone , " the brothers wanted to ask .
va	4	Part 2 Michael and Ben 's Adventures With a feeling of joy mingled with excitement and fear Michael and Ben flew off into the unknown .
va	2	Under the light of a bright orange sun , birds would fly and flowers would bloom so that you could even smell their wonderful aroma .
va	4	The red sun gave the animals greater energy as they went out to hunt and caused the trees to produce the most astonishing variety of fruits .
va	4	Michael looked with gratitude at the Angel and he smiled back : " God promised that the earth would never experience such a flood again . "
va	3	But at that moment the boys heard the Angel 's voice : " Stop playing silly games with your imaginations and quickly hide in the forest . "
va	3	But Darya only angrily replied : " Don 't you go looking at the Turks and don 't expect anything but trouble from them . "
va	0	Her fair hair was plaited into a long pony tail which stretched down to her waist and her head was decorated by a garland of white flowers .
va	4	Michael and Ben immediately jumped up onto their horses and in the same instant everyone on board could see and feel the raft under their feet .
va	3	At first no-one noticed that they had come in , the mother was busy at the stove and the father was making something at the window .
va	0	Marko and Darya got married , but the wedding was a sad affair , they had both gone through too much and suffered too many losses .
va	4	The boys had the impression that one only needed to step into the screen to be transported to the scene depicted on it in real life .
va	3	At the last second Nina and her two small children got into the last lorry that was so packed that you could barely stand up .
va	0	Literally the next day his wife ran to the head of the SS and showed him Ivan 's diploma proving that he had graduated from a seminary .
va	3	They put the case on the table so that its contents would be visible to the guards and then muttered something totally incomprehensibly in German .
va	3	Sometime later the petty tyrant was removed from his post and Ivan was even sorry that he had sent his letter to the senior authorities .
va	3	But most importantly he restored the old bridge that spanned the huge fifty metre cliffs separating the Old and New parts of the town from each other .
va	0	Having played their fill in the building the children , with the boys ' grandmother amongst them , would happily run down to the river .
va	4	To all their questions the Angel simply replied : " We have no time to waste ; I will explain everything on the way . "
va	3	They firmly understood that it was vitally important that they find the Divine Star that was so priceless to the whole of their family line .
va	3	Yes , yes this story has a direct link with your family line and pay close attention to this story because it is very instructive .
va	0	It is a most a mystical story almost on a par with a fairy tale ... " Once upon a time there was a Princess .
va	1	The Princess 's soul is in a state of constant agitation because a small part of her spirit is being held by the servants of Satan .
va	3	First we will give you as much information as we can gather on the City of the Robots and most importantly a secret map of the city .
va	4	" You know , " the scientist continued , " not long before this disastrous assignment I had an extremely heated debate with an eminent evolutionist .
va	4	" Now we are going to strengthen your spirit because you are going to face some serious tests , therefore we will start with your parents .
va	4	Michael and Ben felt the rays on their skin and they felt as if they could literally hold them in the palms of their hands . "
va	0	" Oh dear God , that means that this boy has been captured for being a Christian , " said Michael to Ben in horror .
va	4	The lion continued to sleep peacefully on the other side of the arena and didn 't even twitch an eyelid at the appearance of the poor boy .
va	1	In two bounds Ben had caught up with the young scamp and had gently put him in an arm lock face down on the floor .
va	3	It had not occurred to any of them that the boys could have run into the church but the cathedral was full of peace and serenity .
va	0	The woman was taken aback and mumbled : " You 're a good boy , " and then quickly scuttled off and really did hail a taxi .
va	3	The restoration artist does not know all the details of your mission but does know that he needs to help and protect in whatever way he can .
va	4	" The water hasn 't been turned on here for a long time so all life here is dying out , " ' dad ' answered .
va	4	The faucet was located in one of the canal 's well holes directly under the city walls about one hundred metres from the gate . "
va	3	They have a small camera sewn into them that can fix on to all living things and radiation that differs from those given off by the robots .
va	2	You mustn 't talk to each other at all , especially outside the house , and when you 're indoors you should only communicate via the computer .
va	4	Michael and Ben had no idea what advice to ask from ' dad ' , because they had never been in this sort of predicament before .
va	4	Firstly , energy can be both negative and positive , what 's more good deeds increase a person 's energy but evil deeds exhaust their energy .
va	0	The only animals in the whole place were rare endangered birds and animals that had been stuffed and put on display in glass cases along the walls .
va	3	In the morning the boys left for the outskirts of the city with the worker 's outfit that ' Dad ' had acquired for the security expert .
va	4	But they had only managed to take a few steps before they were greeted by the howl of a siren and a terrible racket behind them .
va	0	But there was one spectacle that particularly stuck in Michael and Ben 's memory : a squadron of open topped aeroplanes parading along the boulevard .
va	3	But the Angel was not standing next to him at the time and instead replied thought with thought : " That is the Archangel Michael . "
va	3	They didn 't like to go to the communal summer camps but going to the seaside with their mum and dad was a completely different matter .
va	2	" Human beings cannot foresee everything but you , Sophia , fought so hard for your son that your efforts were nothing short of miraculous .
va	4	Then the Angel spoke up : " No , this is not paradise , but after a lot of hard work one can rest here .
va	4	One of them had a big screen rather like one of our computers , the screen was continually lighting up with new bits of information .
va	4	But she soon awoke and sensing someone near her she opened her eyes and saw a small fragile old woman leaning over her and stroking her head .
va	4	I will leave you with this little bell , if you ever need me , ring it , and I will be sure to come . "
va	3	And there were their mother and father taking them on their first day at school , then music and sport lessons and then finally to the institute .
va	1	If you need any further explanations press the red button and don 't be afraid of anything , " said the Wise Old Man encouragingly .
va	4	However , with Natalie , on the contrary , it would have been better if she and her family had lived independently away from her parents .
va	3	As she used to say in her student days : " It was hurtful , annoying ... but not the end of the world ! "
va	0	And each suitcase also had a mysterious package containing a beautiful pair of lightly tinted sunglasses on a chain and instruction on how they should be used .
va	3	It was Sophia who was the first to find her tongue : " Listen Natalie , we forgot our swimming costumes at the pool . "
va	0	said Sophia trying to stop her sister but Natalie had already left the cabin and she had no choice but to follow Natalie 's proposal .
va	0	They literally hopped after the light arrows that lit up their way , and soon arrived at a small cabin with a large cross on the door .
va	3	In reply Natalie let her know with a number of equally colourful facial contortions that she thought it was nothing but a bit of nonsense .
va	4	But the general has at least shown a little bit of compassion and insisted that we are not exposed to a very serious dose . "
va	4	" We saw them and they seemed suspicious to us , which is why we turned round and immediately came to your room , " Sophia reported .
va	0	" Each of them has been issued with a very dangerous apparatus , which can shoot a ray of light and cause various degrees of injury .
va	1	As he was brought past in handcuffs he literally hissed at the sisters in spite : " I wouldn 't be so happy if I were you .
va	0	And no sooner had the words left her lips than the sharks and dark clouds disappeared in to thin air and the sea became calm again .
va	3	And with that Sophia took pity on them : " It will all be as you hope ; ultimately it 's all in your own hands . "
va	2	You have already done much to pave the way for your victory ; all that remains is for you to give it one final push .
va	4	He rose from the grass behind them , no more than ten yards from the drag man , as the rear member of the diamond was called .
va	3	In a distant draw to the left he pointed out the rough shelters of the Dog Chief 's wards in their neat rows , trainers at work .
va	4	Gan shot a look at the Priestess and blushed just as the newcomer jerked his sword arm up in invitation for the crowd to cheer .
va	1	It always made Gan think of nettle leaves , so ordinary on the surface , with a surprising , vicious sting hidden on their undersides .
va	3	The sibilant thing that listened for the notes responded , but the sheer weight of activity seemed to daze it , overwhelm it with opportunity .
va	1	The woman who wasn 't Church earned her way into the King 's Hall by hanging onto her man with an unending show of infantile dependence .
va	4	They had lived in the days of First Church , which tripped herself with the declaration that her Teachers were on the brink of a new world .
va	4	Instead of apprehension , she was filled with a wild sense of freedom ; no one would ever take her self away from her again .
va	0	We 've already taught you to read and write , but now you can even learn a foreign language -- if you can afford lessons .
va	4	It was a bold jest , using Church 's name for the place of afterlife punishment , comparing it to the fire and noise of his work .
va	3	He 'd thought at the time the thing looked like the door on a bank vault , and had taken an inexplicable dislike to it .
va	0	Falconer paused , and something in his manner caused Conway to tense , but the answer came with a softness and consideration that was a surprise .
va	2	As the first was forced , it cracked loudly , followed immediately by a shrill , startling squeal as the locking bolt backed out of its hole .
va	2	From the corner of his eye , Conway caught Falconer 's frown , and followed the Colonel 's troubled gaze to the point of his concern .
va	0	The only one to make any headway toward understanding what any of it did was Leclerc , and all he 'd identified was the air circulation system .
va	4	Her companion , a plump young woman , more motherly in manner than her years would seem to indicate , shushed Carter , clearly embarrassed .
va	0	Before Conway realized what was happening , he was on his toes , his collar twisted in Falconer 's fist , his breathing almost totally cut off .
va	4	" He 'll be a leader , and a leader has to have the heart to strike with all his strength when he sees an opening .
va	1	Just as she inhaled deeply and remarked on the savory smells of burning wood and cooking , a woman 's voice called out names and announced dinner .
va	3	They slit my cheek and put a metal strip through it , then pulled it out my mouth and nailed it to a long stick .
va	4	A smile finally worked through when he told how furious his warriors were when he refused an alternate prize , a hundred pounds of fine steel .
va	3	Their conversation was innocuous , as though each was anxious to avoid any subject that might cause discomfort , and yet it had the spontaneity of friendship .
va	1	Her mind was already crackling with the implications of Neela 's discovery , and she resisted the distraction irritably , but finally she looked up .
va	4	An aura of power and strength seemed to shimmer around him , as fearsome -- yet as achingly temporal -- as the flames of the fire .
va	4	When he indicated no interest in how she 'd managed it , the disquieting thought that he already knew jarred her confidence , but she pressed ahead .
va	3	She 'd raised him to think of goals , to understand that men took what they wanted or settled for what was thrown to them .
va	3	By the time he thought to reach out , to substitute contact for speech , Col was gone , stalking to the Elders ' Bench .
va	1	Chapter 18 Within minutes of walking from Earth Heart to his own tent , Bay Yan collapsed , clutching the wound on his wrist and moaning .
va	0	It left a scar in the dirt and a flat , ugly sound that seemed to hang in the air long after it had bounced away .
va	0	He crawled on his belly past the suffused light coming through the tent wall , closing his mind against the throbbing of his wounded shoulder .
va	4	Chapter 20 The awe in Gan 's voice as he described Neela 's appearance in their midst brought a thin smile to his father 's face .
va	3	He gave the arm signal that all was well , but then followed it with another indicating they should continue to move dismounted , but faster .
va	3	Gan , squatting in front of him , literally felt the will of the man , the refusal to concede that his life was draining away .
va	3	He called to Leclerc and the Pastor , telling them to gather up anything that would burn and start a fire at the mouth of the cave .
va	4	In the middle of a detailed discussion of genetically altered diseases beginning to sweep away entire populations in days , shouts erupted in the background .
va	3	I figure the direction finders were a last ditch shot , that they 'd lost touch with everyone , that the whole works just came apart .
va	1	" Radioactivity , toxic chemical concentrations , unstable construction , predatory gangs -- " " And an ongoing breeding ground for more disease , " Conway added .
va	2	Joining in , thinking aloud , Conway added , " It 'd be like trying to construct a body from just a couple of bones .
va	4	There was another interesting facet to the way the group reacted , exemplified by the way they separated to go about their business of the morning .
va	1	In addition , I insist that you promise I shall be allowed to approach any humans we meet , that you won 't initiate hostilities . "
va	2	" Just so we 're all together , I 'm going to review your primary weapon for you , show you how to load and fire .
va	4	The entire weapon 's called a wipe , but when we speak of ' wiping , ' we 're speaking of firing the smaller barrel .
va	3	The slope was gentle for the most part , with only an occasional steep bench that forced them to pitch downward from tree trunk to tree trunk .
va	4	It made Conway think again that there was something about Leclerc that hinted this entire experience was less of a shock to him than anyone else .
va	0	This was Falconer 's idea ; it was supposed to keep animals at bay without illuminating their camp for any curious human eyes in the valley .
va	3	Carter wants to teach them that the working man is God Almighty and all they have to do is form a good union to prove it .
va	4	Although chagrined to see Conway come into the balance against her , she was very forbearing when she told him there were no hard feelings .
va	3	Without appearing to aim , he dropped both men with two shots so close together that the rolling , battering noise was almost a single explosion .
va	4	The reasons why a man lives and his enemy dies are very clear , so a man learns to respect only what he can see .
va	0	He still wasn 't comfortable with Cho , and as far as Shara was concerned , he 'd made it very clear he tolerated no youthful fools .
va	3	He 'd lost count of the times the adult pair moved off together in silent investigation , and the immature animal needed more rest than that .
va	1	Something that buzzed like an angry wasp struck a rock in front of Gan and spun to a stop on the gravel directly under his nose .
va	4	After assuring themselves that neither man was hurt , they sprayed questions at them about the strangers , hardly waiting for answers before asking more .
va	4	The geographical crest was usually ignored or avoided ; it provided a scenic outlook but silhouetted a figure for any eyes that cared to see .
va	4	Women like her had occasionally risen to Horse or Dog Chief , although they were never allowed in Earth Heart or men 's secret councils .
va	3	The quilted underwear didn 't show , of course , but he wished it did , the better to show the savage what good construction was .
va	0	My cavalry captain insists their leader killed a Mountain warrior at least five bow shots away , and he did it with thunder and lightning .
va	2	We don 't live our days tied to a plow or a fish net , like you who live on the rain side of the mountains .
va	4	Signing Tate to follow , he led the way back to the lean-to where he rummaged in his baggage until he located the bundle of twenty sticks .
va	3	Through the window under the front porch , Ted could see that Mr. Hoover was still sitting on the edge of his porch across the street .
va	3	He kept most of his dry foods in these and if the lids didn 't snap on tightly , humidity and insects quickly destroyed the contents .
va	3	Chapter Two A Visitor Ted crept up the stairs to the steel security door separating the basement family room from the rest of the house .
va	4	His hand went instinctively to the first deadbolt as he rose up on tiptoes to peer through the peephole in the center of the door .
va	4	On his way up to the kitchen , Ted bent over the coffee table and picked up his pistol , a .45 caliber Colt Gold Cup .
va	1	In any survival situation a sharp knife is probably your most essential accessory , but in Ted 's world pepper spray is probably number two .
va	4	The fact that they can generally remember where their home is , might prove that there is still more we need to learn about the human brain .
va	4	Ironically , as the contagion burned through the world like a wildfire , most people died in their homes without ever setting foot in a store again .
va	3	He didn 't know anything about her , other than the fact that she had him pinned to the floor and was threatening to slit his throat .
va	1	Killing a zombie child is always difficult psychologically , but it can be damn near impossible when the little ghoul is clutching a teddy bear .
va	0	Mounted to the cinder block wall , just under the water tank , was a narrow shelf with a soap dish and a bottle of baby shampoo .
va	3	A few minutes later , Ted heard the water stop splashing behind him , trailing off to a trickle and then just a steady dripping .
va	4	Ted wandered back over to the fireplace to poke at his fire and wonder about this marvelous and mysterious girl that had dropped into his life today .
va	3	He didn 't bother with the elastic strap , ( secretly hoping the hat would blow off and that would be the end of it ) .
va	3	I didn 't want to say anything at the time , but your eyes are the color of a zombie 's , " Melody said .
va	0	They might as well have been on the top of a mountain in Alaska or floating on a raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean .
va	1	You can 't imagine how many nights I 've spent alone in strange places , not knowing if I would even wake up in the morning .
va	3	Ted almost started to tell her about the nightmares and his usually fitful sleep , but he decided that it could wait for another time .
va	3	Down in the basement , Ted was still trying to calm down , but was starting to wonder if he hadn 't overreacted a bit himself .
va	3	" Today , of course , I would shoot the both of them at that point , but we had never seen anything like that before .
va	2	He was standing lookout on the roof this afternoon and swears he heard the noise of helicopter rotors from the north , maybe just beyond the hill .
va	3	" So , turning the conversation to the business at hand ; I don 't think this temporary privacy barrier is working out too well . "
va	3	Directly in front of her , at the near end of the lane , was a shooting bench with two stools in front of it .
va	4	Each time Ted heaved on the huge limb , the wood moved only a few pitiful inches forward , making a slow scraping sound on the pavement .
va	4	" I kept hoping that he 'd move a little to the right so only the wooden fence would be behind him , but it never happened .
va	4	So , I hauled some fuel over in a can , opened the doors , started the engine and drove right out of the building . "
va	2	If those weren 't good enough reasons ; shooting the zombie from this angle , he also would run the risk of spraying Melody with infectious material .
va	3	It took him longer to search this body , avoiding any contact with the copious amount of contagious brain goo that was splattered across its flight suit .
va	3	Ted tucked the ID card into his pocket and stowed his new toys in his pack before climbing into the Kubota and starting the engine .
va	2	It was easy to find reasons to postpone what was sure to be a long and arduous , trek while they were in such a comfortable position .
va	4	On the other hand , it never ceased to amaze Ted just how many things with true , intrinsic value could be found in the average bedroom .
va	4	She started feeding me some bullshit story about how they hadn 't been sure what I was and were concerned about the threat I posed .
va	2	" After Joe had put him at ease , the guy became very forthcoming , I think a little too forthcoming for his own good .
va	3	I had gotten pretty good at traveling cross-country and Joe and Lilith always stuck to the roads , at least when I was with them .
va	0	Flying along as fast as he dared , Ted scanned his environment constantly , examining any bit of cover that an attacker could use to ambush him .
va	1	" No , I don 't suppose he does , but I figure I 'm still safer with him than I would be on my own . "
va	1	" Listen , kid , I appreciate what you 're trying to do , but I 've been dealing with this for a long time .
va	3	" but I have no doubt that if he gets what he wants , he 'll kill us all without even thinking about it . "
va	3	Ted knew that the fate of the whole world , what little was left of it , would be affected by the transaction that happened tomorrow .
va	0	He flew higher than he had thought possible , but not too high , just barely catching the bottom rung of the ladder with his fingertips .
va	3	After all , it wasn 't every day that you found a boy sitting on a roof eating something that generated so many interesting crumbs !
va	0	It was a cheap and easy way to make a rifle suitable for hunting deer , a very popular pastime in the autumn woods in Pennsylvania . )
va	0	Ted was still unable to make out what was being said , but Lilith was waving her hands now and pointing her finger in Joe 's face .
va	3	Melody turned and ran about two blocks until she came across a house with a front porch that projected pretty far out into the sidewalk .
va	1	With its several ramps and sets of steps with steel railings , the loading docks became a sort of private skate park for the local slackers .
va	1	In one fluid motion , after kicking Jake away from him , Joe swiftly brought his boot heel down directly on Chris Yeager 's chin .
va	3	It was in this moment of suspended animation , that Ted came to another realization ; it occurred to him that he just might have underestimated Joe .
va	1	With his right hand , Joe grabbed a hank of Jake 's long greasy hair , winding it around his fingers for a good tight grip .
va	2	Some of these buildings had been converted to storage facilities and loft apartments years ago , but most stood abandoned with broken windows and rusting doors .
va	0	The sign read : " T.P. 's Salvage Yard " and underneath that , in small print : " Premises patrolled after hours by guard dogs . "
va	3	Ted reached the rear of a rusty old land yacht and leapt onto the trunk lid , running up the rear window and onto the roof .
va	0	Moving between the rows of cars as fast as he dared , Joe was on the alert for any sound that might betray an attack .
va	4	If he could get over the wall , he should be quite safe inside and at least he should be able to find some shade .
va	2	It was some small comfort that if he broke his legs when he hit the ground , he wouldn 't have to worry about dying of dehydration .
va	3	Despite the unsuccessful nature of the dogs ' attempts to get to him on top of the car , Ted realized it was time to move again .
va	3	He whistled to get the dogs ' attention and in an instant they were right below him again , jumping and biting at thin air .
va	2	At the far right side of the garage door opening and just inside the door , Ted could see a loop of chain hanging down .
va	3	He left them at the end of the wall farthest from , but still in sight of , the door on the side of the building .
va	4	Now he could take a break and he hopped down off the wall to explore a bit and make some preparations for the rest of his plan .
va	0	Another , a black shield , overlaid with the image of a raging Spanish fighting bull , had once graced the hood of a Lamborghini .
va	3	As soon as the zombie dogs spotted movement on top of the wall and caught Ted 's scent again , they went into full-blown attack mode .
va	1	Ted spun around and ran into the open door , turning quickly to the left and running down the aisle between the shelving and the wall .
va	2	He could hear their nails scrabbling on the smooth concrete floor as they slid around the corners and tried to gain forward momentum again to catch him .
va	3	He stumbled back to the shady side of the derelict school bus and collapsed against it , sliding down to a sitting position on the gravel lot .
va	4	Ted kept his head angled down towards the door 's locking mechanism , but his eyes were up and focused on the reflection in the plastic sign .
va	2	Joe had been pacing back and forth on the roof of the bus like a caged tiger , with the dogs following along below him .
va	0	For a split second , he had allowed his situational awareness to lapse and now the pain caused him to falter for just a moment .
va	0	As Joe 's grip around his throat tightened , Ted raised his arms and grasped Joe 's forearms in a futile attempt to pull them away .
va	1	Ted could hear a distant voice still yelling at him and he could vaguely see , in his peripheral vision , Joe going for his throat again .
va	2	Slowly , he collapsed , rolling off of the stack of pallets to land with a loud thump , face up in the gravel lot .
va	4	Ted and Melody wound their way through town on the way home , retracing their steps and retrieving gear they had discarded along the way .
va	2	Ted 's house literally stood out like a sore thumb in contrast to the neighbor 's places , all of which were slowly falling apart .
va	4	I would like to say that old habits die hard , but I just realized that I 've never driven on a real road before . "
va	4	" Jack 's Place " screams its existence to the world with insanely large , glowing , red stylized letters running parallel to the roof .
va	0	She has been this way since the passage through the portal sent her flying through the air ; after which she has no recollection of landing .
va	2	" Doctor , if you can hear this , we need your help , Warrior is ... unconscious , " the voice says with astonishment .
va	1	Lisa quickly decides she has a concussion at the very least , but judging by the wound , a cracked skull is a likely possibility as well .
va	4	She takes a deep breath and speaks toward the ceiling , " Warrior , we would like for you to take us to the Lunar Penal Colony .
va	0	" I wasn 't talking to you , " Valerie says , waving her hand in front of her as if to push warrior 's voice away .
va	1	" Warrior , my CU ... " " There is a subtle dampening field around the dock , which is effective in blocking your communications .
va	0	Lance twists his wrists so that his palms face away from each other then pulls his arms apart as if to part the way before him .
va	1	Lance squeezes his hand and Jason 's pistol , his favorite and a gift from Aria , is crushed , the electronic sight sparks and dies .
va	1	Layers of pain replace the horror of being sucked out into space ; his skin is alight with exquisite fire that equals in strength to his fury .
va	4	I still come here often , it 's been a long time since I brought you here , " Aria observes , her smooth voice distant .
va	3	A corpse , dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit , is strapped in the chair at the left control station , its flesh is burnt and smoking .
va	1	" Jason , Astral House is my projection , unless I am there with you , the place doesn 't exist , " Aria says .
va	0	Jason , sweetheart , Doctor Dresden has assessed your condition and it ... there is no natural way to save you , " Aria announces bluntly .
va	0	Warrior needs our help and we are just ... " " I am aware of the situation , Doctor , " Aria snaps cutting Lisa off .
va	3	It won 't help our captain and it won 't help us to determine what is hunting us , " Aria says as she straightens herself .
va	4	" Commander , we are proceeding with the first stage ... are you certain about theses ... changes ... I wonder if Captain Drake would approve . "
va	2	Lance looks up at the girl with disgust , although the condition of his face , skull like , he could be smiling for anyone could tell .
va	0	We may have evolved away from humanity in a distinct way , but we are also very much the same in many other ways . "
va	1	A single continent is visible floating in a purple ocean and bright flashes of light can be seen all over it along with rising gray clouds .
va	1	There is a buzzing noise and suddenly , with no explanation , she finds herself standing on what would appear to be a ruined world .
va	0	" Thank you Warrior , but we lost many officers on Neo Utopia , my advancement was out of necessity , " Valarie states humbly .
va	3	I thought you said ... " " It wasn 't mine and it wasn 't yours either , " Jason replies getting off the stool .
va	2	Doctor Dresden looks over at the floating biosynthetic doctor and says , " well , she is very stubborn about this , I apologize , Doctor . "
va	2	Speaking of lying , you lied when you told me you didn 't speak to your father , but you did , didn 't you ? "
va	0	Again Jason turns and fires instinctively , a plume of blood , skull and brain flashing onto the dock doorframe as a soldier crumples to the gangway .
va	4	Grabbing a cold metal support beam , he swings himself up , performs a somersault and lands on his feet on the metal deck of the gangway .
va	4	Such lovely flesh and what beautiful eyes you have , " Lance gurgles then starts to giggle ; a deeply insane giggle mixed with hatred and pain .
va	0	Gathering his will , his heart filled with hatred and pain , Lance draws power down his arms as a bright red nimbus glows around his hands .
va	4	Neo Utopia was supposed to be the end of them , yet she still flies and Drake not only lives , he looks amazing . "
va	2	He looks at Lisa , " Doctor Everett , thank you for your help , I never got a chance to praise your work before .
va	0	Both dragons tumble end over end in a mess of arms , claws , tails and snapping teeth in a cloud of dust along the rocky surface .
va	3	Skillfully , Warrior gets to her feet first , turns and races at Lance who has not quite figured out standing , let alone walking .
va	1	" Besides , it sounds like my other project is nearing completion and if it is as promising as it sounds , we will be unstoppable . "
va	0	Upon stuffing herself , Maya lies back on her father 's couch and groans with satisfaction while resting both of her hands on her very full stomach .
va	3	A transparent docking tube extends out from the flat wall opposite the great iris door and attaches itself to the hatch in warrior 's chest .
va	0	" Doctor Everett , we cannot second guess what has already happened and nobody knew what Lance was until it was too late , " Warrior states .
va	1	Its internal power must be very unstable and those guns are ridiculous , I don 't care how scary it looks , " Lisa states .
va	2	" Lisa , study these images some more and pinpoint some other weak spots for Warrior and our weapons officers to concentrate on , " Jason suggests .
va	0	" Wait , Aria , is there anyway for you to tap into Warrior to increase your will and defend the ship or fight Lance ? "
va	1	Taking a quick looking around and seeing no one , she throws her arms about the burly man 's neck and hungrily presses her lips against his .
va	4	Beverly , moaning with pleasure , stretches out her hand to slap the door pad , which instantly reads her DNA signature and releases the door locks .
va	3	" I know they have you chasing pirates through the Ort Cloud , but you better hang close to the closest static jump portal . "
va	2	" Have fun and try not work him to hard , he looks a little soft for you , " Jason says with a wink .
va	3	" I know how you feel about humans , but the treaty ... " " Oh please , can we just not do the political thing .
va	2	" Oh that 's right , you put your disgusting seed in one of our women and somehow that makes you part of our community .
va	3	It is only your plan that keeps me here now , but don 't think that you control me or you will regret it . "
va	4	Maya 's eyes are closed , and a beam of red laser light is blazing against her forehead where her open third eye has again appeared .
va	0	He snaps his head up to look at the catwalk far above and makes a joyful hoot sound before flapping his wings and soaring upward swiftly .
va	2	I promise you , when this is over , we will target our resources to getting you into that body of yours , " Jason assures .
va	4	Her heart is filled with pure joy as finally her wish comes true and the man of her dreams has finally found his way to her .
va	4	Lance draws back his clawed hand and prepares to jam it into the tiny cage when suddenly he looks up , his massive eyes blinking .
va	1	His pants are barely hanging from his hips from all the rips in it , much of his legs are exposed , displaying deep cuts and gashes .
va	4	We were told that he died in an accident , but somebody else , who was there , told us that Prince Lance killed him .
va	2	Looking down , Jason watches the iris entrance to Dock Four open and a sleek looking vessel with a dark blue metallic hull slowly backing out .
va	1	It is one thing for he alone to jump into the breach , but a far heavier thing to bring so many lives with him .
va	0	She steps away , salutes her Captain and clearly states , " Captain Drake , Commander , BFS Javelin , requesting permission to depart , sir . "
va	0	" You know , dear , commanding more than one ship makes you an Admiral , " Aria suggests while playfully nibbling the back of his neck .
va	3	I am mustering the fleet , fly into formation when you get here and get ready to jump to Earth orbit , " Jason states emphatically .
va	3	" Your attention please , this is your commanding officer , this is our first time out together and unfortunately we are going straight into battle .
va	0	I am sure you are all aware of our chances , but I have every confidence in both Captain Drake and all of you in particular .
va	0	" She can 't hear you child , at least not that way , " Warrior says , her voice coming from all around her .
va	1	Captain Tate 's once long straight nose is broken in three places , blood pours from his nostrils and his eyes look glassy and distant .
va	4	A stream of red energy blasts from his fingertips cutting a clean hole through the white uniformed man , who crumples back to the deck , lifeless .
va	1	She leans down to whisper in Lisa 's ear , " I 'm just kidding , nobody on this filthy ship is going to live . "
va	2	" It doesn 't matter how big and powerful your guns are , a whole army of you Neanderthals couldn 't touch me , " Gwendolyn boasts .
va	0	Aria snaps her arms down , her hands glowing with a green nimbus as she pulls a magical shield around her , blocking the attack .
va	4	She spins the handle of her blade back into her hand and holds it in her clenched fist , the point aimed at the deck .
va	0	Breach alarms start to sound , but many are unable to deal with anything as Dagger continues his passage through bulkheads and ripping compartments open to space .
va	2	" Your daughter was connected to me for a long time , seems your " Channel " is open to me now too , " Warrior states .
va	0	Dagger slows to a stop and watches in awe , as both fighting dragons become a burning streak of light descending toward the planet 's surface .
va	4	Dagger swoops about and flies back toward the battlefield where the last volley of what history will call " The Battle of Earth " is being fired .
va	2	The CIC crew jumps to work , calling to each other and speaking over their CU 's in an effort to effect manual control of Warrior .
va	4	Warrior leaps skyward , extends her claws and delivers a combination of Particle Beam and Pulse Cannon fire into the discolored region near his rear legs .
va	0	The transports had been waiting for a signal to jump to Earth and begin an assault on her cities , but the signal , thankfully never came .
va	4	Maya moves up next to Doctor Dresden and slips her hand into his free hand , which hangs at his side , wrinkled with age .
va	4	Most of the stories about these phenomena are normally referred to at dreary museums or read about in musty old texts books for they happened long ago .
va	4	They might want to become celebrities just like myself and probably you as well so , we can get our ideas out and entertain our peers .
va	1	It lingered in their brains , releasing small images of their son and their daughter in law in court wearing suits and dividing their belongings .
va	4	Together they bought their own house , raised their only son to be an honorable businessman and were now retired , completely free of financial troubles .
va	3	They got into their truck and drove off on the lively streets of Victoria eventually making it to the highway that takes them home to Nanaimo .
va	4	He couldn 't see anything so , he grabbed his flashlight and began to step out of the truck when his uncle grabbed his arm .
va	3	The furious truck driver loaded the gun and hopped out of his truck just in time to be standing right in front of the pack of wolves .
va	2	I have got to warn you , the guide is a bit of a nut but , he 's a good friend of mine . "
va	3	The sea taxi finally pulled up to the dock attached to the island and the group took their first steps out on New Castle Island .
va	0	John walked with his shoulders hunched towards one of the only buildings on the island , which was merely a bit larger than a house .
va	2	After strolling through a hall with wooden walls on one side and bathrooms on the other , visitors reach a comfortable room attached to the restaurant .
va	0	At one point it looked as if the woman was taking a picture of him but , she was actually focused on the headboard above him .
va	3	John and Jimmy both thought it was very strange she was taking pictures of everything but nature ; however , they didn 't say a word .
va	4	Timothy , hopped carelessly rock to rock keeping record of every creature that was socializing in the pools until his feet sank into the gravely shore .
va	4	Everyone was very enthusiastic about the photo knowing how much the boy wanted to see a sea lion , but John felt obligated to break the news .
va	0	A second later , a spray of water blew into the air as the ocean waves were slapped by the black fin of an orca whale .
va	4	Slapping their thick tales against the water , each pair continued to move forward without letting the orca encased deer 's heads go under water .
va	0	He told many fishermen 's tales during the next hour about fishing with his majestic boat " The Robin " which sported a red hull .
va	0	Unfortunately , that dream like most sport dreams didn 't work out as planned and now he drives the sea taxi back and forth every day .
va	4	She contently whipped out her phone which was exactly identical to his and began playing a very loud game to be sure to catch his attention .
va	0	John staggered back a bit , then after a long glance at the cold floor he said , " It will be us against the island . "
va	3	Once Ben was free , without showing the slightest bit of gratitude , he rushed out the door into the restaurant crazily muttering more obscenities to himself .
va	1	Jimmy , who was carrying Timothy , had so much adrenaline driven by fear he was bounding over the huge debris with his frail , skinny legs .
va	4	John braced himself , gripping the branch he had pinned himself to and once again closed his eyes to hide from the terrifying image forming before him .
va	4	The stoic sea lions remained in this outrageously chilling state for what seemed to be an eternity when suddenly , they all rushed the cliff in unison .
va	3	After hauling himself up , they both stood awkwardly on the rafters listening intently to the strident creaking noise that was rattling the whole building .
va	1	The thought struck Thomas 's pessimistic mind like poisoned arrow , spreading negativity throughout his thinking process making it unbearable to figure out a way to live .
va	4	Two orca whales had just entered the building , their dorsal fins protruded out of the four meter high water projecting heckling cackles at the humans .
va	3	Spotting a peculiar object in the distance , Timothy tried to point and yell but , the roar of the wind was muffling his high pitched voice .
va	1	The cane swooped down again , this time knocking a particularly straggly wolf right in the knee caps bringing it skidding into the hard gravelly ground .
va	1	John had no time to turn his head back around when he felt two padded feet push against back knocking him down to the ground .
va	2	John and Jimmy 's deer had started heading the same direction and had their heads bowed down ready to prong any wolf that dared touch the boy .
va	4	They all began to see the rarely viewed under side of the massive ferry and the craters that had been punctured into it from impact .
va	0	A diamond ring shaped with clusters of other diamonds to make a master diamond was sitting in his hand like a pearl inside a clam .
va	3	Another addition to the story , many of the cars that had fallen off the out of control ferry are going to stay where they are .
va	4	I know where the café is -- I 've been here before -- and I don 't want to hold you up any longer . "
va	1	Inhaling deeply so she wouldn 't choke on the words , Claire said softly , " Sorry Mum , I must have misheard Ruth 's instructions .
va	3	Trying to tell her the truth when she thinks she knows what 's what is like trying to find clothes in your size in the sale .
va	2	Arriving reeking of alcohol when I 'm about to be put in charge of a six-year-old for two weeks is probably not a great idea .
va	4	Blood rushed to Claire 's face but any chagrin at her niece 's repeated words vanished when she caught sight of her mother 's face .
va	3	It 's going to be like working with Carl again , but it will be worth it to find out what they really think of me .
va	1	Did she think we were only going to do little girl things , or did she hope rich Claire would take poor little Sky shopping ?
va	4	Wind whistled along King 's Parade and it was cold in the shade , despite the sun peeking over the buildings in front of them .
va	3	To stretch out these last moments with Josh and his family , knowing they would be flying half way round the world in a few days .
va	0	She flicked a glance at Fiona , but the woman was discretely distant , marshalling a game of hide and seek amidst the empty market stalls .
va	0	A crumpled magazine lay discarded on the floor and she stared at Claire , arms folded , bottom lip jutting out like a bad collagen injection .
va	4	Rolling back over , she felt on the bedside table for the in-ear thermometer the woman in the room next door had lent her for the night .
va	4	She rubbed sleep from her eyes and swung her feet out of bed , glad sharing with Sky had ensured she 'd worn her pyjamas .
va	3	The fairy godmother talked to the other frog and found out it didn 't want to be a prince , it liked being a frog .
va	0	Little girl said the fairy godmother , if you wave this wand and turn me back into a fairy I will help you escape the angry bears .
va	0	I 've been looking online -- apparently there 's a miniature railway that runs from here to a place called Walsingham -- " " Walsingham ?
va	3	When I think how lonely I was when I first started this journey , and now I can 't wait to be alone with my own thoughts .
va	3	Crouching down next to her niece , she tried to frame words in her head that might entice her back to the car without a tantrum .
va	3	Their own parents had been so distant and uncaring , it seemed highly plausible that Ruth wouldn 't want to let Sky out of her sight .
va	0	She watched as all the blood drained from Chris 's face , much as it had from Sky 's earlier , and felt a certain satisfaction .
va	0	The sound cut through the low hubbub of the crowd and a rippling revealed Chris 's location as he made his way through the press of bodies .
va	3	Another rifle through the bag produced a tub of powder , but for all Claire knew it was teething crystals or talc for the baby 's bottom .
va	1	She could feel people staring as she pushed the wailing child through tunnels , past tanks of turtles and sharks , and out towards the penguins .
va	4	Angry feelings squirmed in her stomach and she felt regret swarming up inside her , accusing her of causing Sky more pain by inviting Chris here .
va	0	Also by Amanda Martin : BABY BLUES AND WEDDING SHOES Amanda 's latest release , the chick lit novel Baby Blues and Wedding Shoes is available now .
va	1	Readers with an appreciation for a bit of reality and a bit of hopeful romantic wishful dreaming will not be disappointed by this lovely tale .
va	4	His abrupt movement caused the horse to dance a little , and the prince reined him in sharply , taking his anger out on his mount .
va	3	Chapter 1 The sunlight streamed in through the stained glass windows lining the upper right-hand wall , turning the dust motes a kaleidoscope of colors .
va	3	To the right of the throne stood a serving man , holding a tray with cool water and glasses for the men on the dais .
va	1	Finally , the serving man was lying in front of the dais with three apparently poisonous darts in his body , having successfully protected his king .
va	0	Other than his height , he was totally nondescript when he was standing still , with his short cropped , sandy blond hair and brilliant blue eyes .
va	3	It seems that there is a serious attempt underway for the throne of this kingdom , and we both know that this jeopardizes both of our realms .
va	1	Your training makes you a highly skilled assassin , and assassins make the best bodyguards because they know all of the tricks of the trade .
va	4	These were the weapons she was most familiar with , and most comfortable with , though she had training to use a number of others .
va	4	She wrapped her weapons carefully , and laid them into the bottom of one of the trunks Marja was apparently expecting her to fill with her belongings .
va	4	" I guess that these will have to do , " she sighed , turning around and surveying the piles of fabric scattered around the room .
va	2	" We should dunk you in the river , clean you all up , and tie a ribbon around your neck for good measure . "
va	3	Marja reached into a small box that was sitting on the seat beside her and started sorting through accessories , looking for something that matched the dress .
va	3	Rupert always found it difficult to stay in shape , to find time to practice , and I can use the daily check to my ego . "
va	0	The handlers were another story , reacting as if a wild animal had wandered into the castle and was about to lay waste to the place .
va	4	You should hurry though , because I have the seamstress coming soon and dinner will likely be served not long after you 're done with her . "
va	0	Byron smiled back , happy that she wasn 't badly injured and that she apparently wasn 't going to hold a grudge about being beaten .
va	4	" So tell me about this Alexius girl everyone seems to want you to marry , " she asked , getting them moving once again .
va	0	She pushed her blades up and apart , throwing Byron 's blade out to the side and following through with a thrust of her dagger .
va	4	" Yes , but I got the audience and you 're the only one who got to see me knocked flat on my back -- twice . "
va	3	It looked like it would be a small gathering for breakfast this morning , Collin indicating to the servants that they could bring in the food .
va	0	He would be wearing black pants also , but his shirt was a beige silk , meant to set off his black hair and bright eyes .
va	4	People had been seeing her around court and city these past few days , but nobody had ever inquired about her identity within her hearing .
va	3	It was rather fun to watch the ladies absorb the information , realizing that she was that extra step above them , royalty as opposed to nobility .
va	3	She actually felt a bit sorry for them , understanding how nervous it must make them , thinking that they had to compete against her .
va	0	Natasha sighed as she packed her husband 's belongings , making sure to pack something particularly formal for his arrival , and something black for the funeral .
va	3	The four guards were left standing by the doorway , knowing what they had heard but having no idea what to do with the information .
va	4	Your kingdom gave us that help mostly because while our emissary was here trying to forge an agreement , she saved your king from an assassination attempt .
va	4	" My father didn 't trust you , and he told me about you the very night that you arrived here , " Branden answered .
va	0	You could take up a dagger and try to plunge it into my heart and I would be unable to strike back against you . "
va	2	It was bad enough that there was a formal coronation ceremony looming on tomorrow 's horizon ; he didn 't really need the rooms today .
va	4	He looked at her face , at her bright eyes and the stubborn set of her mouth , and he knew that she was deadly serious .
va	3	He suddenly wished that he 'd paid closer attention to what his father had been doing , but then he brushed that thought away as unproductive .
va	4	" If it wasn 't for the pact between our kingdoms , then his Majesty 's command to leave would have sent you fleeing from this castle .
va	4	She had already explored the cathedral , noting the main door and the smaller back door hidden behind one of the tapestries flanking the altar .
va	4	There were three massive columns running along each wall , and between them were immense stained glass windows , each depicting a different facet of the gods .
va	1	As soon as he was positioned to her liking , she threw the first of her knives , leaping down toward the assassin a split-second later .
va	2	" Ah , but you have also lost one of your own , don 't forget , and we have completed part of our contract .
va	4	As the assassin fell forward , nearly doubled over in pain , she stepped behind him , and with a brutal twist , snapped his neck .
va	4	When that pair failed , they sent more guild members , which would explain the delay between those initial attacks and the one on your father yesterday .
va	0	I 'm curious about what happened yesterday while I slept , and I want to ask your opinion of a few things , that 's all . "
va	1	After her visit with Byron , she had returned to her room to get dressed properly , and Marja had shown her the injuries in a mirror .
va	4	" Your Majesty , " she began , " the princess asked me to express her deepest apologies that she is not able to attend personally .
va	4	I know that you 're officially here to be his bodyguard , but still , everyone thinks you 're here as a potential bride . "
va	2	I will give you more salve , which you should apply tonight and again in the morning , to both your ribs and your face .
va	1	The décor struck her as very similar to her brother 's rooms back home , full of heavy , functional furniture , and bold colors .
va	2	In the meantime , I 'm going for a ride , but you 're more than welcome to join us if you want to . "
va	3	All three of them were happy just to be out of the castle for at least a little while , with nothing to worry about .
va	3	The sun was beginning to set , and they both knew that it was more than time for them to head back to the castle .
va	3	We do have guards stationed at his father 's home , and pairs of guards patrolling the city , but nobody 's reported anything yet .
va	4	Mateo is considerably quieter than Marcus is , so if you get very short , succinct responses to questions , you 're likely dealing with Mateo .
va	4	" I don 't care about whether she 's available or not , " drawled an angry voice , " I will see her now ! "
va	4	Blood began to flow , making her grip less than certain , and she stepped back quickly , trying to buy herself a little bit of time .
va	3	This wasn 't the best position to be in , not by a long shot , but it was all that she had for the time being .
va	0	But she also felt her own sword hit home , catching the assassin on the hip , turning him and distracting him from his shot .
va	4	The dagger flew wide , embedding itself into the doorframe , and the assassin looked down at her , sprawled and bleeding on the floor .
va	2	" There is obviously something , and I 'll find out one way or another , so you might as well tell me yourself . "
va	2	You , my young king , have a lot to do , and you can 't do it while you 're pining away in here .
va	4	She knew what this sentence would mean ; she would live her life alone except for servants , guards and whichever family members would risk visiting her .
va	3	Even though they had not been at this for very long , it didn 't take long for his older joints and muscles to stiffen .
va	3	They didn 't have to know the truth of the matter ; they would find that out later if it was deemed necessary that they know .
va	0	" What about if we settle for teaching you how to keep out of harm 's way , and perhaps aide from a distance ? "
va	4	That means that all of the thoughts and feelings he had were simply magnified by the effects of the medication , not created by them .
va	3	" I don 't know when things got out of control , but the more time you spent with her , the angrier I got .
va	1	I understand if you don 't want me to be your advisor anymore , and I will understand if you banish me along with my sister .
va	0	There was an archery target set up against the far wall and a pair of heavy wooden swords waiting in the center of the courtyard .
va	4	He looked a lot better today , not nearly so green , and his blue eyes held a sparkle that had been missing these past days .
va	3	" I know that I 'm to blame for the way things ended , and I 'm going to make sure that it doesn 't happen again .
va	4	You would be an asset to me , as my advisor , and it would give you a reason to be with me all the time .
va	3	She could also feel his conviction that this was the right thing to do , his belief that this would be perfect , for both of them .
va	4	She could feel a presence in the room , and she turned her head to see her father sitting in a chair beside the bed .
va	4	" I really enjoy the time I spend with him , at least now , and I think that we are becoming very good friends .
va	1	" If you don 't say it out loud , " he said softly , " it makes it less real , less ... painful .
va	3	I 'm not sure what it is about you , but you have certainly changed him , and I think it 's for the better .
va	2	" I didn 't ask you if you wanted to chop wood , " Byron stated sternly , " I told you to do it .
va	3	" I think that it would be interesting to see another city , " he said , " and I would like to learn new things .
va	3	" We were fortunate that Grandfather managed to convince anyone with the proper connections to marry him , given the fact that he was a bastard . "
va	3	Knowing that the screaming would certainly attract attention , Durham stepped past the man as he dropped to the ground , and engaged the other guard .
va	0	" The guards are on their way , and we all have death warrants hanging over our heads , so we should go very quickly . "
va	4	Durham , ignoring the warning , just dodged to the left and kept on running , heading for the wall he could see ahead of him .
va	3	Desperate to get away , Durham began to crawl toward the wall , now lost to view behind the plants growing in front of him .
va	4	Branden stretched , feeling content and happy to be a part of the group again , even if his role was now a minor one .
va	4	She rolled over carefully and saw the tray sitting on the bedside table , so she sat up and decided to investigate what was under the lid .
va	0	The healer said that I could start stretching and exercising again in about a week , which is great news as far as I 'm concerned .
va	2	If you don 't want to come here , you don 't have to , but nobody else is going to be coming here either . "
va	0	He had left a pathway , and it was up this path that he walked , leaving his guards at the base of the stairs .
va	4	They walked up the aisle , steps in perfect time with each other , each man taking his position at a corner of the bier .
va	1	The ring was unusual in it was a red ruby carved into an elegant rose , mounted on a solid gold ring of thorny branches .
va	0	His wife had joined him on board the ship as a cabin maid and had seen no luxuries that a first mate 's salary could typically provide .
va	3	More than twenty-five men joined the first mate in his plan to overtake Charles II and they only had to wait for an opportunity to present itself .
va	4	" He growled over the breeze that blew subtly past his face blowing his scarf behind him , trailing out like the tail of a kite .
va	0	Captain Every had once possessed boyish good looks , but his days as a pirate had long since vanished any claims to beauty he might have had .
va	4	Having a man like Every around her constantly , made certain that she never had to encounter anything that would mar her loveliness or her mood .
va	4	She passed the table that Avery had joined to gamble his most recent bounty and proceeded to the stairs to a room they had rented .
va	4	He grabbed her after his victory and guided her to the bar where he bought her , himself and the first mate all a drink on him .
va	4	It was a meat and vegetable stew poured over rice and they all three dug into the meal with velocity unmatched by any other patrons .
va	4	He unseated Scarborough from his lap and gently set her on the bench beside him , so he could go talk business among the men .
va	2	" Yes Mam , I will see you around I hope soon , " he pointed to Scarborough but she gave him no indication of a reply .
va	4	There were also things like roots and flowers hanging to dry from the shelf itself and a few pieces of various hides of different animals .
va	4	Avery 's head shot up at the cry of the raunchy sailors and he quickly called , " Scarborough , my dear , come over here ! "
va	3	It was cool to the touch now , but still slightly moist , and she laid it out on the bedside table to examine it .
va	2	She spent the rest of the night and a good portion of the early morning hours changing back and forth from her new form to her old .
va	3	" I hope then it will satisfy you more than it has my wife , she can 't get her hands off of it ! "
va	4	He took in a large breath and stared deeply into Scarborough 's eyes , which sparked gold due to the sunlight cast through the window .
va	3	Scarborough quickly shot him a glance that informed him the matter was still serious , so he stopped his outburst and returned to his previous state .
va	4	queried Scarlett , not having any clue as to the real customs of the African people , " how many people do we need here ? "
va	0	She shrieked upon the arrival of what she thought of as a friendly savior but what appeared in front of her as a gigantic spider .
va	4	Scarlett turned and looked down at herself , she looked at her legs and was horrified to discover that they were now long spindly and black .
va	0	Attached at every angle , was a beautiful intricate spider web and on it sat a beautiful tiny black spider with a large red hourglass .
va	2	Every removed the hourglass from its attachment to the web , destroying her hours of work in only a second , sending Scarborough tumbling to the ground .
va	0	" Alas , I have finally arranged an exchange for two other pieces of the map , Thanks in part to your wedding treasure Scarborough . "
va	0	If my head faced the sky it meant clear skies ahead and to hoist the flag , which now proudly was dedicated to my hourglass .
va	3	He used the skin to stretch and dry and make a roll of parchment for Scarborough to enter into a Part with the Devil on .
va	4	The two outside prongs were smooth and pointed with an opal in each end and ceased by blending smoothly in to the hips of the fiddles body .
va	3	On the bottom of the musical apparatus there was nothing but the gold prongs which must have meant it got rather uncomfortable after long playing .
va	2	" Yes , " said Lou , " They do now , but not always , would you like me to tell you the story ? "
va	1	Thundering and storming Noah and his family settled in with all the animals on the Ark , all the animals but one , the unicorn .
va	2	" Not to stop you two , " proposed Scarborough , " But how about you play us another song on that fiddle of yours ? "
va	1	Each providing her with an infinitesimal amount of blood she used her front tarsus claws to absorb ink and then scrawled tiny spider writing across the manuscript .
va	4	The freshly tilled soil was easy to work and they were done before the sun rose , which was good for the suspicion of the town folk .
va	0	" Aye , " replied Avery , " That , and my soul is as condemned as yours was , whatever that may mean . "
va	4	There was a distinguishable marking or figure on the spider 's head that looked identical to the fiddle shaped object he had stolen from the Devil .
va	4	" Typical chestnut mare , " thought Scarborough , as she examined the horse 's gaits , three easy liquid measures burning themselves into her gaze .
va	1	Handing me a dark woolen cloak I draped myself in it and tied it off at the neck thinking about how I just might have saved mine .
va	4	Such nice care they were giving her , this man must really appreciate his horses , or maybe just the ones that are particularly fast .
va	2	I looked down at his stall and almost laughed out loud when I realized his name , it was so simple , so obvious , of course .
va	2	So much so I just grunted and ignored most of them with small , one word answers , until he came to this line of questioning .
va	2	" Race starts tomorrow at sundown , its twenty five miles , no water , and so pack for yourself and your poor , suffering animal .
va	3	That was the first time she got friction being a female rider and a non-native in this strange land , but it wouldn 't be the last .
va	0	She had feed him hours ago not wanting to upset his stomach with a heavy hay belly and cause colic in the hot summer heat .
va	4	" Perhaps I will see you at the finish line , " he replied , " Or perhaps I won 't , hopefully I do though . "
va	2	Soon enough they brought over a garland of jasmine flowers and placed it around Go 's neck , which he promptly took a bite out of .
va	0	The cave we were entering was called Blind Man 's Bluff and was very dark but also filled with a noxious gas that was highly flammable .
va	3	As I pulled out my map I studied the short cut when suddenly a great gust of wind came and blew it straight out of my hand .
va	4	This was how Scarborough closed the letter she had written to the dignified Edward Coke , pleading with him to save her from her predicament .
va	0	But in this case , it hopefully would work to her favor , now that the once boy was a man almost the same age as she .
va	3	The Sultan begged one last time not to be parted with his fast little devil of a horse , but nothing was changing Scarborough 's mind .
va	2	Insulting the Sultan was rare indeed and once he was out of sight and earshot , Scarborough and Coke broke out into fits of laughter .
va	2	Hopefully , the undefeated Godolphin Arabian Kingston would lose to the newest haunt in town , Arabia 's scariest phantom of a horse , Ghost Op .
va	0	He was overwhelmed at his luck that God had heard his prayers and was giving him the opportunity to find a new pathway to his original form .
va	4	" My name is Scarborough Black , " and as she held out one hand to shake she pulled out a pipe with the other .
va	1	" Far from it , " Scarborough chuckled , " It 's typically defined in the dictionary as a word meaning you 'll take anything seriously .
va	4	That 's when Avery turned and left the stage , only to be informed that everyone was still wondering who played the last round of the contest .
va	4	Blushing red with both anger and vengeance on his mind , he screamed out for the farmer playing his fiddle but he was nowhere to be found .
va	0	Once he finally was assured that no one was going to harm him by Avery , the man finally was willing to talk about the fiddle .
va	3	What was to be a revelation to the world over spirituality and the philosophy of wisdom , could always be a destiny better suited to another .
va	3	When she pictured time it slithered by smoothly counting seconds on the clock making its effort to strike the hour it rang in so diligently .
va	4	She often mused these words herself , realizing mankind 's new understanding of times place in everyone 's lives was what we really needed to know .
va	4	After collecting several different types in order to preserve the species , the message could be then passed forward throughout the millennia and prophecy could occur .
va	1	Even if it takes millions of light-years to reach its destination , it may eventually go back in time billions of years previous to its origination .
va	4	Kim was snuggled next to Jeff , curled into his shoulder in such a pose of belonging it made Claire 's heart contract like withered fruit .
va	0	She thought about trying to have that conversation with her mother , and whether she would choose to raise children the way she was raised .
va	3	Both looked serious but Claire knew that was Robert 's habitual expression , and tried not to let it twist the knot ever tighter in her tummy .
va	2	" Sky , poppet , would you like to play that word game I downloaded for you , so your Mummy can have a rest ? "
va	4	Claire realised the idiocy of her words as she watched Ruth 's face lose any hint of ashen pallor and turn a dangerous hue of red .
va	4	He would either deflect the question back to Claire and her perpetually single and childless state , or he would frown and change the subject completely .
va	3	It 's got no warmth , but she 's so afraid of it turning into her Mother 's house , full of tat and mess and pictures .
va	4	Even though she had stayed with Sky at her house for the week , now Ruth was home it felt impolite simply to walk in .
va	4	Claire gave her another hug , then turned to where Sky was snuggled up with Nana in the armchair , her face wet and blotchy .
va	0	Pulling the thin arms away from her neck as gently as she could , Claire took Sky 's hand and led her back to sit with Nana .
va	1	Her visitor numbers had suffered , during her fortnight minding Sky , although she had maintained the regular posts by discussing trips out with children .
va	3	With a shiver , Claire took a couple of photos , then turned and went back through the restaurant to wander in the sculpture garden .
va	4	Despite studying The Arts at university , sculpture wasn 't really her thing , so she was surprised at how peaceful the garden had seemed .
va	2	No more cooking , no more sitting like a lemon in a tiny lounge , trying not to feel like the girl that time forgot .
va	3	She let the teenagers past , and took up position at the rear again -- this time to watch for stragglers rather than to mope .
va	3	She 'd only come to visit the Tourist Information Centre , hoping to find exciting things to do in the area before Julia got there first .
va	0	A knot twisted Claire 's stomach as , at last , the satnav ran out of roundabouts and led her off the dual carriage way .
va	3	The dome dominated the skyline in front of her as if it was a true mountain rather than a monstrosity of steel filled with fake snow .
va	4	The words were barely formed in her mind before she lost her balance and landed heavily in the snow , her arm trapped awkwardly beneath her .
va	0	Also by Amanda Martin : BABY BLUES AND WEDDING SHOES Amanda 's latest release , the chick lit novel Baby Blues and Wedding Shoes is available now .
va	1	Readers with an appreciation for a bit of reality and a bit of hopeful romantic wishful dreaming will not be disappointed by this lovely tale .
va	1	How could she possibly find the book when at the first place she was not sure if she was the right person to handle such responsibility ?
va	4	Her vision became blurry and the last things she saw was the picture of her protecting one of them while the other fell into great darkness .
va	2	The young woman draw out a flagon from one of the horse 's back and went to the stream to fetch some water for a drink .
va	1	Not a minute she think that she will end up in a world like this -- a world which only exists in a human 's imagination .
va	0	" Enjoy your meal , " the woman said , curling the tips of her hair and took a glance at Chase before turning to Sofia .
va	4	Iris utters a spell and the wooden chairs along with the tables flew directly over the woman but it had been blocked with an invisible shield .
va	2	Looking down , sharp rocks debris that was formed of rock corrosion awaits on its bottom , with tall pine trees the showers its cones .
va	3	The moment it touches the ground , it turned into a beautiful woman with pointy ears and dazzling red hair that extends down to its feet .
va	4	Sofia tried to get hold of the book but her arms were caught by the one-eyed monster , lifting her and pitched her out of the chamber .
va	4	Few steps and she will be roasted on the burning flame beneath just like the dirt that had fell from the ground where she was standing .
va	3	I left as soon as the first snow of winter had fallen , I never thought that I would return on the first bloom of spring . "
va	4	To my readers : I 'm truly grateful that you 've chosen to give this series a read , please take your time and enjoy the journey .
va	4	The dreams still haunted him as they always had , veiled whispers that tugged at the back corners of his mind -- promises , revelations ... threats .
va	1	Seven turned on that voice to find his sister staring at him -- her wide green eyes shining with a child-like innocence that thinly , so thinly !
va	3	Perhaps they should have simply remained quiet , waiting for a conclusion dictated by fate and set into motion upon the first breath of the first star .
va	0	Alex 's voice came in an angry and desperate roar , a challenge directed at a world that would not listen , would not answer .
va	4	" We 're surrounded , " whispered the figure , her lilting voice clear and fierce , though Alex had to lean in to hear .
va	4	Mirai stared at him with eyes like liquid flame , golden in the hazy sunset , " With their false gods now , " she replied .
va	4	" Normally I would leave you here , " she declared , " but it looks like I owe you a quick favor for the trouble .
va	1	Raising his head just enough to catch a glance , a group of angry looking militia with thick beards and dirty clothes were gesturing in their direction .
va	4	And then , as suddenly as she appeared , she was gone -- faded into the very fabric of the unforgiving universe , ever pursuing her prey .
va	3	Instead , she concentrated on getting the candy bar into her mouth -- and , that mission accomplished , took time to take stock of her surroundings .
va	4	That sparked the kids ' attention , and they looked to their princess expectantly , hoping she would negotiate something both equally rare and sweet .
va	4	It was not a question , merely a simple observation -- the tone was curious , but lacked the judgmental weight shared by his neighbors .
va	4	Only the cloth stuffed into his mouth held back the howls he would have unleashed as he rolled back and forth , futilely attempting escape .
va	3	He tugged it tighter , thin material poor protection against the current cold snap -- but too familiar and comfortable to disregard over something trivial like warmth .
va	3	He took a moment to adjust the white leather patch that covered his right eye -- making sure it fit snugly and was situated appropriately .
va	4	When he turned to follow her gaze , she grabbed him into a tight embrace -- or at least that 's what it would have seemed .
va	0	Breath came heavy and difficult as Seven 's lungs neared their limits , a line drawn by an undiagnosed asthma that had haunted him since his childhood .
va	4	All Seven could see was her gleaming half-smile , and eyes that peered out of the darkness cast with a warm gold of their own .
va	4	He had seen her go over , and turned back to look down , for some ledge or path she might have used to circle back .
va	2	Mirai shook her head , " Not here , " she said , " if you truly wish to know more , find me tonight .
va	1	What they claimed was brilliant historical fiction was not fiction at all ; but rather the culmination of hundreds of lives of memories and experiences .
va	4	In times like these , " he amended his magnum opus fiercely as he opened fire , " even poets must draw the sword ! "
va	3	Chapter 10 : Trinity Shadows flickered in the bitten moonlight , as swift and evasive as lost faeries , dancing beneath the crystal , midnight stars .
va	1	She moved as lightning possessed , striking low and high , looking for the tiniest chink in the armor , spinning , pivoting , dancing .
va	4	Still , she nodded in response to the question , this was simply another battle in an infinite line of previous encounters , she told herself .
va	1	With a second glance at the smoky apparition , he dashed in the other direction , leaping the new trench and hitting the ground running .
va	0	Undaunted , he saw his opportunity and took off as fast as he could , sprinting as the thunder clap rolled over him like a shockwave .
va	4	At the last moment , he twisted away , shielding Mirai and absorbing the rumbling energy into his own body , stumbling under the sheer force .
va	2	" You know , one of these days your going to get caught Lex , and when you do it 's going to mean trouble .
va	4	They couldn 't ever afford much , but when she was little she had been lucky enough to find the old device that miraculously still worked .
va	3	Of all the games Match Fight was one of the most straight-forward ; the point of the game was simply for Zero to fight another simulated robot .
va	4	Without the support of his legs Zero 's challenger found himself off balance and unable to maintain the footing it needed to support its bulky frame .
va	4	She had to firmly level her gaze down at the floor for fear that meeting his eyes might strip her of what little resolve she could muster .
va	0	His caring creator was scared about something , and judging by the conversation he had overheard he had a very probable idea on what it might be .
va	4	He would either be shutdown and placed into storage where he might never be brought back online ever again , or even more likely ; permanently deactivated .
va	3	There was only so long that Zero calculated he could keep moving without attracting attention by skulking in and out from behind dumpsters or other urban debris .
va	3	Her mouth went dry and she tried to swallow the lump that was forming in her throat but it just didn 't seem to go away .
va	4	He waited for what he thought was an acceptable amount of time , even though he couldn 't be sure before he tried to answer .
va	1	When his inquisitive young friend didn 't seem to show any signs of continuing to speak further he decided it a suitable moment for him to answer .
va	3	As much as she hated admitting it , it was a painful truth that it was only a matter of time before someone else did just that .
va	0	Terror alone held her mind as she found herself unable to find any trace of light or any idea what was going on at all .
va	3	" It bears stating that if you were the primary target that without my intervention our attackers would have been successful , " Zero added .
va	3	" Do not be afraid , " Zero 's electronic voice suddenly shattered her train of thought , prompting her to almost jump at being so startled .
va	2	There is no sign , no building ; they have tried to shut it down for years but nobody can ever find it to do so .
va	0	" I have seen you fight , and with my advice there isn 't going to be anything that can stand a chance against us . "
va	2	Most of the visual output was gone , several of its boards were cracked or fried , but some of its core functions looked to be intact .
va	4	On one hand she was grateful that she had forgotten to clean out the bag but on the other she wished it had been a little fresher .
va	0	Surging into a short sprint he angled himself into a pass that arced around his adversary , maintaining a measured distance between them for safety .
va	1	It was now or never , so without finishing his calculations he punched the full force of his thrust stabilizers to life and threw himself into motion .
va	4	He should be upset at her for tearing into all these materials or at the very least for making use of his shop without his permission .
va	4	He was all mangled up pretty bad before ; like something that has either been through a nasty bit of fighting or one terrible crash landing .
va	2	I can 't have it on my heart you walking out of here into whatever is haunting you to go into some kind of warzone . "
va	0	It wasn 't anything as obvious as your usual ' you have a message ' notification but for her it was as clear as a crystal oscillator .
va	2	When one of the two finally connected with a blow with its only remaining arm the crowd exploded into a thunderous roar of sadistic satisfaction .
va	0	Zero had to push such thoughts from his mind as a gruff voice began to announce the next match and introduced him as the challenger .
va	1	Adjusting his firing solution Zero released a pair of piercing particle beam projectiles that ripped into the helpless hound in a blinding flash of fury and force .
va	1	Zero would normally have been amazed by anyone noticing his proximity without having seen him but right now he was preoccupied with the situation at hand .
va	2	" So which is it going to be , have you decided to see reason or are going to throw these two to the wolves ? "
va	4	You let them go and agree to leave us in peace and I will refrain from releasing every scrap of data about your precious project .
va	4	What he never could have expected was the interest of all four of his children as they eagerly awaited each new ' episode ' every night .
va	4	As much as he could frustrate her , she had to admit Camden did do his best to look after them in his own weird way .
va	4	- Episode 2 - Ever since he could remember Trinity had always been trying to tell him not to do this or how to do that .
va	4	Green fire flew forth in a flash to torment and burn at the servant 's flesh who barely managed to keep from crying out in pain .
va	0	" Because I am getting tired , maybe we could stop and take a nap or you could take a turn packing the big bag . "
va	4	After a few minutes the two had sorted through their pile of items and tossed aside anything they were sure wouldn 't please the Baron .
va	0	Camden and Trinity had actually been fairly lucky picking the path they did ; it had actually led back up out of the rocky walls .
va	3	If they had picked any other path it might have taken hours to find their way , or they might not have found their way at all .
va	4	The hem of her dress was still partially damp ; she was certain she could at least wipe it down and get some of the dirt off .
va	0	One was a rather plain long dagger that wasn 't quite big enough to be a sword but clearly wasn 't a typical dagger either .
va	3	The other thing to interest Camden was a leather bracer , it didn 't have a match but it did have a shiny silver stud on top .
va	3	" Do make certain that should the book not be where you claim then it might be wise to not return until you locate it .
va	4	- Episode 9 - " It 'll be getting dark soon Cam , we really should be finding a place to bed down for the night . "
va	1	" And you honestly don 't think the farmer there will mind when in the morning he 'll find two strange children asleep in his granary ? "
va	4	Every time he used to hear the tales of his deeds retold they always managed to sound bigger and bigger than the reality of the matter .
va	0	" As much as I can 't stand doing actual work , " Camden began to speak as he watched the sun rising in the sky .
va	3	Oh , wait , it quickly occurred to her that he had also pointed out that he despised hearing her say I told you so .
va	4	Mal seemed to be able to read the doubt written on her , the very fact she herself wasn 't even sure was somehow obvious .
va	4	The Baron couldn 't argue with her logic , not really but he also felt like he detected a certain glee creep into her tone .
va	3	It wouldn 't surprise him at all to think that she might possibly enjoy her little plan , much less personally dealing with whoever now troubled them .
va	4	Supposedly the legends had said it was a gift given freely from a Unicorn to a repay an act of kindness made by a benevolent traveler .
va	3	" It was blank , and then all of a sudden the writing just started to fill itself in on the pages - it was even glowing .
va	3	" All I can say is that it is very important that we keep this book safe and try our best to ensure the Vault is secure .
va	4	It was like a massive sledge hammer had connected with them square in the chest , driving their breath from them and propelling them backwards .
va	3	While Thatch looked to the Lady he tried to riddle out what was going on and Cobble settled for keeping his attention on claws and jaws .
va	0	It carried to Thatch and Cobble 's ears and she grinned with a certain sinister satisfaction as she watched her own subtle magic take hold .
va	1	He was ashamed of himself , it was one thing to give her a hard time goofing around since she was his sister but this was serious .
va	4	Once done they sat down into a pair of weathered chairs and Mal 's face dropped the usual stern demeanor replacing it with a grave seriousness .
va	4	There was a certain truth to the boy 's words that resonated within Mal ; it made him feel foolish for ever having neglected his duty .
va	3	" It 's not us I 'm worried about forgetting the plan Thatch , " Cobble countered eyeing the grizzly growling creatures that surrounded them .
va	0	Camden had to fight the urge to smile and wave back as they passed away from the river bank , which was difficult for him .
va	3	" Perhaps it would be wise to make use of this opportunity to share with us a little more about the Vault , " Trinity probed .
va	4	She still longed to understand more of the book she now carried but she also desperately needed to know more of what was going on .
va	0	Summoning up his will , Baron Samael invoked his power as strange letters and arcane symbols flashed to life to hang in the air around him .
va	4	Fear of punishment or not , they would have discovered any of the number of wards or barriers around the tower and perished while trying to escape .
va	0	The only advantage they had left was the knowledge the Vault might still hold a clutch of guardian dragons and they alone had the key .
va	0	A part of her tried to reason how a dragon had suddenly appeared from within the Vault but was quickly lost to a sea of bestial instinct .
va	0	Claws struck out like flashes of lightning to rend the ground and cut through air as Lady Adriana launched her new form into an assault .
va	3	Mal carefully timed his swing when the beast 's right arm shot up to lash out and slid in below it catching it off guard .
va	3	" Justice will be done , " he coldly intoned ; his staff a ghostly pallor that now matched the white on the knuckles that grasped it .
va	3	The thing should be destroyed in that deadly torrent and instead it was shifting , becoming some sinister shadow that was already threatening to slip away .
va	1	Trinity was his best bet to gain any real understanding , and only a fool would enter into a battle ignorant of understanding what he faced .
va	3	The purity at the heart of her magic defied the tainted energies around them , driving it back with a hiss that punctuated its displeasure .
va	0	- Episode 33 - Power roared and crackled as it poured out of Baron Samael 's staffs tip directed downward to seek out Lady Adriana .
va	3	But as soon as the question formed to him he instantly decided that opening his mouth to ask it wasn 't a very good idea .
va	4	- Episode 35 - With each ragged breath Trinity struggled to remain awake , the strain of maintaining her spell growing more and more difficult every moment .
va	1	" Very well , " the king conceded with a slight wave of his right hand , his left still cradling his chin in contemplation .
va	3	Fortune alone provided us with salvation - my companions intercepted items stolen from the Vault allowing us to at least thwart their plan if only barely .
va	3	So far they had found very little to appease their fiendish appetites , but they also had not yet come across anything that stood against them .
va	0	His bearing itself had changed ; the old knight had always carried himself with a detached , relaxed strength that now had become hard and lean .
va	0	" That also means that I am going to need a pair of capable deputies to act as my agents bearing the title of Knight Marshal .
va	3	The question caught both of them off guard , Camden stammered to reply with a ' but ' and Trinity had to find the words for him .
va	1	" Well , no , of course we aren 't refusing but ... " Trinity was now finding herself struggling to grasp for the right words .
va	1	It took a special knack to wield it due to its awkward size ; it was a thick wide blade demanding two hands in its use .
va	2	Don 't worry ; it won 't slow you down like a heavy suit of armor can so you can take full advantage of your speed .
va	1	This staff has been wielded on occasion by wizards in the service of the King and it is said that it can lend you its strength .
va	4	He could leave the defenses to his Earl Marshal , and rightly so ; there was no one else more capable when it came to strategy .
va	4	The sudden surge in magical current immediately alerted Trinity to it 's presence as it sparked to life and set itself to its designed purpose .
va	0	Trinity studied it carefully as she realized a quiet part of her mind was already deconstructing it , analyzing how it was shaped and crafted .
va	0	No , it was far more than that ; what was taking shape was an intricately woven layer of enchantment that was blanketing the keep .
va	4	- Episode 42 - For several long moments there was only silence as Camden and Trinity found themselves standing in the courtyard looking up in awe .
va	3	In all the confusion they had lost sight of the beast from outside the Vault , who was now stalking its way straight for them .
va	4	- Episode 45 - Mal studied the charging beast 's movements as it came at them , carefully looking for anything he could use against the creature .
va	3	At times it was all he could do to hang on , trusting to his companion to keep him safe as they maneuvered through the air .
va	3	It was becoming furiously frustrating ; before it was the one thing that it could feel as sure a threat as anything to its freedom .
va	4	- Episode 47 - The music of life itself flowed all around Trinity ; she could hear it , see it ; feel its delicate warmth .
va	0	So he had anticipated Mal 's reaction , and following upon his old instructor 's lead he launched his own bold blade into a tactically placed thrust .
va	2	" Thatch , Cobble ; it looks like you may yet be able to avoid your fates for failing me , " the Baron coldly cooed .
va	3	Her mind raced to try and make some sense of what it could mean but Trinity had grown too tired ; she couldn 't think of anything .
va	1	So , since it 's the first day , I 'm going to familiarize you with this year 's material , " Mr. Jonson said .
va	4	Tori was still mad that she missed the plane , but knowing that there will be another one the following day gave her a little more hope .
va	3	We 'd like the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for arrival and we want to thank you for flying with us today , " he said .
va	3	I met somebody that might be perfect for you , " she said and dragged him to a guy with blond hair cut in a bob style .
va	0	" Some may say that , some may say Sarah Rutter , " she said in a perfect British accent and sat on the couch .
va	1	" Then what are we waiting for , let 's go , " Sarah said , although she didn 't like shopping , neither did Tori .
va	1	Residence of Anubis House over the past years and archeologist claim that they have seen Daisy 's ghost still haunting Anubis House ' , " Sarah finished .
va	0	She grabbed her bag and pulled Daniel to the third floor , to a big portrait of a beautiful lady with black hair and glowing green eyes .
va	1	" I 'll hide it in my room , for now , " Tori said , grabbed the piece of paper and started walking up the stairs .
va	4	As she walked to the back she dropped a notepad in front of Tori and whispered to her , " You can 't stop me . "
va	1	I 'm sure I 'll waist two pink paper pads just on you this year , " Percy said and wrote Tori a detention slip .
va	1	" She reminds me of somebody , like I said , but I just can 't put my finger on it , " Tori said .
va	1	" I invited your parents , they 're going to be here in half an hour with the president of Lightning Island and his wife . "
va	3	" Here 's your punch , " Daniel said giving Tori , that was sitting next to the edge of the balcony , a glass of punch .
va	4	" I wanted to give you this , like an early birthday present , " Daniel said and gave her a medium sized blue box .
va	0	So anyway , there I was riding in an elevator with a crazy person and I 've got to admit it was a strange experience .
va	3	So we took the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor , got out , and Melissa indicated with her gun I should move east toward the stairway entrance .
va	4	I once heard we were a visually oriented species and I 'm here to verify whoever said it is the most spot-on correct person ever .
va	4	The world goes black and every sensory organ you 've got decides it 's time to give false and misleading information about whatever 's around you .
va	4	The ground feels uneven , sounds come from every direction and your nose is useless ; like a fork with chicken broth or male nipples .
va	3	So I shut my mouth and stood there waiting for my senses to compensate for the lack of sight ... and waited ... and waited ... .
va	2	Maybe a little color coded strip on your finger which warns you when you 've waited a bit too long to do the nasty deed .
va	2	As I look back I suppose I did so because I was ready to forgive them anything so long as it got me out of there .
va	2	Lady , you locked me in this broom closet with my hands tied behind my back after I was shot at and nearly killed on your rooftop !
va	4	I don 't know why I complied so readily but his sheer size was probably part of the reason ; the man was simply large .
va	4	Heck , the person I knew wasn 't smart enough to set her alarm clock let alone go on a shooting spree with an escape plan . "
va	4	It was quite terrifying and I was somewhat relieved I 'd , uh , relieved myself earlier because I believe I might 've done so again .
va	1	" Then , as far as Industrial Products is concerned , the only salesperson they knew who had an appointment with us was Bob Simpson . "
va	3	One sounds like you 've got , at least , the possibility of getting something ; the other hints you definitely don 't have what it takes .
va	3	Oh , I 'm going to watch the game , grab a bite to eat , maybe get a little bloodletting , how about you ? " '
va	3	I didn 't want to ask , I thought I already knew the answer but , like the proverbial cat , I had to know .
va	3	I wasn 't sure what to do next but thought I might use the old Johnny Johnson problem solving technique which worked so well in the past .
va	2	Your blood flowed into my body , then George 's , then Philip 's and finally Vivian 's whose blood was already flowing into yours .
va	4	" Okay , It 's true I was shot in the head but the damage wasn 't sufficient enough to overcome my body 's survival process .
va	0	Okay , technically I didn 't move anywhere near as much dirt as the other two but I was amazed at what I could do .
va	4	But your blood is different ; it can be used by anyone , regardless of what their individual blood is made of " said George .
va	4	Bob and Steve , on the other hand , probably have family and friends who will notice when they don 't show up for a while .
va	0	So anyway , Texas lakes are dirty because they have a silt bottom made of dirt and clay ; both not known for their cleanliness qualities .
va	3	" Well , almost all , they left the crocodiles ; something about the texture of the meat didn 't sit well with them . "
va	3	" When you put it that way it sounds a bit harsher than I would characterize it but , yeah , essentially it 's right . "
va	3	Those little guys , God love them , got so good at the hibernation thing their bodies actually adapted and aided them with the process .
va	3	So they started experimenting to find out why eating themselves was more nutritious than eating fish and do you know what they found out ? "
va	4	" Their hibernation times were based on how many nutrients they could ingest before shutting down ; the more food , the longer the hibernation .
va	4	Now , some might be curious about that statement and I believe it 's because there seems to be a misperception about the city of Dallas .
va	0	Alright , admittedly it was an awkward question because , quite frankly , I don 't know if ' affair ' is a verb or noun .
va	4	" If using one 's own blood enhanced the immune system so much reproduction became impossible what would happen if we used other blood instead ?
va	1	" Anyway , we had a little bit of success with the blood mixing so we kept diluting our blood until finally we found success .
va	0	" We know her name as Melissa only because you told us , we don 't have any idea which Vampire it actually was . "
va	3	I asked and I 've got to admit I was waiting with baited breath for her to do so right there in front of me .
va	3	" I guess it had a little to do with it but the main reason 's because it was Peter 's idea in the first place .
va	4	Okay , when Vampires first began delivering Humans we were very protective of them because they were so cute and vulnerable ; like little puppies .
va	4	For a long time everything I saw on television or read in magazines led me to believe women never , ever , went for the geeks .
va	0	As far as I can tell , modern technology is merely replacing Humans by doing the exact same thing only at a lower cost and faster rate .
va	2	" What I was going to say was ' How does knowing where an individual is located help them monitor all the police reports ? ' . "
va	3	" We don 't really have ... " " I got that part , it 's the other part I didn 't quite understand . "
va	2	The floorboard of the pontoon boat was a disgusting mess with brown , wet clay from the bottom of the lake muddying up the waterproof carpeting .
va	2	" And you 're doing splendidly " said Trudy as she looked up from twisting Bob 's right leg so his foot would be facing forward .
va	0	Now , this normally wouldn 't be a problem but a complication popped up which had the local populace in the area a bit miffed . "
va	4	Okay , the wealthy Humans were in the same boat as us Superiors because the starving peasants were eying them with just as much jealousy and hatred .
va	0	" The titular head of the family was Lucifer but remember we 're a Matriarch so the actual head of the family was Isabella . "
va	2	Now , fear does tend to work in our favor most of the time but it only takes once for a Catastrophe to happen . "
va	2	The four of them left and I began my wild tornado clean-up which consisted of throwing everything not bolted down into one closet or another .
va	2	" You know ; just walk on in to one of those high-priced clothing stores and ... " They were still looking at me strangely .
va	4	It 's true people live much longer and can be kept relatively pain-free but there 's a catch ; someone has to pay for it .
va	4	" Okay , girls , it 's time to leave the room " George said as he picked up the sack he 'd brought from the pharmacy .
va	2	" Hold on ... " I said and was going to follow with the question ' What in the world of Superiors was going to happen ? '
va	4	If a Vampire has in her family a very powerful set of Wolves then her family will be accorded a higher place in the hierarchy .
va	2	" I don 't know , but there 's nothing you can do about it now so ... " " I just need to go there !
va	3	It 's got just the right amount of incredulity to make it believable and they can 't ask you to reveal yourself without making a scene . "
va	2	" Sorry , sorry " Phillip said as he rushed back through my bedroom to enter my bathroom and ... " Come on Bob . "
va	3	" No , don 't worry about it , let 's just see how you like it " he said with a strange grin on his face .
va	1	" Uh-huh " I said and nodded in the way the uninformed and ignorant do when acting as though they have a clue what 's going on .
va	1	You built a prison and ringed it with oil rigs which are this very second pumping out millions of dollars of dinosaur fossil fuel . "
va	0	If you cut their leg off they can just jam it back on and in a matter of a minutes they 'll be walking again . "
va	1	Phillip standing over Bob 's headless torso holding its arms behind its back as the thing kicked its legs like a two-year old throwing a tantrum .
va	3	Nat got a call he was needed back at the station and left so I walked around the apartment to get a better grasp of the situation .
va	4	" Sure , and if they have the resources we 've built up and can lower their prices long enough , they get to win . "
va	4	So they come to Dallas because it offers what many other cities do not ; a place where there is no inherent culture except for commerce .
va	2	" Well , he 's missing his body so you probably don 't have a good point of reference to compare him to " George replied .
va	4	I sighed , reached to turn on the hot water in the sink but stopped because I heard a rustle coming from my walk-in closet .
va	3	Now , he might 've gotten away with it if it hadn 't been for one small glitch in his plans he didn 't account for . "
va	2	" But you said she was fast-tracked out of Vampire school so she could mate with Yin and stop him from killing all the other Werewolves ? "
va	3	" Why didn 't he just ... I hate to say this , but why didn 't he just get another mate or kill Merri Li ? "
va	3	" She was with Yin , but Vampires do not fight in wars , we 're too important to lose in something as unimportant as governance . "
va	3	The combatants were the best the two clans had to offer and the fight began ; three on one , two extraordinary , two not .
va	2	Now , it was two on one and the situation changed dramatically for one of the two seemed not to know where the one was .
va	4	" Well ... then ... " " Just keep pushing , Johnny , I 'm sure there 's another gas station somewhere over this hill . "
va	4	" Well , Trudy yelled she 'd finished fixing our sandwiches so George and I sat down to eat when some cars ran into each other . "
va	2	" Okay , we 've got two pieces of land , both with oil under them and one prison sitting on top , right ? "
va	2	" So we could show people we all belong to the same family ; you know , kind of like the old motorcycle gangs did . "
va	4	" Oh , I don 't know , maybe because I don 't belong to a motorcycle gang and the sight of needles makes me faint ? "
va	2	He took one look at Phillip and decided a seven-foot individual would not order only one hamburger so he took his order and moved on to me .
va	4	" Yep , she was a member of the Food Tribe and was responsible for screening the blood of those who gave for pregnancy . "
va	4	" Yes , the only ones in our family who 'd seen her before were the ones placed in charge of investigating the Catastrophe . "
va	2	So Steve hires Land Surveyors Incorporated who employ Melissa to do a sonar survey and ... hold on ... that means ... " " Yep . "
va	4	" After Merri Li took the heads of one hundred Vampires the Wolves asked for a meeting with Yin to discuss how to resolve their differences . "
va	3	" She was cutting the heads off people , Trudy , don 't you think that 's a little more than a difference of opinion ? "
va	1	" At the beginning of the rebellion Yin , Yang and Merri Li would use Yang 's cloaking abilities to sneak up on an unsuspecting family .
va	1	We can fight them in single combat or in groups so it gives us the best of both possible worlds " he said in all seriousness .
va	0	In my case I was going to do nothing ; just stand there and say a silent prayer to as many Gods as I could recall .
va	4	Or a chicken , or a fish , or whatever other creature we 've been stuffing down our maw for the past thousand years or so .
va	2	" Oh ... um ... Hi , I 'm Johnny Johnson , nice to meet you " I said as I held out my hand .
va	4	" They have evened the Wolves , true , but they 're still down one Vampire and so are one Superior short " she said .
va	1	The room began taking on the low hum which accompanies whispering from surprised individuals as the attending Superiors began discussing amongst themselves what was going on .
va	4	If they accept then they fight , if they accede then they 'll be cast off as unattached and need to reenter another occupation . "
va	3	Cities are constantly alive , constantly churning out production and constantly assailing the senses of the very same citizens they attempt to secure within their boundaries .
va	3	" No , I 'm saying they couldn 't find a cave with the technical ability to allow other families to watch the proceedings . "
va	3	If you want I can check it out for you , it 'll just take a second for me to ... " " Nat ? "
va	0	So , if you 're an Alpha above you don 't want to pick an Alpha below unless you 're sure you can beat him ? "
va	4	" Johnny , walk with me " she said , and I did , because I believe I might 've mentioned her looks a time or two .
va	0	" An Alpha Wolf with you would be able to walk up to any Superior and attack before they had any idea of the danger .
va	4	The Mate of Satan barely survived against Yin ; do you really think he would like to test himself against Phillip and George the same way ? "
va	2	" Why , Isabella , can you not look upon a child sired by your Wolf and not know it for what it is ? "
va	1	It was then I looked around and noticed something quite unusual ; Lucifer Satan cradling the infant in his arms and looking on with obvious interest .
va	4	The overall effect was one of gloom surrounding a square of brown polished wood which made it impossible to detect where the Vampires were at any time .
va	0	" Okay , let 's assume Peter was alive and your family ... " " Our family , Johnny , you are one of us . "
va	2	I looked at both the lovely creatures of boyhood fantasy and I 've got to tell you a guy couldn 't go wrong picking either .
va	2	If you enjoyed this book , please encourage your friends to download their own copy where they can also discover other works by this author .
va	3	Then in the hospital , when he came to , he was raving about something that came out of the blizzards , wasn 't he ?
va	3	I shan 't expect you to do much during your first trimester ... , " " I intend to pull my weight , professor . " "
va	2	... however , teaching our students ; collating our displays , cataloguing our archives and such like will form much of your work until Christmas . "
va	0	For a moment , yet it felt an eternity 's age to Tarleton , he was back on that rocky camp on Baffin Island 's Cumberland peninsula .
va	1	Massachusetts ' fall foliage was spectacular and from his room in his parents mansion high up on French Hill he could see the forests in the distance .
va	2	During the spring and on the voyage up from Boston , he 'd grown out his beard and now looked like a seasoned Viking warrior .
va	4	The men stopped , righted the sled , fixed and greased its runner and sorted out the dog 's tangled traces but it all took time .
va	2	Towards the back of a shallow cave , little more than a hollow scooped out of a rising knoll on the plain , lay three bodies .
va	4	He knew that burial sites were sacred places to the native tribes but those three bodies from earlier didn 't belong to any known Inuit tribe .
va	1	It sank its fangs into Spruce and , as Tarleton stared finding it impossible to move , a slight rose flush suffused under the creature 's skin .
va	3	This dog had more spirit than Spruce and bit and snapped at the creature but for all the good that did , it was like biting snow .
va	1	The monster 's jaws opened devouring the dog , sucking out all its goodness as well as its life-force before tossing its desiccated carcass away .
va	1	It was hard to see straight as his tears froze onto his lashes and the snow pouring from the creature in all directions confused him .
va	4	However all that talk died down to a respectful silence when the bodies of Tarleton and the two orderlies were discovered under the snow in the quadrangle .
va	3	And nothing was said to the Coroner about the trail of giant naked footprints that walked from the infirmary wing then along to the library .
va	2	" And I will miss you both ... Now can you make sure this loot don 't wake up and decide to shoot us ? "
va	1	For the first time in a long time Connor 's mind was a blank canvas and he mindfully smiled as the sleep continued to consume him .
va	3	" I can 't promise that I 'll kill Billy , but I 'll do my best to get him out of the way . "
va	1	He had rationalized why it would be a good thing for Billy to die , but it didn 't parallel his values and respect for life .
va	1	Connor spun and knocked the gun out of the hand of the other man and then delivered a jolting thrust into the man 's face .
va	3	" That 's great , but Babushka didn 't know he was alive until about six months ago when she got a letter from him . "
va	2	" Hello Connor and good day to you too Andre , I was beginning to think you might not show up to our little event . "
va	1	You will be a staff master if you accept my invitation and can observe the first day of fighting with me in my box . "
va	4	That guard will give you five minutes before he comes looking for you and we 've already wasted two of them getting out the window . "
va	1	He didn 't understand why she followed him out the window and was now trying to convince him to go back into the lion 's den .
va	2	Connor envisioned taking Maria back to England and peacefully walking through the forests , but forced himself to focus on what he had to do in Kyiv .
va	3	" That 's all I want , but we won 't be left alone until Billy gets what he wants or he is gone . "
va	1	A city was not the ideal location for training , but he remembered training around the port cities in England and the difficulty of staying conditioned .
va	1	On the other side of the building Connor found himself in front of a large park with tall trees succumbing to autumn tones and winding paths .
va	2	Connor 's voice was resolute as he came out of the bathroom with a terry cloth robe wrapped around his broad shoulders and chiseled forearms .
va	4	" With any luck we 'll have Dominick out of the tournament before it begins which will open a staff master spot for our friend Billy . "
va	3	I have promised you the top staff masters in the world at this tournament and you have seen for yourself our four valiant combatants . "
va	1	" He 's a politician Maria , he 's aware of the danger he 'll be put in if Billy catches him doing this . "
va	3	As the cars started to move he saw the guard who was following them come to a screeching halt at the bottom of the escalators .
va	1	Connor watched the transfer bridge and the escalator entrance for any of Billy 's guards ; he didn 't know how quickly they 'd spring into action .
va	2	" I 'm sorry Connor , you 've got to know that I 've already done too much ... But your friend Lena knows . "
va	1	Connor could see that he had landed several small shots on his opponent 's upper arms , but it wasn 't slowing down the Ukrainian .
va	3	Connor knew it would take them quite a while to navigate through the crowd , but was determined not to fall in Billy 's trap .
va	0	" It 's understandable Connor , after what he 's done to me and to your dad I don 't blame you at all . "
va	1	As Andre slightly paused to gain a firmer grip on his stick Connor struck his friend on his bad knee bringing him quickly to the ground .
va	4	He knew Billy 's tactics of using pharmaceuticals on fighters and he wasn 't surprised Billy would drug someone to launch them into a hysterical rage .
va	1	With one word your friend Andre will die , your slutty girlfriend will be back on the street , and your mom will join your dad ! "
va	2	Connor smoothly stood up , grabbed his fighting bag and journeyed up to the sky box where he would await his name to be called to fight .
va	3	Takeo sauntered onto the pitch and the official made it clear that he would not let Connor do anything until he signaled the fight to begin .
va	1	Before Connor knew what happened he had one of the nun chucks wrapped around his staff and Takeo was preventing Connor from attacking with it .
va	1	Something had overtaken Connor and he didn 't know if it was the pain , the desperate situation , or something he could not understand .
va	0	Billy smiled at the camera and motioned at them to wait a minute and then he turned his back to the camera and made a phone call .
va	1	" Despite what you may think , I am going to make this decision based upon careful consideration of the situation in front of me . "
va	0	He could see that Billy was dressed in a black full spandex suit with padding on the legs , arms , abdomen , and back .
va	2	His conscience told him to stop and deal with the problem , but the agonizing look on his Mom 's face retuned and goaded Connor to leave .
va	0	He swallowed up the countries of Austria and Czechoslovakia peacefully , and on September 1 , 1939 , attacked Poland and thus started World War 2 .
va	0	The Allied invasion was diplomatically a very delicate operation , as they were invading French colonies and France was technically not at war with anyone .
va	3	Abu tossed in his dirty and smelly bag , Drew shut the trunk and both of them moved to the passenger door to try to open it .
va	4	After all , they had been fighting for over three years , and the Americans here in Africa had yet to fight a real battle .
va	0	Andersson was capable in combat , but the preparation for fighting made him impatient , and he increasingly relied on his quiet and very capable corporal .
va	1	She would stand at her doorway , listening and watching , but never seeing anything until midafternoon , when she saw a dust cloud approaching the town .
va	3	The afternoon sun beat down on him , and he tried to wet his dry and chapped lips , but his mouth was too dry .
va	0	" Drew , old boy , " he said to himself , " you have had more lucky breaks today than any one has a right to .
va	1	It was not because of his deadly skill with a pistol that he hit the Arab , spoiling his aim and knocking him sideways in his saddle .
va	4	" This way , " he called to his men as he led the half dozen survivors in a new direction , southeast , he thought .
va	0	The captain explained how he had lost all of his gear and how he had been wandering around yesterday and today , avoiding German troops .
va	4	He was able to double his feet up and kick him in the abdomen , using the momentum to somersault the hapless Arab over his head .
va	0	He was also a natural target for the bullies , and he had cried more than once at night , using his pillow to muffle his sobs .
va	4	At first she stared around her , not understanding where she was , the mists of a dream of a happier time fading from her mind .
va	0	The sun was sinking in the west when Captain Matthews , who was in the lead , came to a rise and saw two buildings .
va	0	He had such an air of command about him that she had been shocked to discover that she was actually a little taller than he was .
va	4	But just to be on the safe side , maybe he should see if he could get some of the other men on his side .
va	0	Dane shot a look in that direction and saw the road through a break in the hills , about a mile away , with traffic on it .
va	0	He was so mad he snatched his helmet from off his head and dashed it to the ground ; it bounced up and almost hit him .
va	4	While the men got back into the vehicle , Drew made sure he helped Angelique into the cab and received her smile as a reward .
va	3	He took a mouthful of water and spat it out , " Well , it 's wet , " as he tasted the mineral rich water .
va	1	Both of our parents were only children , so there aren 't any uncles , aunts or cousins , and our grandparents had died by then .
va	2	I had to take care of Amy and I couldn 't if I went to school , so I had to drop the request and find work .
va	3	You can 't let it master you , you have to master it , and sometimes you have to do it a minute at a time .
va	1	At his continued look of surprise , she hurried on , " It , it is for my grandfather , to be buried in . "
va	1	The major glared after him , wishing he had his Gestapo men with him instead of having to rely on stupid German soldiers to do his work .
va	0	" Relax , and enjoy the company of a handsome man and food you didn 't prepare yourself , " he said with a smile .
va	4	As a matter of fact , I became friendly with some fishermen who lived near there and they took me out with them once . "
va	0	I was soaked and it was hard work and I would hate to do it all my life , but it was a blast . "
va	4	He would make sure that there were no Germans in the café the next day , maybe that would bring the spy out of his hole .
va	2	Dane frowned and mused out loud , " I don 't know if I 'm going to have trouble with him in the future or not . "
va	1	Listening to Dane talk about being born again was just like her dream , running and trying to catch the meaning , but never quite achieving it .
va	4	" I agree with you , it is the logical answer , but , " he paused , " it doesn 't feel ... right . "
va	4	" I heard that the money from the Jews never made it to the airport to be flown back to Germany , " one of them said .
va	4	When he told her that , she looked him right in the eye and said ' you are the right age for me . " '
va	1	" Oh , to be back in the old days , sitting on the Left Bank , sipping wine , and flirting with all the young men .
va	2	If you try leaving by the back door , the Germans will certainly be on to you and it will cause suspicion to fall on me .
va	0	" Maybe if I use this handkerchief to wipe my face as I walk out , until I can turn away , maybe that will work ? "
va	3	" Oh , it 's a new company , just starting , I am trying to line up some contacts , " Drew stammered a little .
va	1	As she bounced along in the truck , the refrain kept going around and around in her mind : Dane and Drew , Drew and Dane .
va	1	All of them noticed the change in the captain ; instead of asking questions and relying on Dane , he was issuing orders and taking command .
va	3	He wouldn 't admit it , but he didn 't want to remain here for long just in case the corporal was hot on their trail .
va	0	As she tried to pull her head away , he shifted his hold so he had a free hand , which disappeared under her clothing .
va	4	He knew that within an hour he could be dead , but he felt no panic because he knew that he would be with Jesus .
va	3	As the blood returned to his feet and hands , it was causing excruciating pain , but he tried to hide it from his captors .
va	0	Once both feet slipped and he caught himself with his right hand , the pain in his shoulder tearing at him , but he forced himself on .
va	3	The three of them stopped talking , looked at each other and started laughing almost hysterically , trying to put their arms around each other .
va	4	As he looked at her , he realized that he was in love with her , but he wasn 't sure how she felt about him .
va	4	There was a wide rent in it , if he could throw a grenade into the hole ... He armed both of them and flung them .
va	0	They heard a sound , and Drew saw an Arab with a greying beard step around the shoulder and point his long rifle at them .
va	4	The soldiers of every other country in the world had to fight for a year before the soldiers learned to fight and survive on the battlefield .
va	1	During junior high school , he wrote a series of science fiction stories about a soldier and his adventures fighting in China , Mars , and space .
va	0	Although Dane did not hear what Braun said , he could see what Braun had said echoed in his men as he moved among them .
va	0	She had no sense of what time it was , but the air felt warm and a hazy sun was visible above the airport buildings .
va	2	Stopping only to drop the rucksack off her shoulders and chuck her purse on the bed , Claire fell forwards and lost herself to oblivion .
va	1	Looking down , she saw she was still wearing the clothes she 'd put on Saturday morning , when she left her sister 's house .
va	2	Claire Many thanks for your email indicating that you would like to accept my proposal of writing a column on the hostels of New Zealand .
va	1	Our readers are considering holidays in hot countries and , as it is winter in New Zealand , it is unlikely to appeal to them .
va	4	Please do feel free to submit to us any articles that you produce and we will , of course , consider them alongside our other freelance writers .
va	3	She thought about the price of her airfare , about the opportunities she 'd given up by leaving the country without talking to Carl or Conor .
va	4	A tiny white lighthouse and a signpost showing how far away they were from the places of the world , were the only evidence of human life .
va	4	Visible only by the whites of his eyes and his shimmering teeth , Claire recognised her nemesis and cursed herself for responding to his summons .
va	2	Not wanting to give him an opportunity to goad her further , Claire took a step away from the edge and scanned around for another empty pool .
va	4	The space was larger than she had imagined : the lights emphasised the vastness , as their eerie glow illuminated the contours of the ceiling .
va	4	So far he 'd been gentlemanly in actions , if not in attitude , but she still felt his presence like that of a predator .
va	3	The urgent message to her feet wasn 't getting through ; they remained stubbornly stuck to the ground as Neal turned on his most sardonic stare .
va	0	Claire had lost all sense of how many laps she 'd done , until she saw a flag waving to indicate it was her final time round .
va	4	After all the nonsense with Neal , and the turmoil at home , there was a freedom to being somewhere no one could find her .
va	4	Every part of her body ached , as if she had spent the day before stretched on a rack rather than hiking through volcano country .
va	4	Deciding that , if necessary , she would cling to the raft rather than paddle , Claire focussed all her energy on listening to the lecture .
va	4	I 'm never likely to come to this country again and I couldn 't even keep my eyes open for a few hours to admire the scenery .
va	3	She needed to be on the South Island , ticking off tourist sites and making her way to Christchurch and a flight back to the UK .
va	0	Also by Amanda Martin : BABY BLUES AND WEDDING SHOES Amanda 's latest release , the chick lit novel Baby Blues and Wedding Shoes is available now .
va	1	Readers with an appreciation for a bit of reality and a bit of hopeful romantic wishful dreaming will not be disappointed by this lovely tale .
va	0	The travel guide had made a big deal of the fact that the airport was built on a completely man-made island in the middle of the bay .
va	4	It also mentioned that a lot of the fill was local refuse and Mike wondered if any of it had been found floating in the sea .
va	0	Mike had travelled before and so was not feeling all that stressed about waiting around the arrivals area in a strange airport in an Asian country .
va	0	Taller than Mike , thin , with a neat appearance the man held out his hand as he announced in an American accent who he was .
va	3	Next to the kitchen was a room that could be separated by sliding doors , making it either a part of the kitchen or a separate room .
va	4	Planning a brisk thirty-minute tour before coming home to a shower , Mike decided to leave everything but his wallet and key in the room .
va	4	From in front of the station , Mike could see that there were more vending machines lining the bare concrete walls of the station building .
va	3	Walking along the front of the station area and entering the first street along , he immediately noticed that it was lined with vending machines .
va	3	There he stood staring at the traffic light flashing the ' don 't walk ' light and mused that the sign must be a message .
va	0	He realized that he was again verbalizing parts of his inner dialogue and that to strangers he must have appeared to be a frantic , babbling lunatic .
va	0	Luckily , the traffic was stopped already , the crosswalk sign was flashing green , the machine gun was whirling and the melody of misery was playing .
va	4	While he waited , he did some mental Japanese practice and tried to work out how to ask what he needed to ask in Japanese .
va	0	She already knew that his Japanese was crap , so she just stared and smiled back nervously , waiting for him to take the lead .
va	4	Mike looked around noticing that some other staff did the same , while one of the male staff members was shaking his head in disbelief .
va	1	He felt like a bull in a china shop -- albeit a Japanese China shop -- clumsily knocking down and smashing the surrounding social conventions .
va	4	Embarrassed , he turned and raced out of the store , feeling the sting of the imagined laughter on the back of his neck as he exited .
va	0	There was not a lot he could do about human nature , he realized , and it seemed he had a lot to learn about Japan .
va	3	He pointed out though , that on the back , written in pen using katakana characters was the name of Mike 's apartment block , Daichi Heights .
va	3	He thought about how stupid he must have looked and started to feel like a country bumpkin on his first trip to a big city .
va	4	It was a serene experience and a welcome break - a left turn at the end of the rice field and serenity succumbed to opulence .
va	0	As much as he hadn 't planned any of this , it was an education and he felt that he was experiencing a lot very quickly .
va	1	He didn 't need to contact the English conversation company for two days , as the training began on Monday and it was now Friday night .
va	1	Young men looking and walking ' just so ' in fashionable suits moved in and out of the multitude of restaurants and bars lining the streets .
va	1	Jon , sensing that his brazen remark was not being taken in context , tried for some attention again , this time ordering a drink in Japanese .
va	2	Imagining how ridiculous this must have sounded to her , all of them except for Jon burst out laughing , while Jon retained his composure .
va	3	It would not be true to say that Mark was entirely sober , nor that he had honorable intentions -- but none of that mattered .
va	4	" Yeah , " he roared melodically , in a rough but rounded male rock growl , absolutely appropriate for the melody and the style .
va	2	He chose a song that would allow him to skillfully shout his way through the melody , hiding his lack of control and quality of voice .
va	2	The girl moved to position herself ready to stand from the bar stool but Jon put his hand on her right shoulder and began to push down .
va	3	People began to turn their attention away from Jon and the girl as the icy mood of the snack bar began to thaw a little .
va	3	That way , they don 't have to pay each time they want a drink and it looks cool when they are chatting up a girl .
va	1	Today he symbolizes not only safe sailing and plentiful fishing but business prosperity for merchants in all trades and success to people in any occupation .
va	3	Others had told him , that as long as you kept your distance from the Yakuza , there was no need to worry about them .
va	4	Mark stood much taller than the man and was at least three times larger , purely by muscle weight -- and yet he was intimidated .
va	4	The house was to the right , and it was necessary to cross traffic , over the concrete island and over to the other side .
va	0	The hallway was particularly narrow and dark , allowing enough space for a body and one raised elbow , without space to swing a cat .
va	1	" That no one in this country really gives a fuck about eating Moby Dick and his friend Flipper , except those fucking nationalists . "
va	4	In his agitated state , he began to feel he needed to make a stand against what he was beginning to perceive as discrimination against foreigners .
va	2	He walked out into the crowd and felt insignificant , his mood slipping down through a series of gears almost to a state of depression .
va	4	He looked around the cell , there was no toilet , there were no holes in the concrete floor and only a tiny little porthole window .
va	0	He then felt despair as the phone was yanked out of his hands by a young policeman and his backpack was picked up by another .
va	0	Translated , this meant that he turned up late , left early and had lots of holidays -- all for a comfortable salary and no responsibility .
va	3	Look , there might be one or two sticky questions , but I can assure you that the rest will be standard , run-of-the-mill stuff ' . "
va	1	I don 't ' need money but he say ... no , no , I pay ... but no ... I know ... he not pay .
va	3	The train was just pulling in to Umeda station as Mike sent a quick last-minute text to Jon , asking if Mark was coming to Happy Hour .
va	0	He caught himself , shaking his head in judgment at such a stupid act and thanked the gods that he didn 't have friends like that .
va	4	At the table next to him were a group of Japanese men and women in their mid-thirties , happily engaged in conversation and alcohol consumption .
va	0	Mike 's gay radar immediately flashed red , before he was distracted by Mark , Jon and Tsubasa , who had come to sit at his table .
va	4	questioned Mark with a disrespectful smirk on his face , a beer held to his lips hiding the true degree of contempt in his expression .
va	3	Seizing the opportunity , he stood up , insisted they wait and began to move the table towards the other in order to join them together .
va	4	Tsubasa seemed a little disappointed but bowed politely as Mark , out of the corner of his eye , noticed Kaori walking down the stairway .
va	2	Subconsciously zoned out of other conversations , Mark ignored Mike 's sad and obvious denial of unrequited love , continuing to attempt humor with Kaori .
va	1	Josh was used to this order , so he stood and was cuffed by the officer , the cuffs pinching the skin around his wrists .
va	0	Things kind of ground to a halt after this and there was a long silence -- perfectly acceptable in Japan , although awkward in any other country .
va	2	" Look , I just don 't know what to do ... I mean ... umm should I do it ... the interview I mean ?
va	1	The thought of losing his only reliable ' confidante ' was weighing heavily on his mind , particularly in light of his last conversation with the detective .
va	0	Kenichi 's office was actually a few blocks up from The Cantaloupe , so the area was familiar to Mark once he had his bearings .
va	2	" Ok then ... look , I 'm going to go into Shinsaibashi to do some shopping and I 'll be catching up with Marley .
va	4	She ate quickly , showered , dressed then came down downstairs , leaving the dishes in the sink on the way out and left without saying goodbye .
va	1	* * * The taxi pulled away onto North London 's Chingford Mount Road , leaving Amy searching beneath the knickers in her handbag for keys .
va	3	Bidding Danny goodnight she zigzagged across the threadbare living room carpet and passed the kitchen piled high with dirty pots and plates to the bathroom .
va	3	Biting plastic wrapped passport and money he eased into the water ; the contrasting temperature took his breath away as Katherine indicated him towards the stern .
va	4	Katherine watched him look it over as she would a computer 's innards -- or like someone who 'd lied about being able to play guitar .
va	2	' Look , if you don 't want to sing -- ' Too late Calvin began strumming chords before nervousness got the better of him .
va	0	Saturday 18th June 1983 The following Saturday the lads shopped in London 's Denmark Street for an amp to replace Danny 's ailing practice amp .
va	1	Ignoring Danny 's crudeness Calvin said , ' Of course , he 's not rejected us musically , because he hasn 't actually heard our songs . '
va	3	Amy speaks well of you but , being honest , last night you didn 't strike me as guys I 'd want to start a band with .
va	4	But because 10,000 Faces is still embryonic if we 're to do stuff together he wants an equal part -- like a founder member . '
va	3	Let 's crank it up and see if we can get this thing singing , just the way you want before you start looking at pedals . '
va	0	' So , ' Raphael said drying the pot Calvin passed him , ' if it 's true we can think our way to rock stardom . '
va	1	Looking but finding no cracks of insincerity Danny thanked him saying , ' You did a fine job ; the sound was crystal on stage . '
va	2	Danny looked around the now three-quarter full room but the guy said , ' Door count says only ten of this lot are yours . '
va	0	* * * Later that night finding herself alone with Danny , Amy said , ' You 've not had a girlfriend for a while . '
va	2	' I haven 't brought anyone back here or gone back to anyone 's house since -- ' ' I know , I 'm sorry . '
va	3	Almost breathless at the top of the stairs he saw Danny signal the barman who 'd turn the jukebox off after whatever current track finished .
va	1	Picking a spot on the stage he watched it diminish with lift-off and enlarge again as his feet touched down with cymbals crashing his eardrums .
va	3	* * * Back in the flat seeing Calvin put the kettle on Raphael said , ' So it 's just me going out ? '
va	3	In fact , ' he said reaching to his pocket , ' take a card it 's got my number on it just in case . '
va	0	Danny set his guitar on its stand as Amy , sitting by his amp , watched students fail to access the hall for a glimpse of Bananarama .
va	0	* * * An hour earlier Katherine , fearing she 'd got the wrong polytechnic , saw Bananarama posters that didn 't mention Calvin 's band .
va	2	Though Katherine didn 't know how long she would or could stay with Calvin she swore to stick by her rule both financially and socially .
va	2	' Nah , Amy seems to like you and if you turn out to be dodgy it 'll be no more gigs for Little Spirit . '
va	1	' I 've not told anyone but before you arrived I was starving myself of sex -- like Danny would stupidly think I was a virgin . '
va	4	The distant cliffs reached the horizon , where a chemical factory with two metal chimneys tirelessly raced fat swirling worms of smoke into the sky .
va	4	That said Tom changed his tune once Raphael came to record his parts saying he 'd never worked with a drummer as accurate or expressive .
va	0	Barbara hoisted Katherine 's bag as Amy ran with mother and daughter along the street of dead gardens , boarded windows and clapped out cars .
va	4	She didn 't breathe under the gaze sinking to her chin , neck and chest freezing her as Alan 's contempt reordered forming contemptuous lust .
va	0	But worse than that , though she 'd missed him , she found herself not wanting anything to do with him -- friends or otherwise .
va	4	After some minutes of conversation Raphael asked , ' Is everything okay , I 'm guessing you weren 't just ringing for a chat ? '
va	4	* * * When everyone hit the venue 's bar John collared Katherine and said , ' The weather 's still warm in Saint Tropez . '
va	1	Looking thoughtful she said , ' I 'm thinking my romantic feelings towards him were based on there being no danger of anything actually happening . '
va	4	I was thinking we should play streets like Brook Green where the EMI and Virgin offices are -- you know , put it under their noses . '
va	4	' Wasn 't it JFK who said , We do these things , not because they 're easy but , because they 're hard ? '
va	3	' Like I say , without distribution it wouldn 't appear in the shops and without PR or Marketing the masses won 't know about it . '
va	3	When a label tells you that , it usually means they 're not looking to sign new acts ; not that many admit it . '
va	4	Amy reckoned the only remaining date on the flyer would yield another no show as the poly 's main hall lay miles from GMD 's Camden office .
va	0	Now , what I have here , ' Richard said pushing a stack of paper towards Raphael , ' is a one album recording contract . '
va	4	When it didn 't work he took Raphael 's , leave ' em wanting more , advice by actively ending the conversation saying he 'd ring Raphael .
va	0	As requested he pulled the car into a courtyard where a Range Rover , a tractor and a fine old Jaguar stood by stable doors .
va	0	' Well , ' Calvin started nearly choking on a raisin and looking between Katherine and Barbara , ' we haven 't actually discussed that . '
va	0	Calvin remained watching as Alan 's brain , like a computer performing damage reports , ran check after check each one coming back , ' okay ' .
va	3	Austin 's studio had become available but , they 'd have to wait until February the following year if they didn 't start recording in two days .
va	2	Instead of Tom 's contemporary black and grey decor Austin 's control room had shabby brown walls and carpet , not soundproofed doors but hefty traditional oak .
va	1	Austin balancing sounds ran from room to room fine tuning the drum heads and swapping Raphael 's felt kick drum beater for a wooden one .
va	2	Amy took photos and John tried getting into them all until around 11am her camera ran out of film and John ran out of questions .
va	3	Raphael stood up as if that 'd be the hardest thing he 'd have to do that day and led the way to the live room .
va	1	Thursday 22nd December 1983 On their final Thursday Calvin stood on Hall Manor 's stage singing his parts , his fingers happily finding their frets .
va	3	On stage and into the set their certainty of the songs ' strength warmed the audience who couldn 't help but fall into sympathy with their vibe .
va	3	' Anyway , Raphael you 're lucky to be walking out that club taking the mick out of that other band and nicking their girlfriends . '
va	0	' So if they put masses into a band by way of a six-figure advance they 're going to work damn hard to get it back .
va	2	If records start flying out of targeted shops Gallop will look closely at how it 's being promoted and how many are being returned . '
va	0	If I was a girl Grace 's age and interested in you I wouldn 't want to read that you 're happy in a relationship .
va	2	' Of course , ' Raphael said setting the mug on the floor so he could pull a piece of paper from his coat pocket .
va	1	' Not this time , ' Danny said though he hadn 't so much invited Calvin as told him he intended to go running with Amy alone .
va	1	Giving up forcing his face to relax Calvin said , ' I 'd better go , the girls won 't have such luck getting backstage . '
va	3	He left and found Katherine and Amy by the bar starting their first glass of dry white and stopped ten feet short to admire them .
va	2	* * * Putting their faith in the makeup girls who plied on foundation and eye shadow the boys edged towards a post new romantic look .
va	4	We 'll probably go through the song ten times to make sure we 've got what we need by which time the audience may get restless .
va	3	Calvin with a firm command of rhythm and having performed the song on stage many times felt a little put out when the instructions seemed so basic .
va	3	As the lads bore down on her , the first one she 'd danced with that night moved in front and threw out a halting hand .
va	3	An hour later Little Spirit played to a full house delighting Richard and Des and many who had attended the video shoot still sporting Little Spirit T-shirts .
va	4	The jeans and sweatshirts had given no suggestion of the body that existed beneath and now Raphael 's heart raced seeing what he 'd been missing .
va	3	She tried to make it look like fate by getting Johnny to say certain things from the stage ; like it was meant to be .
va	0	We saw his band a few times and just had to have that guitar because I went all over London but couldn 't find one as good .
va	1	Once it was disguised I did as I always did before I had pennies to rub together , I told people I 'd won it .
va	0	' They sound like animals , ' she said taking his hand as if flirting would dilute her feelings of betrayal towards Danny having met Marlon .
va	4	But Amy had already made her mind up and slipping her feet into her shoes she headed for the front door without saying bye or being seen .
va	3	Through further questions Katherine learned that Barbara had bought a passport and from the description guessed that her mum had left the country with John .
va	2	But now Richard and I , without the aid of the William Morris Agency , have got you into a whole new batch of venues .
va	2	Not normally given to praying he found himself asking someone somewhere for good fortune as the lift took off through the floors before halting abruptly .
va	0	Of Raphael 's carpet comment Dave said , ' You guys are fantastic , no doubt about that but it 's still early days . '
va	2	' Normally we move on the when a shop runs out of records but , because it 's you ... ' ' Aw , thank you gorgeous .
va	4	When he went in you guys were on the video screens too so he reported back to base and someone checked up via me . '
va	0	Before Katherine could think of a suitable answer Amy said , ' You 've just equalised ; you and Calvin both pulled a music journalist . '
va	4	Puzzled , Amy approached , tapped and put her head into the room where , on the desk , her books stood all orderly awaiting her attention .
va	0	Danny gave a wave and received a cheer back though felt somewhat fraudulent given that half of them had appeared at the sight of TV cameras .
va	1	When Richard hung up Raphael banged on Calvin and Danny 's doors and shouted , ' We need to get to Manchester by 4pm . '
va	4	' You 're right it 's easy to forget how long ze journey is amongst ze excitement of interviews and ze few sell-out gigs we 've done .
va	3	' The shop owner told our guy that this is the first copy he 's sold since the first batch of just three units came in .
va	4	' We get a lot of bands on , like yourselves , who 're looking for exposure and they might bring some skill but perhaps little else .
va	1	* * * ' Morning , ' she said kicking Danny 's door closed behind her and setting the tray of tea and toast down .
va	3	We all know this the flat isn 't big enough for the five of us so we need to think about alternatives starting now . '
va	3	After the chitchat ran thin Trudie said , ' I 'm really sorry but I 'll have to go and see what 's holding him up . '
va	1	On this hand you have proven yourselves to be highly styled , highly entertaining on and off stage , highly industrious , and incredibly hard working .
va	0	' This may be a factor in how you guys managed to attain such a high place without constant airplay and a Top of the Pops appearance .
va	3	He didn 't give a thought to the traffic passing behind until without a second 's warning an opened Coke can clattered into the pavement .
va	4	' She 's getting ludicrously priced plates for this wedding , ' he said before running through the points Richard had made the previous day .
va	2	Tuesday 8th May 1984 Amy waited for signs of life the following day and got up when she heard Calvin going to the living room .
va	4	Following The Tube national interest in the band continued to flourish and , as the weather became hotter they pulled greater crowds in London 's parks .
va	3	' Still , I 'd just love for us to get our own tour ; see our names at the top of the tickets . '
va	0	Marlon 's anger and assault of Amy had maddened Danny but that the aggressor might now be back for more saturated Danny 's being with indignation .
va	4	John 's agreed a 6pm meeting at the properties so let 's hope it 's quiet enough in the pub for Katherine to get away early . '
va	4	Wednesday 23rd May 1984 The deal on the new houses came together so quickly there wouldn 't have been time to move without a dawn start .
va	3	' I tried to be as honest as I could but truthfully I couldn 't say your mother and I were no more than friends .
va	0	Katherine launched into what had happened punctuating everything with , ' I 'm so annoyed , ' and , ' what really makes me angry . '
va	0	The photographs took an age so as soon as Katherine , Amy and Barbara had been snapped a couple of times they headed back towards the marina .
va	3	' They have , they demo 'd it in London and John gave it to Gareth , not that he mentioned it was Little Spirit . '
va	0	' I 'm sorry we couldn 't tell you about the gig , ' Calvin said when his bandmates and Amy left for the bar .
va	0	' What a fabulous room , ' Calvin said getting comfy ' Hmm , ' said Katherine as the previous night 's feelings spiralled back .
va	1	Stu believed only he understood Johnny 's stoicism but as songs passed he tried but couldn 't guess what had spooked his pal so badly .
va	1	' And Trudie 's too wrapped up with Little Spirit , as GMD are right now , ' Johnny said as if reading her mind .
va	1	Carlisle , Cumbria , UK : Friday 26th April 1974 Ten years earlier near the Scottish border , Barry Peters sat alone in his bedroom .
va	1	Bring me a song that says what you want to say and I don 't mind how rubbish it is or how rubbish you think it is .
va	4	Boxes , for the content of which I felt no immediate use , were stored in the garage or on top shelves in the closets .
va	4	This box , " STORIES " , ended up in my daughter 's closet , and this is where it was found five years later .
va	3	She actually did it in the evenings , which was not that bad at all , because it reduced competition for the bath in the morning .
va	3	" I was trying to tell my parents that I was sick so I could stay home , but they did not buy it . "
va	2	So she went back to school and followed her parents ' advice to study sciences , choosing molecular biology to work in a research lab .
va	3	John was already pulling on the door , when Bradley heard the sound of footsteps and thought that this time it had to be Megan .
va	1	Forests , fields and rivers , occasional villages , and forests and fields again , just as in old grandfather 's clock with rotating pictures .
va	0	" As simple as this , " John began , and Megan figured that he was probably the least scared of all at that point .
va	3	She expected John to start explaining how cool he thought this was and why , but the three mentors promptly advanced towards her and the boys .
va	0	The door behind him closed , and John was left wondering what the Adventurous meant by saying that Bradley and Megan were not too far away .
va	1	While Bradley was trying to remind him that they were running out of time , John just waved his hand and continued with his idea .
va	3	Which was great because , needless to say , John was not ready with the robot that day or ever , to tell the truth .
va	3	And if they didn 't see Megan , then they would have their wits about them to think of a way how to find her .
va	3	The Adventurous did not seem to mind that John also behaved rudely and went on with his explanations , " Oh , that I will tell you .
va	1	" I don 't think this kind of thing will work for me , " John said cautiously , slowly recovering from his initial shock .
va	1	But there was no reply for very long time , and John kept banging on the wall and shouting until Bradley finally showed some signs of life .
va	4	Megan even turned back because of being scared of such a possibility , but the hole , through which she came out , was gone .
va	2	He heard John 's footsteps , then John said , excitement in his voice , " Good , finally , so how did it go ? "
va	3	He started to climb the ladder , but after the second step turned around , jumped on top of the Tenacious and started to fight .
va	3	He could not be sure that the Unknowns did not have a mechanism to find out what one had been doing without having to watch that person .
va	3	He realized that it was not as much physical exercise that he had to do , but emotional wear down that made him tired the most .
va	3	He insisted that Bradley kept trying and that without flying he would be stuck in this room forever , and what good does that do to anyone ?
va	3	He was going to say that they should not and were not going to master flying and take the flying test , had John already forgotten ?
va	4	Therefore , by articulating it he might let out the fact that he , Megan and John were aware of the danger of learning how to fly .
va	1	" I 've been sitting in this room for days and because I still don 't believe in flying , I can 't get out .
va	1	The girl might not be telling the truth and was indeed send to her by the Unknowns to spy on her or was an Unknown herself .
va	3	" It must be because Bradley doesn 't know how to fly yet that they are not allowing him to get out , " John decided .
va	3	He was not sure that at this point John would listen to his pleas to not fly in order to not get stuck in this country .
va	3	He was left in his room , now without his friend next door to talk to , and desperately started thinking of a way out .
va	3	They 'd been in this country for much longer , and they had plenty of opportunities to start flying if not to take the test already .
va	2	That did not work so well , but eventually she managed to lift Mary high enough for her to come through the ceiling into the room above .
va	3	Out of the corner of her eye , Megan noticed that Mary was getting impatient , but Megan was convinced that talking to Rachel was very important .
va	3	Megan made a conclusion that everybody , or at least the majority of the people who passed the test , lost the capability to think clearly .
va	2	" However , if the money does convert into books , you will have fun reading them , so it 's not a catastrophe . "
va	1	" Speak for yourself , " John said , hoping that Bradley was right and nothing would happen to the money since nothing had happened yet .
va	2	This way , in his opinion , there would be room for books in the backpack should they appear , and the money would be safe .
va	4	When John returned back from his rides and started sharing with Bradley the events of the day , Bradley did not really want to listen to him .
va	1	It was as if history had frozen , and for many years , on and on , there was only one Chief and no historical events .
va	2	He skimmed the book for any mention of time control or anything of the kind , but there was no mention of time at all .
va	3	Megan told him about traveling through the walls , finding the exit and them coming back to get him , John and Mary 's friends .
va	3	" Yes , this flying thing totally transforms you , " Bradley agreed , moving to the very end of his bed and told them about John .
va	4	While she was falling to the floor , the Tenacious easily flew through the opening in the ceiling and could be heard laugh as it closed .
va	3	That laugh of his told me that your trick isn 't in their rule book and he wouldn 't be expecting us to be gone .
va	2	The point was that the door was clearly locked , and for John that was good enough reason to turn around and go back to his room .
va	3	Then repetitive shouts of command , noises of metal things falling and hitting other metal , more shouts ... " It sounds sinister , " said Mary .
va	4	We don 't know whether we can run away from here , and we have to be prepared to act in case they find us . "
va	3	Generally , it 's wrong to sympathize with those who don 't want to learn to fly or try to help them in any way .
va	3	" Well , I am not supposed to be doing this , you know ... " began the Adventurous , but John saw that he started hesitating .
va	0	John was hoping that some money would be left by the Adventurous ' disability to carry all of it away , so he was really disappointed .
va	0	And then who knows ... It was a real surprise to him when two days later John appeared at work in a role of a guard .
va	3	Bradley and Megan got out and hid under the train for the entire time it was unloading , which took almost the entire day again .
va	2	One proof that we are no longer the land of the Unknowns would be to see a person who is older or younger than us . "
va	4	James was dropped off , and Bradley at the last moment realized that they needed to exchange emails , which they barely had time to do .
va	2	The book you just read is one from the series of stories about the World of the Unknowns , whom I imagined when I was a child .
va	4	As I was getting older , the characters and the story line changed , but the idea behind who the Unknowns were , always stayed the same .
va	3	Instead , they were scolded for getting lost at a tour during a vacation , but still , still , he was back home in America !
va	4	When the elevator door opened , his father stretched his arm as if to prevent Bradley from rushing in without waiting for people to come out .
va	3	He was hoping he would get a chance to talk to Dustin if his father turned on music and would not pay attention to their conversation .
va	4	He and Megan unpacked their suitcases as fast as they 'd never done before and were shortly running downstairs to the garage with the laundry baskets .
va	3	They did not discuss it , but independently decided that given the current situation it would be wise to be obedient and respectful to all adults .
va	0	He had no idea what happened in school and what those individuals whom everybody thought to be him and Megan manage to accomplish here on their behalf .
va	4	Bradley and John were taken out of the classroom , and had to sit in the principal 's office until their parents arrived and picked them up .
va	0	If before there was a slight chance of convincing his father that his behavior changed , now for sure his father would not go for it .
va	4	Remember I slipped a couple of weird phrases in the car on the way from the airport that made you think I was nuts ? "
va	3	Claire thought through the new awkwardness of their relationship , as she kept pace with Josh 's long strides and tried not to pant with exertion .
va	1	Now , with an autumnal nip in the air , she was content to dig her toes in the sand and soak in the beauty .
va	0	He 's clearly crazy about you and , I have to say , you talk a good talk but I 'm not buying it . "
va	0	" Show me a man who has actually grown up and I 'll show you a boring bastard who takes life far too seriously . "
va	1	Not that I can blame him for wanting to evade the responsibility of raising children : it 's not something I 'm in a hurry to do .
va	4	The rigid routine , the upholstered seats , even Bethan 's unending good humour , felt like a cage that she was finally free from .
va	2	Claire looked across the racks of clothing to Bethan , who was holding up various items against her and contemplating her reflection in the mirror .
va	2	You won 't remember most of it in the morning and I promise not to remind you more than , ooh , once an hour ? "
va	4	Claire realised with a start that the rest of the group had walked on and she shuffled after them , nearly dropping her camera in her haste .
va	1	Giant sails blocked out most of the sky , although she could just see glimpses of pink from the setting sun in the gaps around the edges .
va	4	Bethan swam languidly up to where she lay , and propped her chin on her crossed arms so she could watch the people walking past .
va	4	This far south , winter had the island in its grip and she was in no mood to linger , despite the beauty of the scene .
va	0	As she arrived at the car park , she saw a girl load her camera into her bag and climb into a rusty red hatchback .
va	4	Following a cycle path , Claire walked around the edge of the lake , beneath the autumn trees , kicking at the fallen leaves beneath her feet .
va	3	The further she got from the town the lighter she felt until , at last , the buildings were out of sight and she felt like skipping .
va	3	This will entail visiting hostels and tourist attractions in the surrounding counties to undertake a benchmark exercise on where Isle of Purbeck tourism sits at present .
va	2	She let herself out the back door and stopped to pull on her boots , then stood and stretched , inhaling the cold morning air .
va	1	" So , if I 'm wearing nice clothes and I brush my hair , I must be a city chick , as you call it ? "
va	4	Claire searched through her brain , wishing Bethan were there to come up with an amazing solution or fill the room with her endless optimism .
va	4	With a shrug , she tried to convince herself it was just a possession ; no different to having her phone stolen when she was mugged .
va	2	If it hadn 't been from Kim , she would have worried that it was a goodbye note from someone intending to do something foolish .
va	3	The thought that he 'd arrived too late , and was too distraught to contact her , ran over and over like a stuck record .
va	3	Claire could almost taste the cool refreshing tang of tonic with a slice of lime , and she took a swig of water to wet her throat .

va	1	Readers with an appreciation for a bit of reality and a bit of hopeful romantic wishful dreaming will not be disappointed by this lovely tale .
va	2	For a moment Carol was not sure how to respond , but took a deep breath and invited Sam to join her in the kitchen .
va	0	A quick call and she booked a flight the next day for her husband , departing in the morning at the time Sam had said .
va	4	Zoe watched both the buck , who took notice of them and stepped up its effort , and Harry who struggled to keep the gun case steady .
va	3	With a clear night and no wind , he anticipated the drama of this white vastness yielding the show to a starry night 's sky .
va	0	" If I was sure that we could get out safely , if I knew what was ahead , I would give it a try . "
va	3	But it doesn 't mean I caused the storm , and it doesn 't mean I wouldn 't have told you about the road . "
va	3	Otherwise it was at least a squirrel or two , but he would trap them in a hole -- couldn 't waste the ammo on something small .
va	1	He thought about his own children and their first kicks from inside -- how he 'd joke with his wife that their personalities were already showing up .
va	0	" God , what an insane way -- " She shook as another blinding wave of pain pierced her , but this time , she was waiting .
va	4	They began yet another brainstorming session , agreeing that this would be the final discussion and that they 'd quit only when they arrived at her name .
va	0	Gravity gained the upper hand , and doing a kind of comical dance , she flapped her arms in a failing attempt to steady herself .
va	3	Unlike other faster sections , the current meandered by at this particular spot , and so the stream only occasionally hinted at carrying the shirt off .
va	3	" After it had gotten dark , when I was out here last time , I watched a car 's headlights cross the horizon . "
va	3	# Zoe watched his ministrations , knowing that she had to talk to him ; sooner than later , if she could only find the right moment .
va	4	Feeling the carrying sack would never be warm enough , Zoe thought to sleep with Laura on her chest , much like how Harry held her now .
va	3	He looked away from the blinding headlight until it passed , at which point he began to hurtle the dirt -- the timing was critical .
va	0	When we first crashed , it was okay -- actually , I was relieved that no matter what , I wouldn 't be saddled with a baby .
va	3	In fact , I so fear it that I couldn 't discuss this before hand -- I didn 't want to light your fuse prematurely .
va	3	And so I steeled myself to counter with all the thrust of youthful enthusiasm , " only I 've got it all figured out , you see .
va	1	" Oh , yes , of course -- " Bink said slowly , " yes , yes , yes , yes , sorry about that .
va	2	He turned on his heel , and with the air of someone who has just narrowly avoided some minor misfortune , took off into he crowd .
va	3	I bought a desk -- this took a lot more care as it was to be the chief wellspring for my inspiration -- and a typewriter .
va	3	This census lark would only last a few months , after all , and it might prove to him that I could do something useful .
va	1	For lunch I 'd escape to Ratner 's on Delancey for an onion roll , and by evening I usually had to take something stronger .
va	1	The white stone buildings had turned blue against the snow , and the first signs of light stood out in yellow squares of windows and shop displays .
va	0	Then a tall , carved mantle fronted by a round conversation table on a clawed pedestal , six more chairs , and a grandfather clock .
va	1	* * * * * Back in the living room , I opened the drapes to reveal the city dazzling in its own artificial starlight .
va	1	I looked out over this new , naked , fragile world , and took slow sips of tea , finishing his last sentence in my mind .
va	0	" Everybody clear out , " Ed said , " Take a break , be ready to work again in half an hour , understood ? "
va	2	* * * * * Half an hour later , Hank was nowhere to be found , so shooting had to go on without him .
va	1	After hanging up his uniform and cleaning up as best he could , Chuck drove over to Hank 's apartment to check up on him .
va	4	" You really must come , " she said , " Everyone will be there , and Ed will be making an important announcement . "
va	0	" Attention , please , " Ed said , raising his glass , " I have a toast to make , and an announcement . "
va	1	It seemed like a dismissal of sorts , so Chuck turned away , unable to stop the suspicious thoughts that were swirling about in his mind .
va	1	She was crying silently , big tears running down her face , running black with mascara and getting soaked up in the cloth that gagged her mouth .
va	1	Once a living , breathing person , he is now an undead agent of the supernatural , impervious to death in all of its conventional ways .
va	1	I found a few when I was hiding and I stopped using those spots so I 'd be safe , but I still wasn 't .
va	4	He knew I 'd have little memory of the episodes , but he also knew about the sensation of peace and the feeling of flying .
va	4	That means they are either destroyed , or worse , they 're sent off with the threat to endure whatever torment was meant for the protected one .
va	3	Well , some of that crazy stuff is true , " he said , " and separating the true from the crazy is the fun part . "
va	0	Not to be confused with David McCullough , the author , historian , and lecturer , Dave McCullough is an author , software developer , and craftsman .
va	0	Makeshift portable lighting had been organised , heating was available at certain times of the day and a system of provisioning had been put in place .
va	4	He was so proud of his red beret but rarely wore it when on leave as attitudes had changed for the worst towards uniformed soldiers .
va	4	He and Marie had become heavily involved in voluntary work for the vulnerable in the community and John derived great satisfaction from the work they did .
va	4	Chapter 2 Eighteen years earlier 2018 The economy had got progressively worse as a privileged few took more out of the pot than they put in .
va	2	More often than not , they waited for a bank to show signs of failing before jumping in to buy at a knock down price .
va	3	The Government had long since stopped bailing out failing banks but not before they had pumped billions into them , buying up most of their toxic debt .
va	0	Two others , ex Para Graham Johns who was now a police officer and Paul Cobb an ex Marine , was an expert in explosives .
va	3	It was proven that they were party to importing young girls from Eastern Europe and taking fat hand outs for arranging the necessary import documents .
va	3	2nd Infantry Brigade will despatch its battalions to the major cities and towns outside the Capital to maintain order in the event it gets out of hand .
va	4	A canvas sheet was rolled out on the roof of the pen whenever there was rain but the wardens took their time putting that in place .
va	2	' What are you going to do about it prick , why don 't you come in here and show me what I should do ?
va	0	He saw that her hands were gnarled and painfully swollen , her face ravaged by years of hardship and plainly she was not in good health .
va	3	' I guess you know me better than I know myself so I won 't pretend that tonight will be a turning point in our lives Marie .
va	2	Before I continue , you have the right to walk out now if you feel in any way uncomfortable with what I have said so far .
va	0	' Thanks Paul , I 'll leave it you and Derek to report back with a plan of what you are going to do and how .
va	4	' I will be visiting the towns and cities outside of London over the next 2 weeks and making contact with our group leaders there .
va	3	He told her everything that had taken place that evening and asked , ' do you want to go along with me on this ? '
va	4	I can get hold of a small quantity of explosives and detonators but I need some help to me get in and out of the place .
va	1	Our return route may or may not be underground and that part of the plan will be finalised after I have the report from P and D .
va	2	John saw the look of recognition on Alan 's face and said ' the nurses will do their best to sort you out Alan . '
va	3	Most importantly you will be a part of a movement that intends to change everything that we know is wrong , back to being good once again .
va	3	No Henry , I will not deviate from the course of action I have taken , action that will benefit this country in the long run .
va	3	John 's fear was that the State would try to flood the tunnels or use gas once they knew that the tube was the fighter 's base .
va	0	John stopped him , ' leave it Alan , I knew you would have a problem and that 's why I want Janice to help you .
va	2	' Ok , Mr Walker but promise me you will get back underground as soon as we reach my front door and I have got home .
va	0	Janice leaned against Alan as they walked and all too soon for Alan they reached Janice 's apartment block , she stopped at the stairwell entrance .
va	4	' Of course John , ' she smiled knowingly , ' I 'm very well thank you , ' she said in her normal chirpy way .
va	1	' Then he is a worse criminal than I imagined and I swear to God that he and his cronies will pay for their crimes .
va	3	Graham tried to contain his reservations , ' isn 't that upping the ante a bit and putting us in the same camp as them ? '
va	4	' He 's being held at Kings Cross police station John and I believe they won 't be moving him for at least three days .
va	4	I ' ve called you together because we have a very important and I have to say dangerous job to do within the next three days .
va	1	John noted Alan 's anger but continued , ' Mal , I will need two vans that can carry six of us and equipment in each .
va	4	Within minutes two vehicles approached , one from the North , the other from the South each carrying six armed and black clad masked men .
va	0	Alan was still trying to absorb what he had witnessed and was concerned by his own lack of sympathy for those they had just killed .
va	0	I 'm sorry but all that we can offer him by getting him to a medical facility is more of what he has already endured .
va	4	Reynolds was surprised that his MI5 colleague was able to make such a conclusion ; he had not done so although he could now see the link .
va	4	Chapter 8 The year 2036 John stirred from his memories of the job at Kings Cross eight years ago when Jason came and sat next to him .
va	0	As with all movement in the network , there was always a fear of what was around the next bend or waiting in the dark shadows .
va	0	As they carefully traversed the walls of the old building Jason was first to spot a distinctive mark that was similar to an old War Office arrow .
va	2	' Yes John , Alan Walker , he 's been on a number of operations with us and is proving to be a good soldier . '
va	4	' No problem , we 'll go there together now and you can tell me what you 've managed to find out on the way . '
va	3	More importantly , the general expert opinion was that it would take at least two years to fully integrate the data and ensure back-up capability .
va	3	Millions of pounds of computer hardware have been installed and it currently has a copy of everything that the CIO has written on to its system .
va	4	' I sincerely hope so Commissioner , I 've already had one Chief of Police demonstrate that he wasn 't up to the job . '
va	1	John was in favour of going in under cover of darkness and escorting Mr Harper to the nearest underground station , which would be Notting Hill Gate .
va	1	Greg thought for a moment ' I guess all of them with exception of Boyce who I believe is back raking in money from his banking activities .
va	2	' Don 't worry , I won 't have second thoughts , I 've been praying for some time that someone like you would turn up .
va	3	' Sorry to interrupt Sir but Brendon and I have an idea about picking up Mr Harper that we would like to talk to you about . '
va	0	Do not give him my name but just that your commander knows that he has a small porcelain ornament of a tiger on his mantelpiece .
va	2	' You go on ahead and park yourself on a bench close to the apartment ; I 'll follow on in about 5 minutes . '
va	1	John extracted his hand and said ' My name is John and for the moment I have no intention make myself known to our enemy .
va	4	There would be time later to discuss the finer details of future action ; for now , he would let them enjoy their renewed friendship .
va	2	Mason could not rely on Police support either ; the new Police Commissioner was out of his depth and just did as he was told .
va	3	He decided that his best option would be to create a situation that would force them to attack and he would be ready for them .
va	4	Do we know how they are able to appear and disappear at will and why do we not have any intelligence on any of the perpetrators ? '
va	4	Four of the deep shelters , two north of the Thames and two south had been fully equipped to house several thousand civilians and soldiers in each .
va	0	I will not nor cannot give any assurances that there will not be a difficult road ahead but I know that we will achieve our goal .
va	3	They were each told the same thing , ' I want two things ; I want you to search your conscience and I want your clothes .
va	3	' Yes I am interested but I 've got far too much to do that would make it impossible for me to leave right now .
va	0	He fell to the ground and unable to maintain his balance scraped his face and hands as he contacted the rough surface of the road .
va	0	John had always known that this time would come and he wasn 't surprised that his picture now appeared on wanted posters all over London .
va	2	As a starter , I want you to point out to me the two individuals who were responsible for the death of one of my men .
va	4	These individuals were considered a threat to the regime and we are paid to see to it that the threat is removed ; no questions asked . '
va	0	So I personally don 't give a shit what happens to me and I certainly don 't give a damn what happens to you . '
va	4	' It 's a pity you didn 't take the time to count , maybe you would have been aware of the wrong you were doing .
va	4	I want a lock up prepared for our two guests where they will be secure until it is decided what is to be done with them .
va	4	Adam got up and banged on the cell door ' you had better get in here ; you have a dead prisoner on your hands . '
va	4	' Yes I have and it shames me deeply to know I have been party to inflicting the misery that these people have to endure .
va	4	When the riots and the lawlessness were at their peak , I felt justified and even patriotic in helping get the society back to some normality .
va	2	' I somehow figured that was the sort of response I 'd get from you so I have a proposition for you to think about .
va	0	I will arrange for an advance party to check out the Southgate location and if it 's clear just you and I will go inside . '
va	0	' We know his personal details and his military background we also know he and his group are well armed , well trained and organised .
va	2	I 'll get it set up now , so good luck my friend and don 't worry , we won 't be too far away . '
va	0	I am pleased to say that riots , criminal activity and antisocial behaviour have almost been eradicated and that is a great credit to you all .
va	3	The main focus would be on the Northern line , one would enter in the North at Hampstead and the other from the South at Clapham South .
va	4	Here at least we 're not taken from our beds in the middle of the night and thrown into one of your Con pens . '
va	2	Before John could respond the Platoon Leader picked up his radio , ' Delta 1 to all sections abort your mission now , I repeat , abort .
va	3	JD flicked on his transmission switch , ' Delta 1 to Bravo 24 you will be allowed to return to the surface shortly without obstruction .
va	1	Now I 'm being asked to fight against our own people and tonight we were responsible for the death of innocent civilians including two children .
va	2	JD , I will assign one of my commanders to you until you are fully up to speed with how we operate and what our plans are .
va	3	The General stood up slowly and standing to attention saluted the Union flag that was draped in the corner of the room , turned and left .
va	2	What are you going to do about the terrorists causing so much disruption and how will you deal with the obvious disquiet amongst the ranks ? '
va	3	It was decided not to use the station for security reasons given that Judge and his men have already taken two units down from within Police stations .
va	3	' Terry take him to the execution cell then dump his body outside Mason 's office ' John turned and started to walk out of the door .
va	1	The ' special duties ' squad had become sloppy and undisciplined mainly due to inactivity and lack of direction So Derek completed the task with minimal fuss .
va	4	The loss of Derek particularly was devastating for John and the other founder members given the years they had worked together and the sacrifices they had made .
va	4	The three men walked on to where a group of men were standing around a warming coffee pot ' ok if we join you ? '
va	0	' Greg , from what I have heard so far I am really optimistic that the framework you have outlined is a fantastic way forward .
va	3	He knew that they were about to desert on the night of their capture but still felt the firing squad was not the way to punish them .
va	3	The two spent the next three hours planning the operation ; an operation that John thought would turn the odds in his favour if successful .
va	2	John commanded Mrs Mason to keep quiet and calmly told her that she would come to no harm if she did as she was told .
va	0	He was a small man dwarfed by the six-man arrest team who were physically carrying him out of the room clad only in his boxer shorts .
va	4	He called an emergency Cabinet meeting and was particularly interested on what the military and the Police plans were to recover Mason from the rebels .
va	4	On the open side , newly set into the ground , were the three wooden posts that would restrain the sentenced soldiers to face their executioners .
va	4	He looked to his Sergeant , ' take two of your men and escort the General back to his quarters and keep him under guard . '
va	4	He wished she could be with him now especially now that he was about to launch the final push to take back the country for the people .
va	4	We are sure there will be no resistance from the nurses and doctors although the foreign owners of the private clinics may squeal a bit . '
va	3	I will now take this opportunity to ... Terry Bayliss listened with pride to what was being said as Greg started to elucidate elements of the charter .
va	0	Claire Thank you for sending through your initial findings , they appear satisfactory , although I have not had a great deal of time to peruse them .
va	4	If she looked around she might notice the steep drop down to the rocks below , visible beneath the white froth of the crashing waves .
va	3	I 'm staying at the Tintagel hostel tonight ; just spent the day at the castle , so hopefully I 'll be able to write about that .
va	1	" Just fixing up my sixties semi costs a fortune , I can 't imagine what the upkeep on an old Georgian pile like this would be .
va	4	It really was like flying , to stand on the waxed board and balance atop the waves as the beach rushed up to meet her .
va	4	Claire stared at the message again , trying to read beneath the surface , as she always felt compelled to do with messages from Conor .
va	3	At last she spotted a sign up ahead pointing to the castle , and then there it was , about a hundred yards from the sign .
va	4	Then she remembered they would be leaving in the morning to catch their flight , and pulled her phone out to send a quick text message .
va	4	Her early confidence evaporated and she could feel the hot flush rising up her neck as it did when she felt out of her depth .
va	4	She found him sitting in the courtyard , looking relaxed in an open shirt and sunglasses propped on his head , despite the clouds gathering above them .
va	4	She wanted to pull her hiking boots on and stride down to the beach , to let the sea breeze blow the dark thoughts from her mind .
va	4	However little she knew about looking after boys , it didn 't seem as if they 'd get much more care and attention from their dad .
va	3	She didn 't want to think about it too deeply , so she said , " Well , if you 're sure , that would be great .
va	0	He said it wasn 't your fault that Father 's a ... " He stopped again , and a faint blush put colour in his pale cheeks .
va	2	" Probably not , " Claire replied , wondering if Conor would find another excuse to drive the hundreds of miles from Dorset to Cornwall .
va	4	Just because you 're in lurve , " he drew out the word , " doesn 't mean the rest of us have to be boring . "
va	3	As they left the breakfast room in relative harmony , Claire felt that she might be starting to get the hang of this parenting lark .
va	2	Hooking an arm through Jack 's , she held out her elbow for Alex to hold on to , not really expecting him to take it .
va	4	" Well , I might not be very good at making you behave , but I do know a café where they sell very good chocolate cake .
va	3	And very vulnerable , she thought , watching the boat pull at its mooring as the wake of a passing yacht stirred up the water .
va	0	He nodded in their direction , as if stumbling across a casual acquaintance , rather than coming to collect his sons after a two-week absence .

va	4	His younger brother , Neil , was thirteen and put in charge of babysitting Catherine 's three-year-old son , Michael , who was a rascal .
va	1	The pictures of his family placed around the room were all facing at him as if his mom had planned on him sitting in that chair .
va	3	He knew if he told his mom the truth she would just say that all it meant was that the military did what all militaries do .
va	3	Mac wanted to point it out but didn 't want to embarrass him before he revealed what he had really come out here to talk about .
va	3	Mac would admit that it sounded strange that the military wouldn 't let certain soldiers go home but he was sure the commanders had a good reason .
va	4	There was , however , a message from the offices of Major Spacer Commander Littleton -- that was the third highest rank in the military .
va	0	Then he contacted the only man in Passage with an Imp to get an unbiased update on what Mac had missed while he was unconscious .
va	4	" If we find out you set that hover car on fire to destroy evidence , then I will gladly be the one to take you away .
va	3	Mac was fighting the temptation to try to get some information out of Raymond , but he didn 't think that Raymond would tell him anything .
va	3	When she got to the hospital she jumped onto the ramp , slid down the wall and thumped to an abrupt stop at the bottom .
va	1	It was hard for Mac to think of his family in those conditions , especially the young kids , but he couldn 't help it .

va	3	In front of them , on the north side of the river , was a small transmission tower with a tiny red light blinking on top .
va	4	With his free arm , Raymond punched Mac in the jaw and then pushed up with his other arm in an effort to free himself .
va	0	Mac grabbed that arm and twisted it so that Raymond was forced to roll from his back to his stomach or his arm would break .
va	3	Just remember that no matter what you choose to believe , don 't try to convince me that what I saw didn 't really happen .
va	3	It 's complicated , and still in the testing stages , but just before I left my lab they were talking about starting human testing . "
va	3	Using their Imps to get found was the easiest way to get out of the city , but it was going to be under military custody .
va	3	Other soldiers noticed , and realizing that Mac and Jace were trying to get to the shuttles , they started running back to the ships .
va	3	Chapter 10 McAllister The shuttle stealing scheme went off without a hitch , and Mac was soon on his way in the ugly Earth Living Shuttle .
va	0	I 'll do what I can to get your package , but as soon as you leave I 'll go back in my made-up world . "
va	0	Brindle opened a door -- it was a foot thick -- and obviously had a hydraulic assist mechanism because he didn 't have to pull very hard .
va	3	He wished he could talk to Lynn about it , but he would lose the advantage of gathering information while his captors thought he was blind .
va	2	A promise from a man who had just claimed to have killed millions of people just to control the population didn 't mean a whole lot .
va	0	Mac wondered if the only man in Passage with an Imp had done that on purpose , just in case Mac was still in there .
va	2	" Yes , and I approve of the general direction , but our charts don 't show the planet you guys are looking for . "
va	4	That green went around the rest of the horseshoe and was only broken up by another mountain range that ran along the outside of the horseshoe curve .
va	4	The base , or at least the only group of manmade objects as far as I can tell , is the source of the pull . "
va	1	I should be with my husband , but I 'm stuck with you and Raymond and I don 't even know what 's going on anymore . "
va	3	He tossed the battery in the air , caught it , tossed it again , caught it ... He had no idea what to do .
va	2	" You 're just going to end up dying on some planet no one has ever heard of for reasons you don 't even know ! "
va	3	" My question isn 't just ' was it really aliens who attacked Northgate , ' but was there ever a war to begin with . "
va	3	The rocky terrain made it hard to crawl out the back , but he made better time when he got around to the shuttle 's side .
va	4	A boulder , five inches taller than he was and as wide as his outstretched arms , stood between him and the front of the ship .
va	3	He couldn 't avoid getting bits of gas on the suit when he climbed in the shuttle , and he didn 't want to accidentally touch it .
va	2	Mac was amazed that , in the absence of footholds or places to grab onto , he could punch into the rock without hurting himself .
va	3	" If we let this gas out , we won 't be able to steal a ship from that base to get out of here . "
va	3	They got to the bottom of the shaft in minutes , doing things that would have broken normal people 's arms , legs , and fingers .
va	4	It was hard to tell how far up they were but they were up far enough to look down on the disk shaped pull machine .
va	4	He and Lynn walked through the opening and saw miles of wires and tons of metal girders that were covered in a thick layer of dust .
va	4	There is no one here named Janelle Stewart , so just put the gun down and let 's be calm about all this , okay ? "
va	3	The skin around the burn mark wasn 't glowing as much as the rest of his body , but the gas did have healing qualities to it .
va	0	Just as he was leaving , he thought he caught sight of a glow in his peripheral vision , but he couldn 't turn around now .
va	1	Even though Mac now believed him , he still thought Zinger was an insane , blood thirsty animal for killing millions of his own people .
va	3	Part of his plan was to get on the alien space ship , but now that he was here he wasn 't sure what to do .
va	2	Every once in a while one of them would stop , a door would open in the wall in front of them and they would go inside .
va	2	When all four of them were in the room , the door closed and the room adjusted its size so that they could all fit comfortably .
va	3	The big black man had to stand nose to nose to establish a connection with Mac , but that was not the case with the Janelle impostor .
va	2	Now that he was ready to take on a ship full of aliens , he realized he still didn 't know how to open a door .
va	3	Some people turned and followed him , but no one chased after him except for the cloud of the military guy that was trying to attack him .
va	2	Just as he took care of the last one -- the sick looking dog with a too long tongue -- the soldiers started coming down the stairs .
va	2	A command deck protruded from the top of each ship , and weapons ports formed a dotted line all way round the long oval vessels .
va	0	When it slammed into the ship , its prongs were so heavy and had so much power behind them that they easily punched through the hull .
va	4	Now that he didn 't need to eat , drink , or breathe to survive , he feared he would just float through space forever .
va	2	The ambient light from windows and docking bay door allowed Cliff to see the outline of the explosive containers and the shocked looked on Rory 's face .
va	1	Digging her toes into the mud , and pulling hard on the sapling -- praying it wouldn 't give -- she struggled up onto the bank .
va	1	With shaky fingers she picked one of the keys from the key ring and , though poking and missing at first , slid it into the deadbolt .
va	4	With a start Lizzie woke , the book she had been reading lay face down next to her pillow , the pages bent underneath it .
va	4	In the morning , during " The Basic Four , " Math , English , Science and History , her mom caught her daydreaming three times .
va	4	Her dad stood behind the desk where she could see his face , and the Cardinal was on the other side with his back to her .
va	4	" Yes ... , but it may not be as great a consequence as it so happens , " the Cardinal said , speaking with deliberate precision .
va	3	Lizzie 's dad did not respond , but she imagined that he would be angry with the Cardinal , though she couldn 't quite understand the accusation .
va	0	But I became your grandpa 's Second when I was only ten , and you are every bit as ready as I was at that age .
va	4	The Nephilim were in the earth in those days , and also after that , when God 's sons came in to men 's daughters .
va	3	He would jump up , or dive sideways -- but he didn 't try to bat the ball away -- he tried to catch it .
va	4	At the end of end of the period he ran back to the bench to find his mother holding his water bottle in her hand .
va	1	He thought his mom was being more than a little optimistic as far as him being president , considering that she was an illegal alien .
va	4	The trees here were large , and their boughs stretched out toward each other and made a dense web that covered the entire area in shadow .
va	4	He knew no one could have heard him as he splashed in the mud , nor could they hear him as he ran down into the ravine .
va	4	Lizzie moved to the edge of the wood , leaning this way and that to see if she could get a glimpse of the dog .
va	0	After the game a woman with a notepad and a man with a camera on a tripod approached the coach , and Simpson then waved Manuel over .
va	4	There were twelve sigils on the silver chain , ranging in size from the size of a nickel to the size of a half dollar .
va	4	" Ahh ... yes ... right here , " he said , picking up a glass coke bottle , empty save for a splinter of black metal .
va	3	Manuel knew he was thinking about the imp , though it didn 't seem that there was much chance they 'd find it still there .
va	0	He disappeared into his room for a moment , and then came back with his black leather jacket on and a duffle bag under his arm .
va	2	" Okay , if you two don 't want to watch , you can go look around and see if she has any friends with her . "
va	4	With so much emotion bottled up , the sense of pride caused it to all bubble over , and a lump formed in her throat .
va	4	A few strands of her blonde hair were stuck to her face where her tears had made it wet , but her blue eyes blazed .
va	1	" Okay , " he said , shaking his head , " but your failure to cooperate will make the investigation that much more difficult . "
va	1	Muscles popped out all over his hairless body like on a bodybuilder ; his powerful looking arms he held crossed in an X across his chest .
va	0	With a sandpaper sound Nick imploded into a spot , and all that remained was a cicada , bug eyed and buzzing its clear wings loudly .
va	4	Manuel again looked up at the clamp , measured the distance in his mind , and tossed the other cable up so the clamps caught together .
va	2	Chapter 31 -- The Wood Witch Manuel and his mom followed Gordon on his motorcycle through town and then onto a highway and finally into the suburbs .
va	3	Manuel was surprised when they did not take the path into the woods and instead took the narrow dirt road that led to the fields .
va	0	He had thrown the rock , and he 'd hit the sorcerer , and the girl -- Miss Long -- had finished the job with her kicks .
va	0	Lizzie held out her hands and Nick held them , and though he wasn 't any taller than she , his hands covered and hid hers completely .
va	3	But you have to know that Lori would have never been in that situation if you hadn 't talked to Nick in the first place .
va	0	She had had dreams like that before , where an emotion was simply a part of the landscape and had little to do with what was happening .
va	3	In the 2030 's and 2040 's the Earth 's population had gone from 9 billion to 1 billion in just a little more than a decade .
va	2	Both of them dreamed of and wanted more from both life and love , and both had the kind of personality and stubbornness to wait for it .
va	2	Wearing colors were common mostly for those 35 to 40 or younger , and very common at Festival for those 15 to 30 more normally .
va	0	There was a brief pause as they slowly turned away from this distraction , a break in interaction like taking a breath before diving again .
va	4	" Let 's catch some sounds " Lawrence suggested , happy his friend had found someone , he even found female companionship for him in the process .
va	0	" Straight up " was all that Sk ' lar said , short for agreement with and recognizing the approval that Marcus had given it .
va	4	He hair was feathered , and she wore a pendant of a leaf sprouting from a seed within a circle in white gold around her neck .
va	1	" Your dad and I ain 't stupid or blind , baby ... You 're goin ' to the Shore with him I 'd guess .
va	3	Lucinda finished the conversation on the fly , going downstairs to load their little electric utility truck with four bags Jules had packed the night before .
va	3	I know you ain 't much for that , yo , but ain 't like I 'm gone , just a little bit away . "
va	4	When the train pulled into the station in Red Bank he grabbed the two biggest bags and she the smaller two , and they exited the train .
va	4	They didn 't need words to communicate , and this was natural between them and was as refined as if they have been together their entire life .
va	2	I took the liberty of digging through your work , hope you don 't mind , and I 'm interested in the kelp farming project . "
va	3	The Shore had been one thing , but now this dashing young man was taking their little girl to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with him .
va	2	Al approached his son and shook his hand saying , " You 'll never know how proud I am of y ' a son , eh ? "
va	4	They emerged later sensing that they were the butt of jokes that were playfully being told about them , and realized they didn 't sneak by anything .
va	0	Big Mama flinched a little , and she made a slow downward thrust of her fluke which swamped him and sent him around in a somersault .
va	4	Lawrence had always been a little bit scattered and more concerned about hitting the pubs in Red Bank than doing any kind of real work .
va	0	Sky went to a far corner and sat at a terminal and composed an email to his parents , Orion still staying close by his side .
va	4	, sexy pirate wenches , humor , bloody violence , drunken debauchery , a healthy serving of sex , and even some philosophy and subtle social commentary .
va	4	He quickly tied the docking rope around the paddle in case it got knocked off the kayak in the rough water and laid as flat as possible .
va	4	After several more minutes of beating , tearing at the husk , and cursing , he managed to separate the inner nut from the husk .
va	0	As Jeff had hoped , Harrison 's first attack move was to slice the head off of the mop handle , leaving a reasonably good fighting staff .
va	3	Jeff moved his grip on the mop handle so that he could attempt to block and parry with both the middle and ends of the staff .
va	3	Without hesitation , Jeff lightly tossed the two pieces of mop handle into the air in front of him and caught them at the ends .
va	0	" Well , Captain , he paddled his canoe up to the ship and be callin ' fer help and I had him climb aboard . "
va	3	As I made my way around the outskirts of the storm , I spotted a strange object that appeared to be falling from the sky .
va	0	As the Captain took his seat at the table , he asked , " So Mr. Greene , are you a sailor as was Captain Stivers ? "
va	3	There are weapons so powerful that an entire country , or for that matter a continent , could be destroyed in a matter of minutes . "
va	2	It was now dark outside and it took a few moments for his eyes to adjust to the dim light provided by the moon overhead .
va	2	Robinson turned up the flame on the lantern on the wall before walking over to a wooden box at the foot of one of the bunks .
va	3	Still staring at it , Robinson 's expression changed , " Now that I 'm getting used to it , I rather like it . "
va	2	I don 't want to interrupt your work , but I was wondering if you might boil me some water to help my hangover . "
va	4	As the men smoked , Jeff asked , " Captain , please forgive my ignorance , but are you a privateer or a pirate ? "
va	4	Over the next few months , I , along with a few other of my brethren , shall be raiding several Spanish settlements along the coast .
va	2	" Do you have any suggestions on how I might make some money to get me started if I do stay in Port Royal ? "
va	2	" Well , Mr. Greene , if you decide to stay in Port Royal , you could do worse than to work for Mr. Franklin . "
va	4	A short discussion with the men followed , with the 4 men breaking into hearty laughter , but then falling silent before nodding their heads .
va	4	She reached her hands behind her head and untied the dirty bandana covering it to reveal shiny straight black hair that dropped to her shoulders .
va	1	" You go in first and I 'll come in a bit later , just to make sure nobody suspects us , " she suggested .
va	4	Turning to Jeff , he continued , " Mr. Greene , these men have each lived many years at sea as well as here in Port Royal .
va	2	I was on my way over to the island of Utila on a small boat with my son when the storm came up out of nowhere .
va	0	In any event , I am glad that you were watching my back when all I had asked of you was to watch your own . "
va	4	Jeff heard Crabtree mutter thanks to God at the announcement as he waited for some sign of anger or resentment from Graves , but there was none .
va	1	" Yes , Captain , there are sharks and such , but with some precautions , swimming in the sea is not that dangerous . "
va	3	" I 'm not sure yet , but I 'd like to take a swim around the ship to see what the options might be .
va	0	Realizing what was happening , it was all Jenny could do to keep from laughing out loud as she clamped a hand over her mouth .
va	0	Jeff was now stifling a laugh and Jenny was still convulsing silently as the stream finally stopped and they heard footsteps leading away from the rail above .
va	3	" Let 's just say my mouth was in the wrong place at the wrong time , " Jeff said with a laugh of his own .
va	1	It was still quite dark , but there was a faint line of orange and red sitting low in the sky signaling the approach of sunrise .
va	4	The crew fell silent as the Spanish ship picked up speed and Jeff 's heart sank with the knowledge that the sabotage had somehow failed .
va	4	In a few moments , although it was heading in their general direction , the Spanish ship was rapidly approaching the edge of the reef .
va	0	Jeff watched as a moment later the Spanish ship came to an abrupt stop and the sounds of wood cracking and men yelling carried across the water .
va	4	If any of the crew gets injured , there 's a good chance they could get septic and die from what would otherwise be survivable . "
va	2	He looked around the cabin and realized that one priority was going to be cleaning the room to try to minimize the potential for infection .
va	2	Jeff looked angrily at Harrison who shrugged his shoulders and said , " Captain not say nothin ' ' bout toes , did ' e ? "
va	4	The process was repeated with several more members of the crew , and gradually Jeff was taking over the control of his arm from Harrison .
va	4	They load the same as the pistols , but ye use the larger powder horns , " he said pulling a rifle from the box .
va	0	Less than half an hour later , the Captain sailed alongside the other ships and gave the order to furl the sails and drop anchor .
va	4	" Whilst you do not see eye to eye ... " " Fuck ye , Jamison , it 's yer fault I be lacking me eye ! "
va	3	This match went better for Jeff and he ultimately was victorious when he lunged forward and thrust his stick into the other Stevens ' gut .
va	0	As Pike landed flat on his back on the deck , Harrison once again turned towards Graves who had just picked up his practice sword .
va	4	By the time the sun was beginning to set , he was thoroughly exhausted and was bruised , and sore to the point he could barely move .
va	4	Harrison retreated to his bunk for some rest and Jeff headed to the galley for some food and to see his favorite member of the crew .
va	0	Captain Jamison ha ' provided four additional men and if ye can see fit to provide another four , we shall have full strength for the raid .
va	4	As Jeff saw the last man in the line pass by , the man in the trees slipped out onto the path and Jeff quickly followed .
va	1	Jeff began putting on his costume as Craig knelt naked in the sand with his hands and feet bound , staring at him in stony silence .
va	4	Now , as the night grows short , we should get back to the ships and prepare to be underway before the Spanish fleet shows up " .
va	3	Jeff was pretty worn out too , but the adrenaline from the life and death fights of the night before still had him pretty wired .
va	0	Jeff winced as the first crack of the whip resounded with a loud smack against the first man 's back and the man screamed out in pain .
va	3	As the punishments continued , Jeff zoned out for a time , lost in his thoughts about his own violent actions from the night before .
va	3	The fort that Jeff had seen from the ship was an imposing structure with high stone walls that came right to the water 's edge .
va	0	They soon had a large fire burning and although it was some distance away , Jeff could feel the warmth from it on his skin .
te	2	I can barely move , my head feels like it 's going to explode and now you want to sneak off to the grotto ! "
te	4	By now , the sun was peeking over the wall of the fort and most of the celebrants were awake and moving about over at the tables .
te	1	We shall be on a course that takes us the long way around the island , so it is unlikely that our paths will cross .
te	0	He walked down to the galley and as usual , Jenny was busy preparing food and after stealing a quick kiss , she shooed him out .
te	3	Jeff noticed that Jenny was not among the gathered landing party , so there was not going to be a chance for another visit to the cave .
te	3	Jeff watched the crews on all three ships scurrying around to try to get as much speed as possible to try to outrun the Spanish .
te	3	As before , the Captain 's timing was perfect and the shot found its mark -- a direct hit on the shaft of the ship 's rudder .
te	3	Both shots hit their mark , with one splintering the center of the aft mast and the other tearing through sails and rigging further forward .
te	4	Both were barely conscious , fortunately for them , Jeff thought , because the pain from the injuries he was looking at would have been intense .
te	0	Finish up what you are doing and make preparations for yourself and the injured to hold fast as we shall be coming to an abrupt stop . "
te	4	To this end , he remained aboard the Wandering Wench , which anchored well offshore in an attempt to avoid detection by the Jamaican authorities .
te	4	" Well , we could hire a couple of these lovely ladies , or perhaps we could get a room to relax in at the Hotel Royale .
te	0	The mattress appeared to have been filled with a mixture of straw and feathers , providing a surface that was remarkably lumpy and poked at the skin .
te	3	" We need to get back to the ships , " Jenny said as Jeff stood up stiffly and tried to work out the kinks .
te	4	By the time Jeff and Jenny were finished eating , everyone was back on the ship and Captain Jamison gave the order to cast off .
te	1	" Mr. Greene , I have considered your interest in joining the raid , and I think I can accommodate you -- on one condition . "
te	0	Jeff was already waiting at the rail when the Captain gathered the rest of the raiding party and placed Crabtree in command of the ship .
te	4	The three other soldiers in the building were taken completely by surprise and put up no resistance when faced with the multiple pistols aimed at them .
te	4	Jeff tied the sack closed and threw it over his shoulder and only then noticed the first sack of coins was still poured out on the desk .
te	4	The Captain continued , " Mr. Greene , words cannot express how much I have valued you as a friend and as a member of my crew .
te	1	Mr. Crabtree caught us in a kiss , but I told him it was a custom from my time -- right before I kissed him ! "
te	3	" I suspect that to be true , " the Captain said with a chuckle , " That was quick thinking indeed , Mr. Greene .
te	2	The room was empty , except for a few buttons , a mirror , and what looked like some sort of drawers on the walls .
te	3	Out of curiosity , he pushed the button again and after a momentary pause , the sound stopped and the commode slid out from the wall .
te	3	Sitting at the kitchen table , Edwin put down his textbook and ticked the box marked " history " in his homemade revision planner chart .
te	3	I 'm sorry I didn 't have time to check the results at school , but I was stuck in the office all day doing paperwork .
te	4	From their nervous glances and hesitant steps , Edwin suspected the other children shared his misgivings , but Maddy 's mood was more difficult to gauge .
te	2	" It 's bad enough you finished bottom in your exams , " continued Jane , " but this sort of behaviour will only make things worse .
te	4	A line of paintings hung on the passage wall , portraits of people wearing old-fashioned costumes , staring at him with eyes that seemed somehow alive .
te	4	" It 's opening ... " Edwin looked at the wardrobe , and realised Maddy 's shock was not the result of an electric current .
te	2	He claimed he was investigating a cure of boils , but the authorities knew he was up to no good and so closed down his laboratory .
te	3	No , it wasn 't the dark ; it was the thought of being down here on his own that made Edwin 's stomach knot with fear .
te	3	That is why the Wise Ones kept the Tome secure in their library , to stop its power falling into the wrong hands again . "
te	3	I could obtain this from the national grid , but I am a little behind with my monthly bills and I don 't trust direct debits .
te	3	" She was a bright pupil , but lacked concentration , and would rather play tricks on her tutor than commit herself to serious study .
te	4	There was a crackling noise as forks of electricity danced around the metal pole , and the BBC lit up like an oversized fruit machine .
te	3	But Bryony had the monster in her sights , and shot a beam of magic that hurled the gargoyle into the advancing suits of armour .
te	3	After few letters from my Readers I realized that some does not understand this in spite it should be rather obvious that IT IS A STORY .
te	1	He is in fact far from sainthood and even far from accepted common norm as he is determined to think independently and have own opinions .
te	4	All birds , on joining the Bird Seekers Colony , wore a white feather in reverence of their leader and spiritual guide , White Eagle .
te	0	He was so enthusiastic that he was always ready to do any work , at any time , even the work of the sparrows or the ravens .
te	1	Birds ' Family Court already officially divorced them but Woodpecker was involved , almost on a daily basis , with their son Bird Naughty Chick 's affairs .
te	2	Even going back to Birds ' Colony wouldn 't be appropriate , as he was not able to join their chirping chorus of birds ' songs .
te	4	We , we , we ... the Generals always know what to do ... Foreign birds donate generously so there is no problem at all .
te	2	Until now foreign goods had been carefully stored in damp rooms to mature and thus adapt quickly to the local conditions of this tropical climate .
te	4	Luckily for all involved , the Generals appointed a most knowledgeable and technically minded small Goldfinch to be the bird in charge of Woodpecker 's supplies .
te	3	But birds say that time heals all wounds and it is true not only in the normal , mundane but even in the spiritual birds ' world .
te	2	In this way foreign bird Woodpecker was on his way to becoming the first bird ever to run a workshop with a white marble floor !
te	3	It provided a great chance for the local bird carpenters to prove that they could make wood straight again by hand planing through the night .
te	4	When asked when he was going to install windows into Woodpecker 's workshop because the place was flooded when it rained he shouted : " Tomorrow ! "
te	2	Woodpecker photographed this superior scene , choosing as acting heroes most lovely dogs , and sent the photo , as a postcard , to White Eagle .
te	1	Thanks to the still miraculously functioning air conditioning system , all carcinogenic gases and the smell of burning plastic was evenly distributed to all rooms .
te	0	For Big Condor -- S ' Maya , a gigantic cushioned seat was arranged on an elevated stage , like those in movies about ancient King Birds .
te	3	Small Goldfinch , being such , forgot his mastery of the birds ' martial arts and changed position to be at the back of others .
te	1	Woodpecker , being heartless , advised her to pack her possessions and go as soon as possible on a birds ' bus to the Colony Headquarters .
te	1	Woodpecker brushed away his questions and ignoring his genuine interest in finding out what was going on , walked towards the auto rickshaw awaiting him .
te	2	Do not play stupid now as this is beyond the norm of highest bird 's stupidity and does not relieve you from responsibility for your choices .
te	2	But now you say in this nice book , Hellish Heaven , that you cannot be sure one way or the other about all of them .
te	1	I heard that you are living with this low cast bird Fairy Bluebird who is nothing , not even good enough to be my servant .
te	2	Instead , working on starving your own arrogant ego , you concentrated on consolidating power and were lobbying a few to have a team of dedicated supporters .
te	1	Go now , go , and do not waste time again , it is only one week -- not one hundred and thirty five years ! "
te	4	He assessed Bird Alli as completely sober and confirmed that the workers staying in Woodpecker 's workshop were permitted , as he is in charge .
te	3	To give up is the easiest thing any Bird can do , but to continue when most of the other birds are against us is real strength .
te	4	I 'm glad we 've decided to spend the night with her because I know she gets lonely out there on the sheep station . "
te	0	We are both starving , so we leave the airport and head straight for Hanuman , a restaurant known for its Thai and Indian cuisine .
te	3	I mention that our guide talked to the park ranger and said it was nothing to be concerned about , so she seems happy with that explanation .
te	4	" It sounds like dogs yelping and growling at each other , you know , when they are fighting over scraps , " he says .
te	3	All I know is there is something out there , and I don 't want to make its acquaintance in the middle of the night .
te	4	We pile into the car and on our way out of the National Park we see a couple of ambulances on the side of the road .
te	0	" No , I don 't mind at all ; in fact , I 'm just as curious as you are , " Derrick answers .
te	2	Derrick opens the door and asks him if he just knocked , he said , " No , I thought you just knocked on my door .
te	3	Derrick looks back at me and gives me that little boy grin that I love so much , and holds his thumb up to the sky .
te	3	It 's a little hard to tell what it used to be because it looks as if a tornado came through and totally rearranged the contents .
te	2	At the end of the long hall is a big steel door with half a dozen hazardous material suits hanging on the outside of the door .
te	4	" Sorry man , but we knocked , and the door was unlocked , so we walked in to find this mess , " Derrick explains .
te	2	" I 'm sorry but I don 't know you people and what 's going on here is none of your business , " he says sharply .
te	1	If taken in very small doses on a daily basis , it can control anger and aggressiveness not only in humans , but in animals as well .
te	0	He looked around towards the back of the airplane and saw what he called a ' hot rock ' burning a hole through one of the seats .
te	0	I didn 't say anything to Carlos about the blood , because I didn 't want to alarm him in any way since he was already agitated .
te	4	" I 'll give her a call this evening and let her know we will be there bright and early in the morning , " Dane says .
te	3	Trevor thinks that it probably isn 't , because he did not get it from Carlos , but what about a bite or bodily fluid exchange ?
te	1	Dane is going to contact an old friend of his , Monti , and ask him to help us hunt and kill the infected dingoes .
te	1	It is a directive advising people to immediately go indoors if a dingo is sighted , because they are attacking humans for no apparent reason .
te	1	Geoff looks at Dane with surprise and says , " And you don 't mind taking on the burden of hunting and destroying the infected dingoes ? "
te	1	Derrick and I talk in bed for about ten minutes before going to sleep wondering if this is the right thing for us to do .
te	1	" The gun was in my left hand , and my right arm was in front of my face blocking the dingo 's mouth ... damn ! "
te	1	" Listen , Geoff , " Dane says , " we want to head back out in the morning and finish killing the infected dingoes .
te	4	I see Taku 's eyes open and he whispers in a very weak voice , " Cousin , cousin , what are you doing here ? "
te	4	At the car , we start to carefully remove the protective gear and place them in airtight containers to be decontaminated and recycled back at the lab .
te	0	When we arrive at the lab , Dane and Monti take the airtight containers right to the decontamination area and grab four clean biohazard suits .
te	3	I would say , " It hurts when I do that , " and he would say , " Then don 't do that ! "
te	1	When I made the incision on the husband , a reddish black fluid oozed from the incision , but I didn 't think much of it .
te	0	I walk in the lab , give the fluid to Nicola , and ask her if anyone has checked on our patients in quarantine today .
te	2	He holds out his right arm for me to use and says , " Why don 't you let me collect blood samples from the other guys .
te	0	Cole puts his hand up to the glass , and I put my hand up to the glass , smile , and head toward the hazardous area .
te	0	" I am so hungry , I could eat a horse , " Dane says as he flips the box open and grabs a huge sandwich .
te	2	If you look at him from this angle , nose to nose , you can see a faint , white , ring around his nose .
te	0	I did see one yard that had really green grass , but Taylor told me it was a special grass that doesn 't need watering at all .
te	3	Matthew comes into the tent about 20 minutes after starting the fire and pours bleach all over the body while it is in the coffin .
te	1	The tiny lid is removed from the coffin , and inside lying just as peaceful as an angel is this precious little boy with light blond hair .
te	3	Taylor asks Matthew to set up a trailer by the cemetery to store the coffins in until they can be placed back in the ground .
te	0	Taylor and I look at each other and take a deep breath because we know that this is going to be a very long day .
te	4	We are going to have some surveyors confirm that the water here does not tie into any other water system , just to be safe .
te	4	I have it typed and saved on the computer because every time I go to the doctor , they want a current list of medications .
te	3	Sometimes , I stop and listen before I approach the glass , because he is totally into that rat , and the conversation is so cute .
te	2	I saw Derrick knock on the door of the truck and pass the box full of vials to Taylor so he can start analyzing them .
te	2	You look good standing up there with your blue jeans on and that cowboy hat riding low on your forehead , " I say with raised eyebrows .
te	3	" Mrs. Jones , I am going to do is test the water today , just to get an idea of what sort of impurities are present .
te	4	We decide to go up to the house and deliver the news , and let her know we will be returning to Darwin the next morning .
te	2	Do you need us to stay and help you through this , or ... " Before I can finish my question , Taylor shakes his head no .
te	3	I see Henderson fighting with the controls , just trying to hang on to the airplane , but he is having a very difficult time .
te	1	I am lucky to have a button up shirt on today , so I tuck my arm inside my shirt and use it like a make-shift sling .
te	2	" It looks like you have this fire building under control , so Derrick and I are going to hunt for food , " Dane announces .
te	4	We are going to need more wood if we are going to keep the fire burning like that all night , so Henderson starts looking for more .
te	2	My Dad respectfully said no , and explained that in our country , young girls go to school and get an education before they marry .
te	0	It wasn 't the type of safari where you go and shoot wild animals ; it was a pleasure safari just for viewing the wildlife .
te	2	Within a couple of hours , another van came along , got our information , and drove back to the lodge and got us some help .
te	0	My Dad looked at me and told me if I was serious , I would have to find the instructor and an airplane to use .
te	2	" So Dane , I 'm sure you have a story or two about some of your favorite clients , or maybe not so favorite clients .
te	4	Once the tents were set up and the stew was warmed up enough to eat , Charles went to the car and told her dinner was ready .
te	3	She came out of the tent and told her husband , ' Get me out of this dreadful country ' , so they left that afternoon .
te	3	I notice that the fire has almost completely died out , so I throw a couple of logs on top , and it starts to burn again .
te	3	They come back holding what appears to be a big bowl , but it is actually the cone off of the tip of the tail .
te	3	I see the sun starting to dig its way into the earth 's surface and am truly amazed at how beautiful the sunset really is .
te	0	We are probably about two hours from the crash site now , and I ask if we can stop for a few minutes and rest .
te	4	Dane sees it too , because we alter our course just a little bit to the right so we can stop and rest under the trees .
te	3	I know it 's a Joey , and then I see it ; there is a little head sticking out of the top of the pouch .
te	0	After a few minutes , Dane breaks contact and sits down at the small table in the tent and asks me to explain what happened .
te	1	I ask him what is wrong and he says , " I am just imagining how I would feel if it were my own little girl .
te	3	They found it a lot quicker than I thought they would , but with two great minds working around the clock , it was inevitable .
te	1	I am on dialysis , and I have to carry around these bags to get rid of my waste , but my mind is still functioning .
te	1	I didn 't want to bring him in the ICU , so I put him in his cage , which doesn 't happen that often . "
te	1	The facility allows dogs , cats , and other domesticated animals inside the facility , so I thought I would bring him in to brighten her day .
te	3	" Yes I did , but with such nasty bump on his head , he might not be cleared medically to fly by the flight doctors .
te	2	" I knew your Dad was really lonely without you here , so the rat would be good company until he could see you again .
te	3	I have a tub next to the shower and usually put my towels there so when I get out , I don 't have to walk far .
te	3	When you first mentioned moving here , that was the first thing that entered my mind when I thought about what I would do for work here .
te	2	Derrick and Dane you know , but this is Geoff , the CDC Director from Darwin , and Henderson , our pilot and my dear friend . "
te	1	I think Derrick is planning to have a beer with the guys while I am taking my bath , so I will enjoy a bath even longer .
te	2	So , Dane and I walked up toward the front of the store and sat on the floor right in front of the soda cooler .
te	3	We could hear the sirens coming , so we thought this was all going to be over soon , but that 's when things started getting tense .
te	4	She was rocking back and forth crying , ' Please let me go ; I have to get to my little girl , please ! '
te	4	Then , all of a sudden , he reached down and yanked the woman up by her hair and yelled at her to shut up .
te	1	In fact , Derrick and I are planning to move to Darwin in a few months , so we may be seeing you real soon . "
te	3	The airline wants us to arrive two hours prior to departure , which will allow us time to get all the bags checked and go through security .
te	4	" He is , " Cera explained , " he can run faster than anyone else , but he 's got a throwing arm like Jell-O . "
te	1	" Well isn 't this a sight for blind eyes , " Mike exclaimed upon seeing Nate come out into the swiftly vanishing day light .
te	3	Cera scoffed at them , pointing to the orange sky behind her , " what do you think that orange thing in the sky is ?
te	3	" Well , I don 't have any bottles for the bottle rockets , so I just need you to hold onto them until they launch . "
te	3	" That 's my sister out there , don 't you think I want what 's best for her as well as Cady in this situation ?
te	2	" If we 're going to go to the gun store , I suggest we do it soon , " Taylor said , looking at her watch .
te	4	The room they 'd been left in was floor to ceiling concrete , with the exception of a few thin and barred windows near the ceiling .
te	0	Water ran silently through cracks in the walls and coated the floor in a paper-thin layer of moisture , which produced an inescapable and rather pungent odor .
te	1	" You 're being kind of nonchalant about this , " Cady observed her lounging friend and she paced around and kicked up minute amounts of water .
te	2	" Ignore him , " Bobby brought Taylor back up to the front seat conversation , " he 's under a lot of stress . "
te	4	" I left my phone at home before I went to the party , I didn 't think I needed it , " Taylor replied apologetically .
te	4	They had made it a mere ten feet before the truck stopped next to the abandoned car and the two passengers exited , guns drawn .
te	2	" Okay , " Josh broke his recent rule , " I 'm going to ignore for a moment that you just threw a rock at us .
te	3	The alleyway the group had faded into spit them out just a half block from their car , which was now sufficiently empty of smoke .
te	4	" Shut up , " Cera pulled her chair back under the bulb and collapsed down onto it , trying her best to relax her wounded leg .
te	2	" Oh , come on , if you 're not going to some kind of beauty or design school , I 'm going to be shocked . "
te	3	A bullet blew the cigarette right out of Bobby 's mouth and continued past the group to shatter the glass panel on the convenient store door .
te	4	" Look on the bright side , Bob , " Mike patted him on the shoulder , " just be glad you have a car .
te	2	" We 're only looking for one of you , so I suggest they confess or everyone is going to have a terrible night . "
te	3	He reached down and snatched a cement chip in an instant and hurled it thoughtlessly at his intended target , praying he 'd hit it .
te	3	" Watch them for a minute , I 'm putting this in the truck , " he picked up the chainsaw and exited into the garage .
te	0	My car is destroyed , I 'm missing part of my ear and I may have seriously injured my leg jumping out of an abandoned factory . "
te	1	I guess , if I saw something like this in a movie , I 'd laugh , so why shouldn 't I do it now ?
te	3	" But it probably won 't be right away , " he looked at his watch , " it 's a little late for that . "
te	2	" I do have to say , Cady , " Mike turned to her , " you throw one hell of a solstice party . "
te	0	" They might make me retire after this anyway , " she chuckled again , and this time Nate gave a small laugh as well .
te	1	They said I could do it in a way that wouldn 't effect my life immensely , which it didn 't , minus some lack of sleep .
te	3	And , even though the fact that it 's something that Bobby said makes me kinda hate it , I 've got ta love it .
te	3	This was an odd story to write , not to say it wasn 't fun , but it was certainly different from all the others .
te	4	His name was Frank Light and he was the chairman of his university 's department of archaeology , the youngest professor ever appointed to the position .
te	0	The banner , decorated with red and white , orange and black Maryland flags , proclaimed " River Sunday Heritage Day , August 7 . "
te	0	Anchored nearby and surrounded by small fishing boats was a very large and modern white yacht far grander than any other craft in the harbor .
te	4	He started toward Frank , with the confident smile of a man who had complete control of his environment and all the people in it .
te	4	At his request , they put two loaded Navy Colt revolvers in the coffin so the Admiral could keep on shooting Yankees in Hell . "
te	3	" When I was a kid , " he said , " first thing they taught you in school was the words to that song .
te	4	Beside the old bridge , the ramp for the access road raised up , its massive structure of poured concrete and soil fill dwarfing the old structure .
te	0	Flowering vines and corn plants brushed and scraped against the station wagon as Spyder drove hard towards a small farmhouse a few hundred feet ahead .
te	1	In this wilderness , touching Frank 's carefully shined shoes , were a mass of violets mixed with English ivy , their spring blooms long gone .
te	0	Frank , as soon as he figured out what had happened , left Jake behind and walked slowly , almost tiptoeing , towards the man .
te	1	To Frank 's right , towards the old bridge , were several fallen gnarled trees , reaching far out into the river and horribly bent from storms .
te	4	" Whatever her date , early or late , her bowsprit or any bow timbers will be out here beyond the stem that the bulldozer unearthed . "
te	4	Placed on the grid were a series of proposed test pit locations measured out from the datum point marked in the center of the outline .
te	2	" You have to understand that my job here is to look for a ship , not to look for graves of dead slaves . "
te	3	It was a big hole in the ground , a gully , with trees growing down inside it that are at least two hundred years old .
te	1	In the center was a rectangular engine box , its top resting partly open to cool the engine running under it in the bright afternoon heat .
te	3	Then he went to the stern and , watching carefully the drift of the boat , anticipated his best spot and threw out his anchor .
te	1	Frank did not move , trembling slightly with the fear of the unknown , an anxiety he had not felt since long ago nights in Vietnam .
te	4	Its glare was everywhere and glinted off the bits of silica in the soil and the white oyster shells that appeared everywhere as they dug .
te	3	" You folks stand to the side in case the strap lets go You 'll get hurt if it breaks and whips at you . "
te	1	Now , Jake 's hoping his television celebrity status makes up for his father 's death and that loss of the family status around here .
te	4	He did this after he found out they were telling stories that he didn 't like down among their families and cousins in River Sunday .
te	3	The bottler went along with the damn fools but he said they had to buy a lot of cases to keep his inventory cost down .
te	3	So when the rebuilding starts new owners run into the old construction and guys like me come out to see how important the artifacts are . "
te	1	The Pastor interrupted , " I don 't understand how I can see Maggie as a racist if she is just being a good historian .
te	3	I know she will do this job correctly and that she will fight to save anything that is significant , no matter what it is . "
te	4	He 'd get produce of all kinds but the one thing that folks around River Sunday were always good at breeding was good fat chickens . "
te	2	So we set off in the morning , walked all the way out to the island and up to the big house and knocked on the door .
te	3	" Cat might know more than you think , " said the Pastor , staring at the animal and leaning down to stroke its light orange fur .
te	4	Then the smoke , as slight as it was , drifted down on Frank and the others , and mixed a new pungency with the river smell .
te	3	" I 've found that the nature folks care more about the animals and the insects than they do about any people , " said the Pastor .
te	4	You go in there , " Soldado continued , " You 'll come across little pot holes and trails where the muskrats and the other animals live .
te	4	All of the wood below the tide line was covered with the green and brown growths of the thousands of water creatures infesting the hulk .
te	4	We want to do something with the money , something that will free us from working for the people who have always given us orders .
te	4	Many of the white owned businesses in River Sunday had black employees and after a while some of those black employees threw in with us .
te	2	" Your picture was on the bulletin board of my high school for several years , your picture and part of one of your speeches .
te	0	" That was what I said in my acceptance at the award July 17 , 1968 , standing in front of the courthouse in River Sunday .
te	3	A lot of Washington people attended , not many folks from River Sunday , but that was the way it was in those days . "
te	0	The way the man is gripping the hilt shows he was using it as a hammer , not as a weapon , " observed Frank .
te	2	That 's why more soil was added to fill in the cove so the wreck would not show at low tide , " said Maggie .
te	3	The cat came into the light beaming out from the farmhouse kitchen , stopped on the top step to the porch and looked at them .
te	3	The hand was upright , like it was ready to continue guiding the bike , but only a stump of the boy 's arm was still attached .
te	1	As the man moved into position , his legs became buried in the honeysuckle , his body twisting to maintain his balance against the vines .
te	3	We look for something that points to one direction or conclusion and that 's what we finally accept as the story of the site . "
te	2	To do this job right , Jake , to do my job , we have to analyze these bones , find out what we can . "
te	2	If you want to research these bones , you are going to hold up a multimillion dollar project and a lot of local people 's jobs . "
te	2	The old fashioned windows in the mansion house are too hard to see from so I wanted to open up the front side of the house .
te	4	" If they were the bodies of some people who had been killed recently by some serial killer maybe that would stop the bridge construction .
te	0	She went out on a limb and gave me half a day to find what I could , document it , and cover it up .
te	3	This was disappointing to Frank because that was the stern section , the Captain 's area which he had expected to be rich in artifacts .
te	2	His voice was very low , but he pronounced his words carefully , like a man who wants to be known for good speech habits .
te	3	I could tell because there was a little girl right next to him that pulled on his hand to show him which way to walk .
te	1	" The question is , " said Frank , " How do you train the kids , if you don 't carry any banners ? "
te	0	It 's like Vietnam was a great disappointment for a man like you and you don 't want to ever risk that disappointment again . "
te	4	Frank could see the costume from behind , the human underneath who was dressed in a black shirt and trousers with straps holding the wings .
te	4	" With all her concerned heart , " the Pastor said , " That lady doesn 't have any idea about the poor folks here .
te	0	He took her into a small room off his study where he had hung these framed photographs of ducks and butterflies , that kind of thing .
te	2	There is not a one of those photographs here in this old house and anyone wants to see , why they can just come and look . '
te	4	Before anyone could stop him , he had picked one of the skulls out of the soil and placed it up on the edge of the pit .
te	1	" I want a bridge and I want to put a lot of your friends and mine to work building it , " said Jake .
te	2	You don 't want people out seeing the bones anyway so that will solve your problem without your having to pick up all the skeletons .
te	3	They planned to stay behind the rope barrier , away from most of the guests , and to return to archeological work the instant the visitors left .
te	3	" It went on this way for years , " the man said , looking around at the faces to make sure he still had their attention .
te	3	She had two bodyguards who restrained the most aggressive men trying to push against the woman , to touch her , to be part of her body .
te	4	There , Jake 's wife was lying on the ground , her flimsy dress ripped almost off and blood flowing from deep scratches on her thighs .
te	4	In a few moments , there were two skulls , side by side as if they had come to rest in a hug or an embrace .
te	0	This is at an earlier strata , earlier than the soldier , about the same as the giant , the sailors , " said Frank .
te	4	They locked their arms in a square dance twirl and turned themselves around and around until they fell on their sides in the muck , laughing .
te	4	He wrote back with love that same afternoon , scratching a note and putting it in the simple Army envelopes that were there for GI letters home .
te	4	Out on the river a tower of bubbling water rose up from the surface a few feet in front of the bow of the yacht .
te	3	" I was telling your boss that it 's a real hard job to get anything out of the wreck that you can use . "
te	1	" It could have been an accident , " said Frank , as usual speaking as a scientist , trying to consider all sides of the issue .
te	1	" The children had to surrender with their families to some other African , perhaps a debt collector or a conquering warrior from an enemy tribe .
te	4	Perhaps each is given brandy so he or she will smile with a drugged smile and indicate that he or she has a good temperament .
te	0	Out on the river Jake 's yacht began a slow trip back to River Sunday , its lights growing dim as it moved farther away .
te	4	In addition , at the end of the bridge on the island side the lights picked up a pile of small logs barricaded the road .
te	0	Frank heard the chop chop of the machine rushing up the Nanticoke River , its lights flashing first far distant then closer in the night .
te	0	A small fire had been started at the barricade and the flag pole on the church had a race of fire climbing toward the flag .
te	0	He was too far away for Frank to see his face or to do more than guess that it was a man by his heavy build .
te	0	There was the sound of rock songs mixed with country ballads all producing a heavy beat , not a melody just a beat like a huge drum .
te	3	The truck still had its military panel of switches and dials , the stark faces and numbers contrasting with the softness of her hair and face .
te	3	The operator in turn looked at them occasionally as he continued to service the tractor , adding grease to its grease points and its tracks .
te	2	Then the remains of the second floor and roof might topple directly down on the tractor , burying the operator in broken wood and plaster .
te	4	Only his head showed over the trash even though Buddy was forced to stand up on his small driver 's seat in order to see ahead .
te	0	Frank glanced at Buddy 's face a tiny orb above the heavy roll of broken wood and plaster that was tumbling toward the two of them .
te	3	With a movement of his hands , the Pastor directed them to close ranks with the human butterfly group that was spread along the riverbank .
te	0	Jake wiped his face leaving a streak of mud across his forehead , swore , and rushed again at Frank , knocking him off balance .
te	3	The shovel continued and hit the mud , its impact throwing dirt and water through the air , the handle snapping with a loud crack .
te	0	Soldado was startling , tall , angry , with yellow , white and black paint on his bare skin , a red cape across his shoulder .
te	0	A large thigh bone , likely a part of the strange ancient giant , was protruding from Jake 's chest , blood gurgling at its browned base .
te	3	" This morning we heard that there is interest in forming a local group to operate this site as a monument , " said the Pastor .
te	0	He had a mansion located on the Thames River and a country estate in Kent as well as his own ship , the Adam and Eve .
te	4	Old timers said with authority that the only time more people had shown up on the streets was when General Eisenhower came through looking for votes .
te	1	Jake 's white yacht , its bow showing scar marks from the explosion , pitched with the waves , rising and falling without purpose or direction .
te	1	The author of The Wizard hadn 't given a time period when Toni 's wish would come true , but it plainly said it would in time .
te	2	Do you think we should wait to see if our wishes come true or should we walk over to the mall and buy our Prom dresses ?
te	4	" That 's exactly what we would like to find out Toni , " brought the response from Tessie preceding a deep sigh of relief .
te	4	They thought it might be fun to meet in their old stomping grounds since their parents both remained at their respective homes in which they grew up .
te	3	' Wizard I wish to venture with you into the unknown ; to visit the parallel universes that hold the existence of dual worlds . '
te	3	" My hunch is that we 're imagining things Toni , but nonetheless , take a look at that painting of your Willow Tree on the wall ?
te	0	I think I 'm going to lose my ... " She said as she ran to the bathroom and saw an old fashion toilet and screamed .
te	3	" Something happened to Tess and me , but , no , it 's a long story ; one that we will tell you later . "
te	3	One morning Toni had just gotten out of a meeting with some oil specialist and a group of men that discussed a new product in the business .
te	4	She readily accepted and once settled at their table sipping on wine , he asked her if she had ever experienced any near death experiences .
te	1	" I don 't think I wish to discuss this subject any further , " he said unwillingly , " I just asked on an impulse . "
te	2	Later , when I saw you exiting the room a power overtook me and I had to approach you to invite you for this drink and dinner .
te	4	No structures resembled commonly known buildings and these were made of materials foreign to her existed ; this included the structure where she found herself hiding .
te	3	Each in turn tried to tell their story of what brought them to this strange weird place , but neither could come up with any answers .
te	1	One of the destination charts indicated train numbers and locations , and sure enough there was one bound for Berkley ; it was train 74 .
te	4	She twisted her foot over the other one in a defiant stance and stood waiting until he decided it was time for him to finally speak .
te	2	Toni stormed toward her office door and when she stood in front of it , she turned around and saw that the man was gone .
te	4	Several hours later , after Toni had finished telling her story about all the happenings she asked Bob if he thought she was losing her mind .
te	4	Perhaps we need to find it and read it again very carefully to discover exactly what your commitment was to the wish you made . "
te	4	He said as he pulled into the driveway , turned off the motor , looked at her with asking eyes and then opened his door .
te	4	" Oh , hell , Tess did that creep follow us before and is now parked in front of my mother 's house , " exclaimed Toni .
te	1	He looked in his rear view mirror and said to Tessie , " I wish you could stay with Toni for a week , Tess . "
te	2	He did not answer and she looked up at him and reached half timidly for his hand , and said , " Come inside Honey .
te	1	When he nodded and said it was in real life , Toni moaned and said , " What in the hell is going on , Bob ?
te	2	But one can 't cry over spilt milk , but instead they had to progress forward and work to come to some resolution to find a solution .
te	4	" All I know is that I am very confused by the complexity of the words and how they were woven and interspersed throughout the text .
te	3	Each took a turn in explaining their findings , and although most were confusing , they did settle on some things they thought might be relevant .
te	3	It seems that the term that came up many times ; ' The Ju Ju Man ' denoted the center of all this black magic .
te	4	We at the FBI office never know how they will react for they are always in fear that we will invade their territory and give them trouble .
te	2	She was not the sort of lady you would want to introduce to your close friends ; that is unless you wanted to scare them off .
te	4	He also saw no way to signal Toni or Tessie that he was in danger so they were probably going to be subjected to the same routine .
te	4	Bob was unable to speak because he had an object stuck in his mouth and secured behind his neck so that his voice was inaudible .
te	3	Assuring her that they just wanted to get out of there , out of Florida , and return as fast as possible back to California .
te	2	They found themselves in a downtown section of Miami , all tidy and neat so as not to arouse suspicion and led out of the van .
te	1	Her round brown eyes were sparkling happily and her hair was no longer a grayish white , but her warm brown hair with red highlights in it .
te	4	Variations such as these arise because different folks have different reasons to work such a spell and because the conditions they are working under may differ .
te	4	She also held some dark secrets that could wreak havoc on anyone who happened to get in her way or cross her path in the wrong direction .
te	4	" Here 's my business card , in case you would like to get together for a drink , coffee , wine , dinner ? "
te	2	She chuckled and mumbled to herself , I did look at the candle last night and wished upon a handsome man coming to my door .
te	1	All of a sudden whoever was at the door started pounding on it until Bob couldn 't stand it any longer and got up and opened it .
te	3	He yelled out to them to not light the candle and that if they did they must put it out " What 's this all about ? "
te	2	Willy 's body all but jumped off the ground , and more abruptly did it begin than it ended , and his body settled down .
te	1	She was in the bathroom brushing her hair when Toni leaned against the opened door and said , " Do you know a Dennis Mays ? "
te	4	I believe he is directly under your care in the intensive care unit and I have been communicating with Dr. Mitchell since he was brought into Memorial .
te	3	His captivity must have affected him more than we thought ; that 's why I had to call and get your thoughts " cried Toni .
te	3	Let me think about this after having a glass of wine to calm down , and I will get back to you , " promised Tessie .
te	1	She was bothered about the inquiry about her visiting Miami , and although he didn 't come right out and say so , the implication was clear .
te	4	Toni moved over to Bob 's bed and noticed that all tubes had been removed and he seemed to be in a more restful state .
te	4	Was it really on purpose or was he sworn to secrecy as to what his obligations were with the CIA ; that remained the unanswered question ?
te	4	Plus , I will have to bring in four other people to help , for it will take seven of us for my séance . "
te	3	The other two sat in between Tessie and Willy so that there was Willy and two others on his left and two on his right .
te	1	As he was adrift in this strange sea he noticed a person along with him who appeared to be directing this craft in a specific direction .
te	4	Meanwhile , a special agent , posing as a limping wealthy visitor from Europe who was in immediate need of some counseling was the ' plant . '
te	2	The agents made special note to arouse the neighborhood as to what was happening so as to dissuade others from trying to move in on the operation .
te	2	We both know who poisoned mother , but you won 't ... " " Celle I don 't want to hear another word about your sister .
te	3	For reasons I kind of understand now though didn 't at the time I had what turned out to be a sink or swim type of training .
te	4	Startled out of her thoughts the old lady replied , " Sorry my bird , it 's my age you see " she chuckled to herself .
te	2	Pictures of Iron Age and Bronze Age metalwork from Dads books flashed into my mind for they also had patterns similar to the one on the discs .
te	4	There is much you need to know , but time is short , I hope we will meet again Sarah Tremayne so I can tell you more .
te	1	I know so much more than I did then and I often wonder if I knew then what I know now would I have taken the amulet ?
te	4	Shaking her head to clear the fog , Sarah concentrated on the words and then like a light switch being turned on , the words become clear .
te	3	Apart from all the pointy things that had Sarah licking her lips nervously the item which caught her attention was the buckle on his belt .
te	4	Confusion and sheer fright fought with each other but eventually the effort of keeping up with the giant Ulf removed all thought from her mind .
te	2	Dad 's going to think I 've run away again , he 'll send me back to Cornwall or worse , that snot nosed school !
te	4	There were lots of questions Astrid had for Ulf , like why didn 't he go home or why didn 't he take a wife ?
te	0	The roof was thatched and had a hole above the fire pit presumably to draw the smoke away , which Sarah realised was not particularly effective .
te	0	One was covered in furs and had curtains that could be drawn at night and she assumed that this was where Astrid and her husband slept .
te	2	" Ahh , Astrid , please I don 't want to offend you but would you mind terribly if I kept my own boots on ? "
te	0	Said Astrid in a tone of voice that Sarah had often heard from her Nan and it was one with which you did not argue .
te	4	At this point the amulet , so carefully hidden under her dress began to warm and feeling her spine stiffening she looked the headman in the eye .
te	2	It would not be until then that the boys would eat their morning meal as most people would do a couple of hours work before eating .
te	1	The song caught Sarah 's attention and she felt the hairs on the back her neck stand on end and goose bumps ran down her limbs .
te	3	Treat her well and when you think that all is lost then know that it is not , for she will be your salvation . "
te	3	The right hand of the tallest one kept going to his side only to find that the scabbard which usually hung there , now was not .
te	3	It has come to the King 's attention that several lords to the north have banded together and wish to make themselves a kingdom of their own .
te	0	Rolling over onto his back , Sarah realized that Ulf was laughing or trying to laugh as he hadn 't quite got his breath back .
te	2	In a rush of cool air the doors to the hall burst open and a dozen warriors rushed in quickly subduing the only men , Ulf included .
te	4	" Right , I want all the men over there and the women and children on the other side , kill any who resist " .
te	3	Turning to him , Sarah gave him a punch in the arm that almost sent him toppling over the body , " You bloody scared me !
te	0	Figuring she didn 't have a lot of time , Sarah then jumped up and sat on his back taking a handful of hair and pulled .
te	4	" Come on then , we had better tell mother " said Leif , who had been quiet throughout this little exchange , turning away .
te	0	" Ok , can you hazard a guess as to where they might make landfall , or what market they might take the children to ? "
te	0	One appeared to be a snake twisting around a sword , the hilt of which had runes inscribed on it that Sarah was unable to read .
te	1	Listening to the voices she felt a similar sensation to the one when she first arrived into this Viking world and Ulf was talking to her .
te	2	Once paid you can all return to your stinking swamp of a homeland ... except you , " he pointed to the warrior who had complained .
te	0	Her hand went through Harald 's shoulder , she was at best a ghost to him , a ghost he could not see , or could he ?
te	4	Settling herself Sarah took out the amulet and this time just holding it in her hand , closing her eyes she imagines the children on the warship .
te	3	It was then that they all realised that the shout wasn 't about them but part of the normal sounds of the little community waking .
te	0	Looking around Sarah realised that they had skirted past the spot where they had landed last night and were a bit further around the bay .
te	3	Just thought we should make an effort at blending in , our boat would stand out less if it was beached with other similar ones . "
te	0	Sounds of hammering and sawing reached Sarah 's ears , as did all the usual sounds of village life that she had become used to .
te	0	" Now I feel that I could face an army and win -- it is very hard to remain positive on an empty stomach ! "
te	4	Without a glance in their direction snake arms moved beyond their view and none of the children gave any indication that the trio had been seen .
te	0	Sarah realised that neither he nor Leif had understood a word that had been said , they had been talking in Olaf 's native language .
te	2	" Put your weapons away and come , I have found you a good place , it is just around the side here , very rotten wood .
te	2	Your goddess is much older and though not of this land , you could ask her for help but you do not , why ? "
te	0	The knives sank into the dark waves and for a moment Sarah could have sworn she saw a pair of aquamarine eyes staring back at her .
te	4	Sarah was certain that the events of the past few days hadn 't properly really sunk in ; otherwise she wouldn 't be sitting here so relaxed .
te	4	Relief flooded through Sarah as she hastened to do as Leif had asked ; it would be nice to hand over responsibility to an adult .
te	0	Sarah turned and saw a short jetty to one side of a narrow bay , at the head of which a cluster of buildings was visible .
te	4	Walking over to a cluster of women she offered to help and was put to work with an older woman making the bread for the evening meal .
te	3	Questions tumbled through her mind , but the warm stone at her back and the sunshine on her face soon put a stop to the questions .
te	3	Other Titles Cornwall in Prehistory 2005 Tempus ( print only ) -- a basic introduction to the archaeology of this fascinating county in the UK .
te	0	All that had happened is that I 'd spooked a maths teacher with a knife given to me by a loony looking for a horse .
te	1	' I know this is a bad time , ' said the social worker , ' and I have come up with a temporary solution .
te	0	Mr Watkins , suddenly started talking about all the things we could have , as if we were sitting in a travel agent 's buying a holiday .
te	2	He said he could get mourners along to lend dignity and gravitas to the procession and that he thought a lot of people would want to come .
te	0	I had my new black school trousers on , my black blazer ( minus the school badge ) and a black shirt with a black tie .
te	3	I stepped out onto the street in front of the church and stood at the street corner , the junction of Bush Street and Charlton Place .
te	4	Something changed in Sally , almost as if a switch had been flicked : she became serious and old like a teacher or my Mum .
te	4	Slowly , when they don 't come back , you start to realise that they 're gone , that they really are never coming back .
te	0	There was a picture of a man with a pair of binoculars around his neck , holding a kite , standing in front of a castle .
te	0	I tried to tell her that this wasn 't necessary because all that happened was me and Andrew sat at the table and he talked about surfing .
te	0	' The last I heard from him he was working for a woman called Sally , ' added Spartan in a throwaway kind of way .
te	0	I took one last look at Alexi as he stood by the door tapping the meat cleaver in his hand , sweat running off his bald head .
te	2	From my open doorway I saw him park on the side of a lane , open a gate and stroll into his field of cows .
te	4	I tried to figure out what Dad would have done : sleep , probably , he was a very chilled sort of guy , my Dad .
te	3	' Don 't just stand there , boy , ' said Sally , kicking off her boots , at the threshold : ' Come in . '
te	3	I didn 't want Sally to think I wasn 't surfing so I made sure I stuck it out on the beach for a long time .
te	2	' You can work with Preston today , Clint , we 'll find out if you 're as useful as you pretend to be . '
te	2	Basically he was too big , too wide , too long in the neck and too short in the leg to win a real race .
te	0	I can still feel the sea air blast out all that hay , horse dung and saddle soap that seemed to cling to our skin .
te	3	Preston went into the house for a bath and a long sleep in front of the old telly that Sally kept in the big living room .
te	4	In the evenings the three of us would eat together and then I 'd go to bed in my room at the top of the house .
te	3	Things went on like this for a couple of weeks and , although I didn 't know it at the time , I was happy .
te	4	' Found her on the side of the road , ' said Sally , hiding her head in the hole where the ash comes out .
te	4	I suppose the kid didn 't realise we 'd trained the horse to go for the line and he was standing right in front of it .
te	3	I could just about make the shapes of the kids shambling onto the beach from a white minibus right at the top of the beach .
te	1	' Missile , ' I said , in my happiest voice , without showing my face , then I stood up so that he could see me .
te	0	I mean how do you run away straight to the thing you 're actually really supposed to be running away from in the first place ?
te	3	Slowly I picked up what to do with my feet in the stirrups , what to do with reins : how to turn , how to stop .
te	3	Missile felt more like a motorbike : 1000cc with fat tyres , so fast that it leaves your guts behind when you open the throttle up .
te	4	It was just that Missile was so big I could see over the hedges and right down to the beach -- and he felt strong .
te	1	And I 'd found something out : I was good at it -- riding horses -- or at least , riding one special horse , Missile .
te	3	I used to talk to him all the time and we 'd ride up and down that beach so fast that I thought we were flying .
te	2	There were old tools for the farm , a pile of house coal , sacks of potatoes and a couple of rusty old sun loungers .
te	3	But the amazing thing was , almost as soon as Sally pulled the gun and shut us in the dark , Dexter started to talk properly .
te	3	Almost getting flattened by Missile didn 't do Preston any good , but it put some fast talking into Dexter 's mouth for the very first time .
te	0	He had a fight with some Barcelona fans , he bought pizzas for his team at halftime and he did an interview on Spanish television .
te	3	After parading around in the paddock in front of the crowd it was time for me to ride out with the others to the starting gates .
te	2	' You took my knife , boy , ' shouted Spartan , before turning into the crowd and forcing his way back towards the car park .
te	1	I shoved through the crowds of punters , desperately searching for one big , stand-out lighthouse with two small , but highly distinctive prisoners in his hands .
te	4	The noise of the crowd in the grandstand , the pounding of the hooves and Preston 's deaf old ears would never have picked up my cries .
te	2	He stood to his full height and drew one of his short swords , and I wondered if we were going to throw down right there .
te	4	He had a latticework of scars up his left arm ; he 'd told me that he cut a new one for every life that he took .
te	3	Africa had its share of problems , though with more people living a little closer to the old traditions they at least had a fighting chance .
te	1	Still , I wanted to be living cannon fodder when everything was finished , so slung my axe up onto my shoulder and hurried to join them .
te	4	He 's got a bunch of people in there and he 's supposed to be taking charge of a lot of the tribes , consolidating power .
te	3	We all knew what he meant ; the government was just as out of date as the map but no one wanted to admit it .
te	3	If we 're real lucky we might get a shot at the bounty on him , but I 'm not sure that 'll happen . "
te	0	A Hag bore down on me , screaming like a mountain lion caught in a wood chipper , and I abruptly had my hands full .
te	3	I struggled to my feet and looked for my axe , noticing along the way that Raine and Birgitte had taken care of the first Hag .
te	3	I added a few punctuating arguments with my shotgun , glad to get a chance to use the damn thing , and we headed up the stairs .
te	3	Birgitte and I are going to see if we can do something about our scent trail , and then we 've got first watch . "
te	4	Ethan looked back and forth between them and settled his gaze on the mother , who looked a little more together than she had before .
te	3	I couldn 't hear much of what was going on out there thanks to the distance and the way that Virgil was shrieking for his mother .
te	3	The big man didn 't argue , just unclipped one of his hammers and slid it to me through a gap in the grate that separated us .
te	2	He looked like a trick of robotics , every round hitting something either fatal or painful enough to draw a wolf 's attention away from us .
te	0	I stayed as far from Birgitte as possible , taking heart in the fact that she was ignoring me now that Ethan had snarled at her .
te	0	Everything smelled of papery scales , indicating that this was a Naga passageway , and we moved as quickly as we could to avoid them .
te	1	I didn 't want to fight her if I could help it ; the memory of her fighting the Goblins was still fresh in my mind .
te	3	From time to time we 'd go out and pull in more wood to rebuild the fires , but that was the extent of the excitement .
te	0	I looked back and saw Baran facing away from me , a bloom of flame ten feet high and twenty feet wide pouring from his face .
te	4	The bartender had his hands below the bar ; if I knew anything about places like this , he had them on a weapon of some kind .
te	4	The alcohol content was high enough that my taste buds simply crisped and died , expiring before they could send messages of bleak horror to my brain .
te	3	I started out trying to do one of the Cyclops way of life , but it turns out that they like trying to kill and eat documentarians .
te	2	" It would be a true shame for the local gangs to hear about how much wealth you carry on your person , friend Ward .
te	1	I was just imagining him running around in a circle with his ridiculous shirt engulfed in flames when Virgil said , " What 's that ? "
te	3	He went back out into the tavern and returned with a pair of bottles that proved to be drastically better beer than what was on tap .
te	1	Finally I said , " You 're welcome to stay the night with us if you don 't mind sleeping in a chair or something . "
te	1	I kept dreaming of Birgitte slashing at me with her slim blade ; each time , I 'd start and find myself staring at the ceiling .
te	2	He followed the hammer blow with a couple of shots from his pistol , one of which struck me in the same shoulder and knocked me down .
te	2	My axe was a wonderful weapon but it took space to swing and I was too crowded in the cluttered common room to use it effectively .
te	4	It was made harder by Virgil 's sudden squirming and shrieking as he tried to get out of my arms to get to his fallen mother .
te	4	By the time we stopped , we couldn 't see the walls of the stronghold anymore ; they were hidden behind layers of fallen buildings .
te	0	Basically a needle was inserted into my throat to create an airway directly into my trachea , bypassing my swollen nostrils , so I could breathe .
te	4	The doctor came in and looked me over commenting on my lack of facial features and deformations as if I were on some other planet .
te	1	The brain 's ability to form new synapses and connective pathways diminishes and unless you have a serious injury , you 're stuck with what you have .
te	3	Adults , my mother and father for example , don 't seem to have the flexibility in thinking that the youth of the world possess .
te	3	We could take in whatever bits of each other 's minds that seemed important or we could discard it for the white noise that it was .
te	1	The flicker was like an electrical short and at times it was as if I could hear a buzzing when it would do its thing .
te	2	" If you just touch his face , " my mother was saying , " then you 'll be able to read his mind too .
te	4	He jogged to a respectable distance , working his arm in an arc with the football in his hand , and then turned and yelled .
te	2	My mother was standing on the stoop to the front door watching , one arm wrapped across her stomach and the other up by her face .
te	1	I didn 't have my pocket computer with me because I didn 't want to risk breaking it , so I couldn 't communicate with him .
te	1	She had a puzzled sound to her voice and I could see she was curious as to why this strange boy was asking for me by name .
te	2	You know , that mom look they 're so good at when you 're a kid and no amount of words or thoughts can equal it .
te	0	I found a way up onto the tree anyway and cautiously made my way out over the water , but I was on my feet .
te	3	I wanted to ask him if he ever fell in , but I didn 't want to risk typing into my pocket computer at the moment .
te	1	A burst of tingling erupted at my fingertips and it was as if I could see something discharge from them , but it was probably my imagination .
te	2	My mom , who was all about her old way of life , even after fourteen years of this , stood and introduced Kaylin to Joey .
te	3	At the time , I wasn 't exactly sure how she did it , but I knew what I saw when she was doing it .
te	3	Tuck didn 't want to leave the puppies , but he stood and we walked through the woods to the log that crossed the creek .
te	3	It struck the gun in his hand and knocked it to the ground just as Sadie jumped to his chest and went for his throat .
te	2	Sadie backed off now , a growl low in her throat as I was able to get through to her and tell her to stop .
te	3	A little boy ran up to them and the ones closest to him took flight and then settled back to the rail in a different spot .
te	1	I think she was going to scold us , but saw my face , and like most , paused , not sure what to do .
te	1	While Joey flirted with Susan , I told him I was going to the chimps and he waved his hand at me dismissing me without a glance .
te	3	I just had this feeling that it was what she needed , but it was more of an unconscious thing now that I look back on it .
te	3	At the zoo , the ticket seller didn 't want to let us in with the dog , but Joey insisted that we be allowed .
te	3	I just didn 't trust my own thoughts and I really didn 't want them to see how bleak and dark things were growing inside of me .
te	2	Closer to an animal than any human should be , yet further from one too , for no animal could do what this man had done .
te	0	They don 't have ' things ' on their mind , " she said , back in the kitchen with her drink in her hand .
te	2	I could see a bright spot of color on her face and though her hand flitted around it I could tell it was a bruise .
te	3	It was a nice tight spiral but it didn 't have the power of mine and we had to slow up to meet the ball .
te	4	Most of the boys were older than Tuck and me by a year or two , but I recognized some of the faces from my classes .
te	4	I could see Rodney and Andy , the grins wiped off of their faces , and Paul shifting his weight from one foot to the next .
te	0	I didn 't know where I was or what was happening and my heart started to pound in my chest as the panic spread through me .
te	3	They didn 't stay long when they realized that I couldn 't remember a thing and left with nothing new to add to the case .
te	3	I held her hand and concentrated , brief glimpses of the past , but nothing that meant anything , or nothing as dramatic as my sight returning .
te	0	I wore the mask , my face itchy and hot , but I also had a hoody on that I had pulled over my head .
te	1	Kind of like looking through the slits cut out in a Halloween costume , a kind of tunnel vision that made you miss things in your periphery .
te	3	I sat next to the kid who had told me it was cool that I could hear the animals and typed him a question about Herman .
te	0	Cake and presents and all that frilly stuff moms liked to do were planned and Avril was more than happy to be in on it .
te	0	" Thanks , " Joey said , sarcastically , and walked over to where Avril , my mom and I sat on the curb with the dogs .
te	1	Joey was still with us , his job giving him steady hours , and Susan , the zookeeper , was a common sight at our house .
te	3	On the day of Bret 's return , I was outside with Tuck and we were working on getting my throwing arm back into shape .
te	4	At the elephants ' enclosure , Reggie and Tammy trumpeted a greeting to us and came over to the edge and put their trunks through the gaps .
te	0	Maria 's snout broke the surface of the water again and she nodded her head up and down rapidly making clicking noises and a few whistles .
te	4	She was close to giving up all she was and succumbing to her grief , and what little energy she had she was expending on me .
te	4	I think she was meant for me , and we had been lucky enough to find each other in the vast darkness that was this world .
te	0	A part of you that 's now in me and no matter what , I 'll always carry that part of you around inside . "
te	3	Concentrating my thoughts on each little trinket or object , I could levitate each around the room and elevate my thoughts to things that made sense .
te	2	I motioned for all of us to move out of range of Maria and we went to the other end of the sick bay and talked .
te	3	Dr. Eva called Susan to talk with her , but the conversation didn 't last long with both women breaking down and promising to keep fighting .
te	0	Some of the rooms had lab equipment and chemicals and one room had an incinerator that Susan claimed was used for cremation of animal remains .
te	3	It was still warm to the touch and Joey looked at us all like this was going to be a bust before it even started .
te	1	" I 'm going to jail for breaking and entering , and we 're not even going to find any dolphins in here , " Joey said .
te	3	Susan told Joey to pull the truck around to the back entrance and then they would take a small internal road to the sick bay .
te	1	I took over and rolled the sling lift back into its place , the muscles in my back working , but nothing like the dolphin .
te	0	It had been a good day , and even though I had pain with the long ball , I now knew that I could do it .
te	2	The locker I was looking for was dark in color , but I since I saw in shades of gray , I had no idea what color .
te	2	A young man took us around and showed us the equipment , weights , and indoor pool , but we were anxious to see the locker rooms .
te	3	The final place was a little ways further south on Blanding and we pulled into the packed parking lot and stepped out into the heat .
te	4	I have all kinds of people come in here day after day with problems that they want me to solve or lost loves they need to find .
te	1	The black , oily stench of him seeped into my nostrils and filled my head with visions of death and things I couldn 't banish .
te	1	I reacted with brilliant speed and flung his body across the room , the gun sailing out of his hand through a window and into the night .
te	0	Just a pain that wouldn 't leave me , an ache that racked my body with the shakes and made my nose drip and run .
te	4	When they realized it was a bad dream , they left me with her and I held her until her shaking stopped and she fell back asleep .
te	4	When Joey pulled the wheelchair from the trunk , tears began to fall from her eyes and I went to her and picked her up .
te	3	The center , for purposes of the tryout , would hike the ball on the third audible , but of course I couldn 't talk .
te	0	I let the ball sail , the familiar pain shooting into my arm as the ball shot skyward , a nice tight spiral that looked dead on .
te	3	It was a thing that I wasn 't sure I understood , but I tried to explain it to her the way I thought it happened .
te	3	What they didn 't know was the rooms they put us both in were right next to each other and Avril and I could still talk .
te	4	An older couple came in , the woman in tears , and they both stared at Avril and me as if we were the enemy .
te	1	I found a bloody baseball bat leaning up against my locker and I picked it up in my hands , touching the red liquid on the wood .
te	1	As I ran , the jarring of it caused Pepper so much pain , I switched to lifting her with my telekinesis and carrying her that way .
te	4	Everybody would come up and look her up and down and either give her a big hug or congratulate her on being out of the chair .
te	4	The two guys looked nervous now , and their eyes flicked back and forth between Coach Danforth , me , and the team behind us .
te	1	I didn 't know if I could get to them both , but the energy was building in my back and I could feel its power .
te	3	Detective Tate was pulling his hair out , but the District Attorney 's office would not push it to the grand jury for lack of real evidence .
te	4	Coleen Dyson was smiling with the sun behind her and the wind blowing her hair as she rode in the passenger seat of a car .
te	4	They had a receiver on their team who our corners couldn 't seem to cover and he was beating us on just about every play .
te	4	The refs all huddled and must have decided that there was nothing they could do about me and no rule was being broken that they could determine .
te	4	She found a part time job at the zoo , Susan helping her there , and I would be joining her in a couple of months .
te	3	At the mall , we ran in to some kids from school and they hung out with us as we all waited for the movie to start .
te	4	Her aura was something I 'd never seen before , a brilliant dark red with an edge of orange that flickered along the outline of it .
te	4	She opened to me , as if I had allowed her to touch my face , and she poured into me before I could think .
te	1	A bright crimson life that spoke of fun and danger , joy and thrills , and I saw a kind of person who could never be boring .
te	4	She closed the door and stood there , thoughts racing through her head in a blur and I knew she was not going to be gentle .
te	4	I was getting more comfortable behind the center and though the home team protested my playing , the referees assured them that I was legal .
te	0	After all this time , it had grown weak and atrophied , like a paraplegic 's legs and I had no idea if it could be restored .
te	4	I know it didn 't make for an ideal way to communicate , but the telepathy had been the reason he left in the first place .
te	0	After a brief yelling fit , ( Mom actually looked as if she was having a fit ) she allowed him to stay and see his children .
te	2	Avril and Sydney were becoming very close and though uncomfortable for me at times , it was good to have them both around so much .
te	3	I didn 't like what that look meant and I stood up , Avril right next to me , and we went over to him .
te	4	We were all going to the dance on Saturday together , including Sydney 's date , Kyle Ansel , the senior quarterback who had injured his shoulder .
te	4	He resigned from his job in disgrace and after her trial and conviction , he moved away to some place only a handful of people knew .
te	2	I was the hero who stopped a crazed kid and I led the football team to a big victory over one of our most feared rivals .
te	4	She and I would be forever bonded and the feelings I had when I was with her ruled my life and made it all good .
te	0	Dad was not welcome , but he made it known that he was here to stay and would show us all that he was a different guy .
te	0	She stood up quickly , as if they had been caught in the act and he wiped his face with the back of his hand .
te	0	Sydney 's grades were not up to par for a scholarship , but her dad could afford to pay her tuition and she was already accepted .
te	0	He was hard for me to pick out , his aura a darkened eggplant color that faded into a grayness that made him part of the background .
te	2	One that he really didn 't know how to get out of and the blackness had taken hold of him and would not let go .
te	2	I watched her color slip from orange to black to gray and I felt her leave this world in a rush of wonder and questions .
te	2	Joey lay in a pool of his own blood , his fingers covering the wound on his belly as the dark fluid leaked around his fingers .
te	2	An hour later , a doctor found us in the waiting room and told us Joey was in recovery and doing as well as could be expected .
te	1	Avril , Tuck , Sydney and I pushed his door open slowly and found him sleeping in his bed , wires and tubes running out of him .
te	4	Two men , huge in comparison to Joey , stepped from behind a dumpster and proceeded to beat him to within an inch of his life .
te	0	His shame was a thing we could all see , the aura around him that awful black fractured mess that seemed to short-circuit around him .
te	4	Her father had bought her and Avril queen sized beds and small desks so that each would have a place to study without interfering with the other .
te	3	That first night was like a party as we sat up and talked in their room late into the night despite the fact we all had school .
te	4	I watched him on the third day as he slipped behind a building and talked to himself when his advances only resulted in her scorn .
te	0	We ran from the parking lot to the ER and found Kaylin and Mom pacing by a large aquarium meant to add tranquility to the environment .
te	3	Tuck was gloomy , not because of my dad , but the conflict that tore at him inside about whether I should play or not .
te	1	I picked up his hand in mine and brought it to my face , my mother watching and questioning me in her head and then she understood .
te	3	The road changed to dirt and ruts and I saw that Bret 's car was slowing , losing its traction with the speed it was carrying .
te	1	Bret crept into my head then , a slithering snake of a voice , dripping with anger and sarcasm , pulling my vision back to him .
te	1	I saw Bret 's lifeless body in my hands , Paul 's unmoving hanging from his belt , and I dropped Bret to the ground .
te	4	We drove to my house in silence , but the anguish I felt inside at what I had done tore at me like razors across my skin .
te	0	I sat up in my bed , unsure of my surroundings , and when reality dawned again , I collapsed against my pillow and hated myself .
te	0	The coach had assumed I was spending time with the family , unaware of what really went on , and Tuck kept it all to himself .
te	3	Tucker hated me from a distance for most of the day , but at practice it was necessary for us to work together as a team .
te	2	He had lost his whole family and the love of his life at one point too and it hurt too close for him to bring it up .
te	4	I reminded him of Tuck 's and my connection , the telepathy , and suggested that he and the whole offense connect with me immediately .
te	4	The crowd gasped , and I could see some of the defensive players gawking as they stopped in their tracks , staring at their downed linebackers .
te	3	Don 't worry , the next Book in the Blank Serial , BLANK : THREADS , will be hitting the stores February 20th , 2015 .
te	3	I 'm just Blank , the idiot who lived a tortured life , torn between what I feel is good and what I don 't .
te	3	The two kids turned fully to me and now the second one had a gun out too and they both pointed the barrels at my chest .
te	0	A guy approached cautiously , the manager , and glanced back and forth between the two of us , but didn 't move any closer .

te	1	I live in a small apartment in Bartow , Florida , where I spend most of my time writing and drinking way too much black coffee .
te	2	" I 'll try not to be too long , but I can 't make any promises , " he said as he opened the front door .
te	4	As Lucas neared the royal city of Cymbeline , he observed in the distance what appeared to be a group of imps in the road .
te	1	Soon after arriving in northern Cymbeline , Lucas found a building with a brown roof and a sign that read " Roshan 's Café . "
te	3	Turning his head away from the stranger , Lucas sat and waited as the constantly shifting emotions of the city continued to churn inside him .
te	1	" Sorry , " Roshan began as he shut the door behind him , securing several locks , " but I cannot risk anyone knowing about this .
te	4	When united with the other fragment it becomes a key to The Temple of Damiano , a structure containing a source of raw , limitless power .
te	0	It was most intriguing , appearing as though the entire landscape had been drawn by a large pen with white ink on a black canvas .
te	1	Still he continued to push himself , focusing on each individual step as the bitter chill cut into his skin like millions of microscopic icicles .
te	1	Through his blurry vision , Lucas saw the creature writhing in agony , producing another loud screech as it was hit with a speeding orb of fire .
te	4	Though he was relieved to be able to move a little more than before , Lucas was still upset that Iris considered him to be delusional .
te	1	From what I understand , this object that was brought to you is the missing fragment of Damiano 's Disk , currently in Spade possession .
te	0	Chapter 6 : Learning The Art Lucas sat quietly on the couch reading The Basics of Light Magic as Iris and Hagan chatted in the kitchen .
te	3	As she dug through it , she said , " I believe you might be getting in a little over your head with that particular book .
te	4	Centers from past relatives float outside of the person 's true center and while these elements are present , the mage does not have access to them .
te	3	At the bottom of the list was written , " Elemental centers are rarely active from birth and , for most people , must be activated manually .
te	1	Briefly inspecting the cuts , bruises , and bandages on his body , Lucas said , " I can walk , I 'll be fine .
te	3	Considering that the stars were always out and the lighting remained constant , it was difficult to tell when the days ended and the nights began .
te	3	As it struggled to escape , Alex thrust his blade into the insect 's thorax , causing it to shudder violently before it went limp .
te	4	As the spell swept over the monsters , they slowed considerably , eventually collapsing to the ground as their bodies were completely encased in ice .
te	0	Glancing at Zoe , he saw that she had also gained control of her situation , mercilessly bashing the imp 's head against a nearby tree .
te	0	The room was small and furnished with nothing but a bed , a nightstand , a dresser , a small sofa , and a coffee table .
te	3	Trying not to panic Zoe , Alex didn 't mention the oncoming threat and quickly sliced at the web in an attempt to free his companion .
te	4	The ascent was uneventful until Alex suddenly felt a strong jab on the back of his head , nearly causing him to lose his grip .
te	4	Her eyes widened , completely caught off guard , but slowly closed as she wrapped her arms around his neck , returning the display of affection .
te	3	I want to write a letter to Grandpa , just in case I 'm stuck here for a while ... so he knows what 's going on .
te	4	While she was gone , Lucas began writing the letter , summarizing all of the events which had occurred since his departure from the house .
te	3	I need to accept that there 's no way I 'm getting home unless I 'm patient and take the time to do this correctly .
te	3	Then she heard it again , followed by Lord Quinn 's voice , though it was too muffled and distant to tell exactly what he was saying .
te	1	" Pardon my criticism sir , " the man in the red cloak said , " but are you sure it was wise to kill our prisoner ?
te	1	Using The Basics of Light Magic , Lucas found that he was able to accomplish this task with much less effort , successfully healing his remaining injuries .
te	4	As we 've learned today , there could be a bunch of other groups and people going after it that we don 't even know about .
te	4	Hagan , however , despite the fact that he now had several cuts and additional bruises , did not feel that he needed the assistance .
te	1	" I found myself in a rough patch in my life ... I decided that I had had enough and ... well , I hung myself .
te	3	Once the knights show up to pick up the mail and see the damage , they 'll probably want to stop to investigate the area .
te	4	Iris outstretched both of her arms toward the enemies as Lucas 's orb smashed into one of the men , knocking him to the ground .
te	0	" I 've got it , " Hagan replied , launching an arrow at Fino , who simultaneously threw his massive fireball at the group .
te	2	" If you do not wish to be involved in my endeavors , I advise that you stay out of my way and keep your mouth shut .
te	3	It sounded to me like those Cobras were on their way to carry out another attack on a different town when they ran into us .
te	4	He was especially intrigued the day he stumbled across one particular book , entitled The Forbidden Art of Necromancy ( For Scholastic Use Only ! ) .
te	0	" Ya say a word or move an inch and you 're gon na get it , pal , " a voice behind him warned .
te	3	He 's terrified ... It 's hard to tell if he 's being truthful , but the worst he could do at this point is run away .
te	1	By assisting me in obtaining the missing fragment , you and your son shall be rewarded with high ranking titles and privileges under my reign . "
te	3	It 's a very unpleasant sensation , to say the least ... " " I don 't have time to waste , " Lord Quinn asserted .
te	1	" Very well , " said Veronica , " I 'm going to have to insist that you leave the room during this particular process .
te	2	He let out a cry of pain as Lucas and Iris turned to see one of the monstrous scorpions pulling its stinger out of him .
te	3	Taking advantage of this , it lunged its stinger at Lucas 's face , who quickly darted his head to the right to avoid it .
te	4	There was no conversation along the way , as Lucas and Iris had to use every ounce of physical and mental strength left to tote their teammate .
te	2	She stood like a statue , the look of anger on her face , her mouth still positioned to form words for her argument with Lord Quinn .
te	1	Still , Iris occasionally interrupted to verify his claims , likely a result of her own skepticism when Lucas initially told his tale to her .
te	1	" Now listen carefully , kids , " she continued , " I 'm going to tell you about my personal encounter with Javan Quinn .
te	3	It worked perfectly ... Thanks to the wine , it didn 't take long for him to doze off , allowing me an excellent opportunity to strike .
te	1	" I apologize for disturbing you , Master Quinn , " he said , " but there is an urgent situation which requires your attention immediately . "
te	4	Lucas intends to enroll at his school as one of his pupils once we have completed our work here , in order to advance his abilities . "
te	2	" I understand that Roshan was a very special person to you , and I know that you were only acting out of compassion for him .
te	0	Glancing around to be sure no one was nearby , he came to a halt and whispered , " Ma , can you hear me ? "
te	0	" If you 're serious about restoring peace to Aria , you 're going to have to face many dangers such as this along the way .
te	4	Both the group and the Cobras were shocked by the unexpected confrontation , briefly staring each other down in a brisk moment of sheer astonishment .
te	0	Meanwhile , Iris prepared to conjure another ice barrier as Hagan fired an arrow and Aiden 's hands burst , once again , into flames .
te	2	On the far side of the room was a decorative rug , which sat at the bottom of a stairway leading to another set of double doors .
te	0	" From what you said in town , I can assume that you 're already quite familiar with the In Between and Damiano 's Disk . "
te	2	On the two balconies , now with the curtains drawn back , additional Cobras stood equipped with loaded bows , their sights set on Lucas 's companions .
te	2	" Maybe I 'm just some ' boy ' throwing ' fairy dust , ' but you 're the one who lost to him . "
te	4	The men expressed that they wished to create a perfect soldier , capable of speech and free will , yet compelled to follow their every command .
te	3	He warned of his close connection to the king and was certain to make it known that anyone who betrayed his trust would be dealt with .
te	4	He hurriedly dressed himself and pursued her , but by the time he 'd run downstairs and made it outside , she was nowhere to be seen .
te	3	Though it still acted wildly and impulsively , it was ' embedded ' to fear Javan and the Crimson Clan , and thus would not attack them .
te	4	The king 's knights fought rigorously against the invaders , but found themselves greatly outnumbered as they continued to emerge from seemingly out of nowhere .
te	1	Though we will be unable to truly confirm my suspicion until Gavin has awoken , Zoe Quinn appears to be the only Spade missing . "
te	0	" You can afford to live in Regal Heights and own jewelry , yet all you have to carry it in is a pillowcase ? "
te	2	The sound of a hammer striking hot iron on an anvil in the shop 's backroom was audible over the voices of the many people .
te	2	" You can 't be too good with scythes if you let your guard down long enough for that to have happened to you . "
te	4	Zoe was uncertain of where she was going , but luckily managed to find that the northern border of the city was in close proximity .
te	3	" Still , until the day arrives when I at last open The Temple of Damiano , I am bound to the duties of my occupation .
te	2	" I suppose if you 're departing , " said Iris , " I would like to thank you once again for your generous support . "
te	1	It also mapped the coordinates of every known gateway constructed by Spades and Quinn 's men alike , along with their corresponding destination in Aria .
te	1	" This is a strange , dark corner of the world , Milo , " Browder continued , " full of strange , dark things .
te	3	Matthew Graham sat bolt upright in the middle of his bed , sweating profusely ; and not just due to the humid , summer air .
te	3	Although the darkness of the room was almost absolute , Matthew wasn 't about to do anything that might block his vision for even a heartbeat .
te	3	He knew that the thing was waiting him out , waiting for him to slacken his guard , waiting for the perfect moment to strike .
te	4	When all that reached his ears was hushed , indecipherable mumbling , Matthew threw caution to the wind and began gobbling his breakfast like a hog .
te	2	A boy your age , with so much growing yet to do , needs to be with his kin ... a home with a proper family . "
te	2	Matthew lingered just long enough to smile triumphantly and say , " Oops , always forgetting my manners , " before bolting from the room .
te	2	For a moment , Matthew was about to head upstairs to his room where he could crawl through the window and climb down the huge maple .
te	3	" The one and the same , " admitted the cowboy , " and you almost found me out more times than I care to admit . "
te	0	As I commit these words to paper , we are in Krakow , Poland , by way of Transylvania , having come at Milo 's behest .
te	0	Oh yeah , um ... " Matthew caught Bax 's sidelong glance as the cowboy said , " Where are his folks and grandpa ? "
te	0	Good thing I didn 't nail it shut , he thought as he opened it and crawled through onto the shingled roof of the porch .
te	1	" Like I said , wish I could help , but ... " " It 's not a problem , sir , " Bax said .
te	3	" Don 't fret it , little man , ain 't much of anything in these parts that can do more than spook a person . "
te	3	Though it had taken but a moment to catalogue all the hideous features , it struck Matthew that he had had too much time to do so .
te	3	Matthew didn 't , but he nodded anyway , frantically trying to envision any positive course of action that could possibly require him not to move .
te	4	As he spoke , he kicked the crate - which was tied to the other end of the rope - over the edge of the loft .
te	0	He glanced at Bax but the cowboy was too busy to have noticed ; he was already up and making his way over to the broken box .
te	0	We need to get as far away from here as we can , as fast as we can , while we still have a chance . "
te	4	Matthew looked back , and through the gloom , he could just make out the swirling cloud of the creatures as they lingered above their lost comrade .
te	3	" I know I 'm supposed to look on the bright side of things , but ... " A terrible thought struck Matthew like a lightning bolt .
te	3	As Bax opened the letter , Matthew observed at once , and with a lightning bolt of panic that ... " It 's blank ! "
te	1	Like the whole of old man Brewer 's barn , everything in it , including the crate and instructions had probably burned to the ground by now .
te	4	" If you , the young master , and that egg are elsewhere , do you really think there will be more trouble here ? "
te	4	" I reckon we 've got no choice but to ride out the night and hope the fire burns bright enough till sun up . "
te	4	And even if he was , he didn 't think he could sleep knowing that those scaly monsters were just waiting for a chance to attack .
te	3	Rather than hold on to it though , he quickly tossed it toward the yard , at which point Bax pulled him to his feet .
te	0	A porter approached to gather up their luggage , but Bax waved him off saying , " Thank you kindly , but we can manage . "
te	4	At the last second , just as the boys were passing Bax , one of the cowboy 's booted feet slid out into the aisle .
te	4	His immediate concern was that in the darkness , he would run smack into the door , in which case the creatures would have him .
te	4	He slid from the tree and joined Bax at the river 's edge , where the cowboy squatted , washing his plate in the slow flowing water .
te	4	Matthew and Bax wheeled around to see a woman standing on the boardwalk out of the rain , beneath the building 's street front balcony .
te	0	Her long hair , pulled back beneath a lively afternoon hat , was black as coal and lustrous , even in the grayness of the day .
te	4	Matthew returned the favor in kind , and before long , it seemed that there was more water on the floor than in the tubs .
te	2	For starters , I 'm not too keen on women folk who ... " Cordelia interrupted him , " Who say what they 're thinking ? "
te	2	" I 'm going to let you do yourself a favor by putting those fancy irons of yours on the table where I can see them . "
te	3	For a moment Matthew thought that Bax was going to chance it , but then the cowboy glanced at him , seeming to weigh the risk .
te	3	In spite of what Bax might think , Matthew felt himself a good judge of character , too , and he had been right about Cordelia .
te	4	" For one thing , Mr. Fleming , I don 't believe everything I read , " she said , nodding to the folded dodger .
te	4	" For someone who claims not to believe everything she reads , you have a mighty strange sense of what you choose to believe . "
te	4	He could scarcely believe it when Bax kept asking questions : " What manner of work do you have in mind , Miss McKenna ? "
te	1	" It means big animal messes , and I 'm having a premonition of me shoveling big animal messes all the way to St. Louis . "
te	2	If you help us , and the folks lookin ' for us get wind of it , you 'll be askin ' for a world of grief .
te	3	He regarded the dodger , comparing the illustration on it to Bax , before crumpling it into a ball and tossing it at Bax 's feet .
te	3	Whatever Cordelia was trying to tell him , Matthew was certain it was urgent and it had to do with the situation below him in the lobby .
te	2	Looking for himself , Matthew could make out a group of dark shapes at the far end of the row of buildings near the hotel .
te	4	Fog lay thick and heavy in the predawn darkness reducing the visible world to a matter of four or five feet in any given direction .
te	1	" And now , " she announced in a ringmaster 's tone , " the portion of the tour you 've both been waiting for . "
te	3	The sobering fact was that , as he looked around , he saw that the pile wasn 't unique , nor was it the largest .
te	3	If you want an elephant to remember something forever , you have to convey it to them in the only way that truly matters to them . "
te	4	There could be something wrong with George or Martha ; could be that they 're not getting enough of something they need in their diet .
te	3	" Assuming there was even a pinch of truth to that yarn , it sounds to me as though I just made a lucky shot . "
te	4	The cowboy seemed not to have noticed the fright he had caused , for he said , " I had a feelin ' you would run back .
te	4	With bullets plying the air , the three of them moved to the railing , making certain to keep the baled cargo between themselves and the gunmen .
te	0	A blood stained cloth was wrapped around the tall , gangly man 's left shoulder , the arm beneath supported by an equally blood-soaked sling .
te	3	Matthew ducked back down into the barrel , wrapping his arms around the egg to shield it , yet not so tightly as to break it .
te	3	Then his head snapped upward as the sound of the merchant 's approaching footsteps punctuated the tension in the air in time to Matthew 's thumping heart .
te	3	I 'm not tryin ' to get your hopes up , but there 's no reason to think they aren 't still on their way there .
te	4	Cordelia lifted her chin and , in a no-nonsense , matter-of-fact tone said , " I think you have yourselves a dragon 's egg . "
te	0	In either case , you should have a new traveling companion , a young acquaintance of mine from Michigan whom I am eager to meet again .
te	3	They stood , waiting in dread anticipation , shifting their gazes from one pitch black alleyway to the other , from the alleys to the sky above .
te	2	It growled like a mad dog as it dropped to all fours , crouched low , and proceeded to circle him , looking to strike .
te	1	Pistol in hand , Bax reached forth and , with his fingertips , felt of the dark wall until he did in fact discover a door .
te	3	" It 's one thing to hit a mess of critters behind a wall , but it 's another thing entirely to hit just one . "
te	1	Judging from the constricting noose , that Bax was sure would cut him in half before it freed him , his friend was giving his all .
te	2	" How could I not recognize in you the courage of your mother , Elizabeth , and the boldness of your father , Charles ? "
te	2	" One or the other of us has been on the roof for the past three days , waiting and watching for you to show up . "
te	4	Bax continued , " Whatever manner of egg it is , I can 't imagine that Charles , Elizabeth or Milo didn 't know it for themselves .
te	4	Bax was the last to do so , but even he had to admit that he sensed nothing threatening in the strange reptile 's change of behavior .
te	4	Down the length of the hall , apparently roused by the growing ruckus , he saw a few curious faces peering from some of the other doors .
te	0	He could see fire , and the blaze was spreading , crawling up the walls , dancing along the winding banisters of both spiral staircases .
te	3	On second thought , he motioned Matthew still further away with a flick of his chin , and then Sol too was freed of its holster .
te	0	The thing 's hideous face , like any varmint 's face had soft spots , and Bax had six rounds with which to fill them .
te	4	Both Cordelia and Ochoa had their own pistols reloaded by then , but as they stepped forward , the creature was already dead at Bax 's feet .
te	0	He swung outward in a relatively graceful arc , but just as he was carried back toward the building , he began to drop straight down .
te	0	Bax was about to remark that the extra weight was all muscle when he noticed that Americus was peeling a pair of cowhide gloves from his hand .
te	0	Americus smiled warmly and tousled Matthew 's hair ; drawing his hand back when the dragon hissed a warning from the collar of the boy 's poncho .
te	3	A bit too spirited , he thought , as he caught Matthew by the tail of his poncho , just before he was about to jump .
te	4	Byrnes proceeded to hand each of the men a torch of his own from a small crate nestled among the stalagmites at the edge of the path .
te	3	The passage they had descended through had widened into a spacious cavern throughout which a forest of stalactites and stalagmites cast jittery shadows in the flickering torchlight .
te	2	You can answer my question and hobble out of here on your one good foot , or I 'll put you down like the cur you are .
te	4	" This had better be the last time I ever lay eyes you , you ugly varmint , " he called after the fleeing henchman .
te	3	To Matthew I hope , Bax thought before saying , " I don 't know , but judging from the echo it sounds fairly extensive . "
te	4	Matthew 's eyes were brimming with tears that he managed to keep from running down his face as he fixed the lawyer with a hateful stare .
te	4	Everyone flinched as a gunshot rang out , the sound almost deafening as it bounced around the cavern , mingling with the roar of the waterfall .
te	4	" Wish I could , " he replied as first Americus and then Ochoa left the ledge behind and joined them in the bowl chamber .
te	3	Scouting the high edges of the cavern , they found the mouths of several tunnels amid the thicket of stony formations , but no telltale poncho threads .
te	4	When the monotony showed no sign of ending , Matthew found his eyes growing heavy , until eventually he drifted off into a much needed sleep .
te	4	They moved quickly , their pace akin to a fast walk , quickly discovering that anything faster caused the bridge to convulse wildly beneath their feet .
te	0	Bax drew Mani as he went , wishing he could draw Sol as well , but they could not afford to abandon even a single lamp .
te	0	He glanced back and saw that Americus had slipped his revolving rifle into the scabbard on his back , and now held Magna at the ready .
te	0	Without another word , Bax drew Mani and set out again , evading the crackling tongues of fire licking at him from the ropes and planks .
te	0	If he said yes , he had a feeling the man would want to know what he heard - which wasn 't much , of course .
te	3	He intended to wait until the last possible moment in the hope of bringing the ceiling down on the first of the varmints to cross the threshold .
te	4	: -- RRB - I thank all people , who accompanied me on the way up to now and who supported me in these times .
te	3	Therefore , take my " Thank you " and be sure that it 's much , much more than just words captured in black letters .
te	0	These people encouraged me and took away from me many tasks , fears and obligations that caught me up to that time like a boa .
te	2	In the meantime , my book is no work just of mine , but a common project of many people , who are invisible for fans .
te	4	Last , but not least , it 's my fans , who won 't be mentioned here by names , because there are too many of you !
te	4	It was such a pleasure and honour to be one of the jury members , who I allowed to look at every piece of your creativity !
te	2	Of course , you had wouldn 't talk about it , because such secrets should not give an opportunity for anybody to make a fool of you !
te	4	Everybody was laughing , remembering the holidays , which seemed to be so far away from reality now like the distance between the earth and the moon .
te	4	Thereby Mia had the opportunity to get to know the new school and this one visit was enough to memorize all the details she needed to know .
te	0	As she was reading aloud , she forgot about the entire world , and reality around her was further away than the things she was reading .
te	2	Now , he already had a good reputation on the market and therefore he was in the good position of being his own boss and a student .
te	1	In addition , he had time to organise parties with his friends and to observe how " Sunshine " turned into the best club in the city .
te	4	He had already understood from her voice that she was a professional , but to be on the safe side , he had to be prepared anyway .
te	1	She wasn 't hidden ; she was just sitting with one of the books many girls love to read these days , some story about vampires .
te	4	# 11 IT IS ALL COMING BACK TO ME She can see it in the colour of the eyes in the moment when a person dies .
te	2	You just have an assumption , which can lead you directly to your goal , or to the opposite , it can throw you off your course .
te	0	Sebastian was trembling a little , but he didn 't let go of her because he was afraid she would turn around and walk away .
te	4	How can you be sure of something in one moment and in the next you 're already convinced that you had been foolish or even worse ?
te	0	It was a late afternoon and usually it would have been already grey outside , as it had been in the last few cloudy days .
te	2	Just two fellows were standing motionless , looking doubtfully at this vivid event , whereas the doubts were not so obvious on Julian 's face .
te	1	Everything in this apartment was simple and there were no personal things around , if you don 't count Mia 's books in her room .
te	3	It was the first gift in Mia 's life and she didn 't want to ruin anything , but she felt a need to explain the situation .
te	0	After the death of grandma Zofia , she had at least two afternoons off and she felt comfortable enough to sit in his apartment and read .
te	0	The Carpathian Mountains are a range of mountains forming a long arc across Central and Eastern Europe , making them the largest mountain range in Europe .
te	0	Mrs. Nowak was from the generation of Mia 's grandmother and she was the person who was the grandmother , which Mia always wished to have .
te	4	Over years , the picture in his mind became clearer and sharper and now he could finally see her entire face and her person in real .
te	1	She was used to being observed , but his look had such deepness and such intensity , it was almost impossible to sit there and relax .
te	4	It wasn 't one of my best smiles ever , I guess it wasn 't even a smile and that is why he didn 't believe me .
te	2	If you have never been in Wroclaw or to any other big Polish city , you have to know how to find your way around in Poland .
te	1	He didn 't see " his girl " ( as he used to call Anna ) for days and she didn 't answer his calls .
te	1	Sebastian 's mind kept warning him : she is like a fire , if you start to play with it , you will lose it .
te	3	Julian didn 't want to go to such a party , he was busy with his things , but he was afraid of forgetting something important .
te	0	I am looking for her , I was out and about during the last days and I guess I have to relax and slow down a little .
te	0	As she was sitting , again , he put his hanky on the wound and then he swathed her leg with a bandage she brought with her .
te	4	She had her own room ( Mia called it a cell in her thoughts ) and it looked like the old lady was getting anything she needed .
te	4	He promised her to leave her in peace after all , so he had to use every time he could find to have her here .
te	4	It could have been because of her current state , and on the other hand , it could have no meaning for it at all .
te	3	Sometimes he just acted as if he would eat , but it was just a game , because he didn 't want to catch anyone 's attention .
te	2	If you had someone who cares about you , you wouldn 't go with me and you would have protested at the latest in my car .
te	3	He didn 't show up and she didn 't intend to go back and apologize although she knew that this option was the right one .
te	2	She just stood watching this painting for a while and in any cartoon movie , she would look like a person with a jaw hitting the floor .
te	3	She stepped closer and looked particularly at the people in the painting and then she watched the city 's buildings and thought about colours and colour combinations .
te	3	He was still invisible , but the lack of concentration could cost him a lot : he could be unmasked and it wasn 't what he wanted .
te	4	Smaller and bigger pieces of wood flew through the air and she had to put her hands in front of her face to protect her eyes .
te	1	In addition , she drank it as if it was something she was doing daily or as if she didn 't feel the heat at this moment .
te	4	Julian couldn 't describe it with words , but he had a special feeling about her and she became his obsession from the very beginning .
te	1	If Sebastian got mad about her , Julian could still care about him in his invisible form , and he could observe Mia in the same way .
te	0	Julian was mostly invisible and at first as Sebastian moved to Warsaw he arranged a get-together and in this way , they met each other personally .
te	0	Nothing happened without a reason and such a calculated and mean person like Jonas had to have a reason to behave the way he did .
te	0	The Easter Ram made from the cake mass was dried , then cut , put into milk and eggs , baked and eaten with cinnamon and sugar .
te	4	She ordered him to cream the butter and sugar together until they became light and fluffy , and then he added three eggs to the mass .
te	4	He told her about his latest troubles when he went shopping and had an issue with his credit card , because it couldn 't be read .
te	2	After more than two hours of monologue and two pots of tea , Mia brought him back to reality by saying she had to go .
te	4	She left him as quickly as she arrived , but she left him in a kind of mood , which he wished to be in every day .
te	3	Sometimes they wanted to have a short summary of the translated text in addition to the translation and with such tasks Mia was the best .
te	0	Mia saw a shadow of sorrow in Sebastian 's face and she didn 't want him to think there was something between her and Julian .
te	4	Every time she mentioned the name of his best friend , Sebastian got a small stitch in his heart and some fear tried to overwhelm him .
te	4	She stood there for a moment , her smile was gone and she still waited for his reaction , but it didn 't make any sense .
te	4	One false action , one wrong movement , and he could destroy everything that was precious to him and that he was supposed to protect .
te	0	She should give him some information , but it should proceed in a natural way and it should take away all that was left of her dignity .
te	0	Julian started walking , but he caused such a wave of air that she had to open her eyes and saw the world in a blur .
te	2	Her heart was beating like boom , boom , boom , in a rhythm of a jumpy , dynamic Black Eyed Peas or Kevin Rudolf song .
te	4	He couldn 't explain why he did it , it was forbidden , but he couldn 't leave her alone and see how she was suffering .
te	4	He could easily give her too much energy and she would break down like an ant crushed by an elephant or an eagle caught in a tornado .
te	3	It was more logical that she wasn 't at her senses , but if he told her the truth , then she was right in her theory .
te	4	She was able to swallowed the rest of the mixture of blood and spit sitting in her throat and then she was able to breathe freely again .
te	4	She would surely wake up in a couple of minutes and she will be too shy to ask him whether this was real or not .
te	4	Mia made some steps forward and when she saw a tiny grassland , she ran there and only when she reached the middle , she stopped .
te	4	He was sure she was the only human being in the world , which he wanted to see every day , every night , always .
te	4	Then he took her hand in front of his face and kissed her fingers slowly and carefully - like a gentleman does when he meets a lady .
te	4	If you have ever experienced the feeling of great joy and endless happiness , it is very hard to come back to the grey reality .
te	1	It was no time for such a dress -- it was early spring , everything was turning green and it was quite cold , I suppose .
te	3	I will take the entire responsibility for what I will tell you , but you have to think about it and say what you want .
te	2	Imagine you have a cut diamond , it is transparent , you can look inside of it , and you see the millions of colours there .
te	1	He was very pleased that someone is interested in his work and as I saw his art , I said , it won 't work .
te	0	So , one day , I brought a nobleman with me and as he saw Canaletto 's work , he wanted to have such a painting too .
te	2	Up to now , there was no such case in our family 's history and we usually don 't make any exceptions from our rules .
te	2	One evening , he said quietly , but serious : - Nothing I could say to you could show you how I feel about you .
te	2	You wouldn 't be able to resist the desire to drink it all , it would be hardly possible for you to stop half way .
te	1	- Mia , nothing in this world will change my love for you , but I cannot change the world in the way I would like .
te	2	- If you would like to , you can move here and I will bring you to school every day and pick you up in the afternoon .
te	1	It would be enough for his family to judge it , and this decision wouldn 't be in any way good to Julian and Mia .
te	0	His Mustang wasn 't just fast ; it was fast and furious , wild like a real mustang , although it was a high-speed machine .
te	0	It was hard to concentrate on what the teachers were talking about and in fact , schoolbooks were not as fascinating as Julian 's stories .
te	3	She didn 't like to attract attention and avoided such situations it as much as possible and now Julian was leading her here , through this boutique .
te	0	Julian was partially afraid that she was scared of whom he was , and that was the reason why she didn 't talk much about herself .
te	2	It was like when you are on a street and hear a hooter and you don 't know form which direction it was coming from .
te	0	Today she had to admit that this room was similar to the rest of Sebastian 's apartment : plain and classy , but cosy as well .
te	4	She couldn 't even say goodbye , because she didn 't want to give Jonas any reason to be violent to people who were important for her .
te	4	Mia killed Julian , she killed him , she killed him ... These three words echoed in her head corresponding to the rhythm of the running train .
te	2	I haven 't told you yet how pleased I was by your line " I don 't love you , I 'm scared of you " .
te	2	She didn 't know much about you and therefore I had to rely on your answers , which of course , I didn 't get .
te	4	Her life wasn 't the best , there has never been much success , in fact , it was more a sequence of defeats and scary moments .
te	4	Mia followed the old lady 's silent order and when she was ready , the Russian driver came to pick her up and she ensued him .
te	0	Sebastian tried to stand up , but before he could even moved , Jonas was already in front of him and had caught his throat .
te	2	I will get to know all of her thoughts and wishes and you won 't stop me , because you 're not as great as I am .
te	2	Sebastian didn 't know what he was talking about , something inside of him spoke through his soul and forced him to speak foreign words .
te	0	He was mad , he was furious and he jumped so hastily at Jonas that Jonas was pushed away and smashed against the opposite wall .
te	1	Slowly ashes and pieces from the house started to rain down and Sebastian was hit by some wooden parts and stones falling down from above .
te	0	He wasn 't able to remember what happened last night , but he had a crazy dream , Mia was there and Julian was there .
te	2	Her body warned her long enough about its bad condition , and now the rest of her bodily problems started to follow through with their own claims .
te	2	From them both , from the duo of an almost immortal and mortal being , this was the end of the road for the first one .
te	3	Therefore , take my " Thank you " and be sure that it 's much , much more than just words captured in black letters .
te	0	These people encouraged me and took away from me many tasks , fears and obligations that caught me up to that time like a boa .
te	2	In the meantime , my book is no work just of mine , but a common project of many people , who are invisible for fans .
te	0	She had nowhere to go and she wasn 't strong enough to hit him hard enough to somehow get by him , much less overpower him .
te	0	Idiot that she was , she had to take a shortcut and die in a dark back alley at the hands of a cruel outcast .
te	4	" You need to give me something ; the Gods need to know who to bless when I thank them for sending you my way . "
te	0	The Healer sat down in a chair in Nia 's spacious chamber and said , " So , what have you been up to ? "
te	3	Hate to break it to you , sweetheart , but you can 't afford my services ; at least that 's what your wonderful predecessor told me .
te	4	In her experience most men found it easier to talk to a ' harmless ' woman than to a soldier with a sword at the ready .
te	0	He took a breath and said a bit more civilized , which wasn 't civilized at all , " Yeah , you can help me .
te	4	If she weren 't already dead , he would have found a way to throw her out of the fortress that had been his home .
te	3	If there was one thing that never failed to rile his usually calm , rational brother , then it was a threat to his life .
te	3	" They won 't feel save to contact me if they think I 'm working for a mad shrew with a penchant for blood . "
te	2	" No , I 've got one last question for you , Healer : what did the message remind you of that you almost lost it ? "
te	0	There she had discovered who he was -- and had had to resign herself to the fact that she had no chance to bring him down .
te	0	" About twenty-five years ago , I was just of age , I came home one day after training and found my whole family in an uproar .
te	4	At last , she said so quietly that he almost didn 't hear her , " No , in all those years I 've found only her .
te	2	And if you doubt my words on this , then you only have to spend a week in any infirmary to confirm my words ! "
te	0	We are talking about a little girl not yet six years old and all you say is ' she can 't have been hurt that badly ' ?
te	4	Not a single person saw the little girl leave , which was strange because there 's only one entrance and it 's heavily guarded . "
te	4	Most likely the man used some of his Idris power to hide what he didn 't want to be seen behind a cloak of darkness .
te	2	They had to carefully watch the balance of their souls to not lose themselves in corruption and cruelty -- and Onyx was close , too close .
te	3	Sure , Blade was a great asset in every battle , but the man had the annoying habit of trying to take control of everything .
te	2	I might not have been the most rational of men the last months but I do know how to do my job properly , dimwit ! "
te	3	The only explanation I can come up with is that they knew we were coming and that the bastard used his Illusion Talent to trick us .
te	2	It was close to midnight now and he was sitting on the roof of the safe house and thought about what had gone down today .
te	3	So , if you don 't want to get acquainted to my temper , then you might want to keep any challenges to a minimum . "
te	4	" Well , I mean they have to be huge for her to let you off without at least calling you every name in the book ? "
te	4	I took her back to the kitchen and asked if anyone had seen her near there , when some of the older boys came back from training .
te	1	She was the Princess of Pyr , and though she was a disgrace , she wouldn 't add ' wimp ' to her growing list of flaws .
te	0	She had a happy look on her face , and appeared totally at ease in midst of the tall and proud animals that towered over her .
te	3	" Here , take that , your Highness ; it is a left over from last week and quite old , but it 's better than nothing .
te	2	One by one , she pulled out the chocolates and the fluffy doll from my pockets and like on any other day , was looking for more .
te	3	I stopped the SUV so that he was close to the trunk ; and pressed the button on the control panel to open the trunk .
te	4	My eye signal requested him to direct the complaint to the passengers in the rear seats as I didn 't want to take the blame .
te	3	Forgetting I wasn 't supposed to talk about it , I casually said " All this was because of the Sparrow that flew into their house . "
te	4	I managed to force her to give me a piece , though she resisted a few times by saying it was meant for after dinner .
te	0	About a quarter mile away , we saw a series of blue and red lights flashing ; probably due as a result of an accident .
te	4	I couldn 't believe why I 'm experiencing this new form of life as I was an ardent nonbeliever of life after death in any form .
te	3	" Shattering all that I thought was right , here I 'm , out of my body , thinking and seeing things in a new realm .
te	2	So , do not jump to conclusions or impose all of your ideas on me or force me to believe what you believe , yet .
te	2	You better hold onto me if you want me , " Chris was still in the jovial mood he got from his last jab at me .
te	3	Contrary to all the other religions this is the unique concept in Buddhist teachings , " Dan paused as he saw Chris wanting to say something .
te	3	In Buddhism the impetus to your next life is the last thought of your present life or the thought you have at the time of death .
te	3	" Interesting but complex ; I need to think a bit on that , " Chris said " Let me go a little further on this .
te	0	Because your question has an error with a word ' who ' in it , a valid answer cannot be construed , " Dan said .
te	4	My second guess is , perhaps all of us are already born in a ghostly realm due to the sins we have done in the past .
te	3	I think it 's best for me to say I don 't know rather than trying to come up with a bogus answer , " Dan said .
te	2	" Dan , do you think you have the seeds of all good and bad things you 've done along your life journey so far ?
te	3	" You may not have heard this , but the Quran sets the age of responsibility at 40 ; that 's the age of full maturity .
te	1	In my view , the belief aspect is secondary as the intention of all religions is to bring good to mankind , " Chris said .
te	1	While this is admittedly impossible for the author him - or herself , I submit that I did in a certain fashion accomplish my mission .
te	1	Thomas Jefferson , the third president of the United States , understood this fact intimately , having himself become a significant land owner in Virginia .
te	2	With a bold stroke , he purchased Louisiana from Napoleon in 1803 for fifteen million dollars and overnight doubled the size of the fledgling country .
te	0	At the outbreak of the Texas Revolution , he was married to Lucinda Lopez de Santa Anna , sister of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna .
te	4	So there was another reason to build the barn , and Hank had gotten it done in the spring of their second year in Texas .
te	4	It had been a hard trek over land to get there , but all in all Hank was happy with the plot they 'd been granted .
te	3	In fact , the population of Bastrop seemed to have tripled overnight , and he meant to find out exactly what the excitement was about .
te	0	Hank couldn 't tell whether the man was talking up to him or down , which was curious since Hank was near a head taller than him .
te	0	When that happens , that 's where I 'll heading , and I 'll be taking along anybody that is of a mind to join me .
te	0	It seemed to him as if it had only been a few days since General Santa Anna 's army had swept through his village near Zacatecas .
te	4	He had been too young and new , so he had only helped with feeding soldiers , and after the battle , with caring for the wounded .
te	3	Since the countryside hadn 't been so much different all the way down from Lexington , he hadn 't thought much about it at the time .
te	4	He had simply assumed that sort of countryside would stretch all the way to the west coast , which he 'd heard was way out there somewhere .
te	4	Since the dissolution of Congress , the northern states of Mexico had rebelled , several of them even going so far as to declare independence .
te	0	It was a long rough ride , and she wasn 't one to waste a day that could be used for some back breaking chore or another .
te	0	With this thought in mind , Hank honed his story for an entire day before approaching Julie with what he thought would meet her approval .
te	2	Of course , that doesn 't rule out the possibility of minor skirmishes sooner , what with some troops already on the ground in Texas . "
te	0	In his view , it was a fundamental act of humankind to walk , and it just so happened this was a perfect day for it .
te	4	Hank really didn 't care much for walking , but it seemed the prudent thing to do since he cared even less for traveling alone .
te	3	In Hank 's opinion , once the decision was made to get into a war , you ought to go straight after it without hesitation .
te	3	" Well , sir , it seems that the Egyptians thought that beetles were gods , " Hawk continued , attempting to clear up the mystery .
te	3	" Don 't know quite what to say to that , Mr. Hawk Banks , " Hank said , continuing to trudge on down the trail .
te	4	I expect it does sound somewhat bizarre to you , but where I come from , this would all be pretty normal subject matter . "
te	1	" Meaning , about them beetles that shit their offspring in a dung hole , " Hank added , grinning proudly at his newfound cognition .
te	3	Columbus didn 't discover this continent until about three hundred years ago , and the Egyptians began worshipping beetles a lot longer ago than that .
te	1	In my religion , if I eat a beetle , I absorb all of its godliness , and that 's where we started this discussion .
te	1	" Well , here 's the thing , boys , " Hawk announced , " I 'm a Ranger - sworn to defend Texans against Indians .
te	0	By now , satisfied that the brave was not coming for him , Hawk leaned over to the woman and asked her if she was alright .
te	4	She yanked the ropes off as fast as lightening , grabbed Hawk 's knife and ran for the pup who had been on top of her .
te	4	I haven 't got it all quite clear yet since folks all seem to be in a rush , but here is what I know .
te	3	Most folks think that being ordered to give it back violates the Constitution of 1824 , so they 're refusing to comply with the request .
te	1	The cannon went off once and , as there was still too much darn fog , Hank hadn 't the slightest idea what was going on .
te	4	From Hank 's viewpoint , everyone seemed to be overly optimistic , and worse still , the army appeared to be little more than a mob .
te	0	Word came to Austin shortly thereafter that General Cos and his army of five hundred soldiers had vacated Goliad and marched to Bexar a few days earlier .
te	0	The other was the Alamo in Bexar , and it was now clear to Austin that Cos planned to make it his base of operations .
te	3	Hawk had to be at least fifteen years older than him , but that wily son of a no good tree stump could walk for sure .
te	4	They could see plenty of mesquite trees , but very few appeared to be large enough to meet the requirements laid out by Sergeant Pena .
te	2	As it turned out , they only had to go upriver a couple of hundred yards before they found a large stand of cottonwood trees .
te	0	Since he abhorred the thought of digging ditches , Francisco was suddenly very glad that he had spoken up , but his optimism was short lived .
te	4	" Already cleaned mine , " Hawk observed , " I expect I 'll get myself a poke , soon as we 're there . "
te	1	Mims had financed the scheme , and although Fannin had succeeded in transporting a fair number of slaves , he had continued to carry significant debts .
te	1	His surprise evident at this offer , Hawk responded politely , " Sir , I have had no military training in my entire life . "
te	3	But despite this , he continued to wade headlong into adversity , always the optimist , ever certain that his next adventure would turn a fortune .
te	3	Now to the point - we are challenged with somehow deploying a volunteer army that is little more than a mob into a daunting foray .
te	0	The infernal heat that had infested Texas the previous summer was now slowly filtering away into a glorious autumn with cool nights and pleasant days .
te	0	As quickly as a new crop arrived , ready to join up , just as many or more left , tired of the inaction by General Austin .
te	4	One must take life as it comes , because I 'm here to tell you , this is the only one you got , sir .
te	3	When captured , the boys had said that it was not theft -- they were just appropriating weapons so that they could join the Army of Texas !
te	1	The two of you will make a perfect pair for this assignment , " and all three were by this point smiling in joint complicity .
te	1	Hawk would never have considered entering the city on his own , but he found it surprisingly easy to do so with Juan Seguin as his companion .
te	3	Here was not only something to do to take away from the boredom that had set in , but he now had access to the city .
te	0	Hawk decided to try another approach , inquiring , " Señora , if you don 't mind me asking , what would make you happy ? "
te	4	He was still contemplating the latest turn of events when there came a knock at his door , eliciting from him , " Please enter ! "
te	3	It was the first one of the coming winter , the one that reminds you what you had forgotten that you disliked so much about winter .
te	3	Hank , continuing to scratch himself distractedly , observed , " Well now , that does sound important , I 'll give you that , Hawk .
te	0	San Antonio Hawk had barely managed to contain himself till sundown , but once it had grown dark he 'd immediately set off for the city .
te	3	When he spots the enemy approaching , he can inform you so that you have sufficient time to send out a party to cut them off . "
te	4	Quickly brushing off the shavings from the stick he 'd been whittling mindlessly , he raced over to the horse shed to saddle up Achilles .
te	0	he yelped and , hastily jumping up to pull on his boots , he prepared to march out as quickly as his distracted brain would allow .
te	2	One soldier let out a whoop and said , " We got ' em , Colonel Bowie , we got ' em on the run ! "
te	0	Hank scanned about in search of Hawk , and sure enough , there he was off to his left , not more than a hundred yards distant .
te	3	" No sir , there ain 't no silver , " and it was clear that Hawk was not the least bit happy at this revelation .
te	2	The Mexicans , many of whom under his command were felons , wanted nothing more of this group of wild men from the back woods .
te	4	He wondered how in the name of the Virgin Mary he would be able to rally his troops to win this battle in this godforsaken place .
te	4	" Sir , with all due respect , I believe that neither option is the right one for us at this moment , " Hawk replied .
te	3	Somebody said that the command staff had been surveying the defenses , that they had been ordered to attack at this particular point for that very reason .
te	1	He thought momentarily how incongruous it was to be admiring a woman in such a life-threatening situation , suddenly realizing that he had no weapon .
te	4	The heat of the day was fetid within the stone houses , flies fighting for the opportunity to buzz and bite whoever entered each enclosure .
te	2	But what 's got me worried the most is the paltry number of troops we will have here when Grant and Johnson head out for Matamoros .
te	3	Hawk was not a man to shirk his duty , but he was thinking on the attachment that he had begun to feel for Señora Perez .
te	3	I have discussed this with her , and it is our mutual view that the best place to go at this time is to Bastrop .
te	1	For her part , Antonia simply sat down within the tiny fortress , inquiring to Hank , " Does he know what he 's doing ? "
te	3	While Hank 's supposition that the simplest thing for the Indians to do was to wait , Hawk reasoned that they would not do this .
te	3	It 's not more than two feet wide , but it 's just right for me to get the jump on them , I reckon . "
te	4	Surely he didn 't think that Hank could really pick off four of them , armed with two rifles , a knife and a piece of wood !
te	0	Hank dreamed that he was in hand-to-hand combat with a giant snake , which was pretty interesting , seeing as how snakes had no hands .
te	0	While he was doing that , Hawk loaded the third , then slapped Antonia , not too hard , but hard enough to shut her up .
te	0	" Aw , hell , " Hawk said , grabbing her and , pulling her to him , wrapped her in a great bear hug .
te	3	He now turned to Bonham and said , " We 'll be taking those three horses now if that is alright with you , sir . "
te	1	Hawk and Hank began preparing to depart for Bastrop when one of the Grey 's came running up to Major Bonham and yelled , " Indians !
te	3	Throughout the playing out of this bizarre scene , the prairie fire , now no more than fifty yard distant , continued to expand and intensify .
te	4	To make matters worse , quite a few men had deemed the war to be over , and they had simply set off for home .
te	4	Having accomplished his objective , he hopped down from the horse , certain that he had made a new friend , and a famous one at that .
te	3	He was standing at the highest point in the fort , on the dirt parapet built as a buttress against the rear wall of the old mission .
te	0	It had been a long cold winter , and Hawk had said little most days , but when he got to talking it was always colorful .
te	3	I 'd say that is about the most ridiculously understated description of our current predicament that any man could ever conjure up , sir . "
te	0	was all Hawk replied , and so saying , he immediately turned Achilles and drove hard for Bexar , racing as fast as Achilles would take him .
te	2	Three months ago , I wouldn 't have cared one way or the other , but now I have just as much to live for as you .
te	0	" Hot damn , we 're gon na have ourselves a turkey shoot , " he said , and punctuated it by dancing around in a circle .
te	4	He rushed to the table and , his relief all too apparent , he realized how he must have looked to her , but he was desperate .
te	3	Travis now attempted another approach , pleading softly , " Sir , you must at least recognize that you are in no position to command this army .
te	2	" However , as for the first option , it goes against my orders , and I will not disobey my orders , sir . "
te	3	How about those two that rode out to check up on the Mexican Army two days ago - can I take them , sir ? "
te	3	Now that he 'd figured that out , it was just a matter of details , meaning exactly how to go about accomplishing his buddy 's getaway .
te	2	Bexar was the only other major garrison on the plains , the pair of missions the only means of halting the advance of the Army of Mexico .
te	4	Bonham exclaimed , " We have accomplished what we feared most of all - we have succeeded in enraging the entire population of Mexico , sir . "
te	4	Realizing exactly what he had to do , he set off for General Santa Anna 's headquarters , whereupon he reported that he had discovered a spy .
te	3	As a result , it was possible to climb up to the highest point within the Alamo and look toward the east - towards Seguin 's ranch .
te	2	Although he was a natural born citizen of Mexico , he was no longer in a position to choose which side he would prefer to support .
te	0	Hawk stared at Juan for a moment and , the reality of it sinking in , murmured wretchedly , " I was afraid of that .
te	3	Nate only heard maybe four or five shots fired , and in little more than a minute , Bonham was through the gate and into the fort .
te	4	As he pondered whether this was going to be the final assault , he noticed that the cannons weren 't firing from the opposite river bank .
te	4	He was simply swept up in the fervor , the great sense of national pride as he and his fellow soldiers pressed forward to defeat the enemy .
te	1	Susannah staggered into the courtyard , momentarily blinded by the brilliant sunlight , intent only on maintaining her balance so as to avoid injuring Angelina .
te	2	They would not go down without a fight , and executing Colonel Fannin 's entire army would ultimately only make things worse for the Army of Mexico .
te	0	The man stared at Francisco , an indescribable expression on his face - was it fear , or was it hatred -- turned , and ran .
te	2	Fifty Yards Away Hank , sprinting as fast his legs would carry him , hoped that in the smoke and confusion no one would follow .
te	2	He had taken the occasion to open a bottle of his finest porto , his porter now pouring a glass for each of the officers .
te	0	He hoped that Houston was a smarter man than he appeared to be , that he had conceived of a visionary scheme that would save the day .
te	0	But he had rallied yet again , at which point Hawk was obliged to admit great admiration for the way the general had recovered his composure .
te	4	It developed that while Hawk and his now deceased buddies had been surrounded at the Alamo , a new government had been formed at San Felipe .
te	0	There was now in Texas an Army of Mexico that numbered nearly ten thousand combatants , and there was no Army of Texas to speak of .
te	1	Raising her rifle , she shouted forcefully , " Mister , you walk this way , and don 't you be trying nothin ' suspicious ! "
te	0	Hank coughed a bit and spat out , " No sir , no sir , ain 't possible that 's a hug from a ghost .
te	1	He 'd spent one especially dismal afternoon cooking up a pot of boiling animal fat and mud , subsequently basting the tent with the obscene concoction .
te	0	" Har , har , " Hawk shot back , his head clearing , " Stinks to high heaven in here , but we 're dry .
te	3	" Alright , I get your point , " Hank murmured and , apparently regretting this last inanity , repeated , " I get it .
te	3	" Well , that is a long story , and it doesn 't exactly apply here , but let 's just say that he outsmarted them .
te	4	So now here he sat with an army that was shrinking by the day , and half of those who remained were under the weather .
te	2	On the other hand , if he could somehow maneuver to engage one and only one of them , they might just score a victory of sorts .
te	0	Her family had come a long way to get away from war and killing , and it had all followed them right here to Texas .
te	4	Peering above , off in the distance beyond the far shore , she thought she could see a banner -- the approach of Santa Anna 's scouts .
te	3	The soldiers had first tied the pair up , and then sat around the fire getting drunk so as to show off their manliness to one another .
te	4	He was accompanied by an entourage of similarly dressed men who , following a series of commands issued by their leader , did his bidding without question .
te	3	She couldn 't figure out why they were trying only him , but it didn 't take long to find out they 'd found him guilty .
te	0	They had managed to evade Santa Anna 's army for more than a month , but now it was all coming down to the end game .
te	2	Hawk rose , a cup of coffee in his hand , and volunteered , " Well , then , I got good news for you , Corporal .
te	2	Because you 're either gon na be on your way to meet the God you just got through damning , or this war is going be over .
te	0	As he did so , he spotted the advancing Texas Army and , screaming in abject fear , he ran to the rear waving his arms .
te	0	Hank assumed that he could see or hear something , though Hank couldn 't tell what it might be in this pea soup of a fog .
te	1	Hank , momentarily frozen in place , lunged for Julie , encircling her within a grateful embrace , Julie returning his adoration with a sly grin .
te	3	At that moment , the sound of a baby 's wail bursting from within the cabin , Julie turned to see what the crying was about .
te	4	The Alamo would become one of the most famous historical sites on Earth , visited by more Texans than any other place in the world .
te	3	The one that doesn 't , the last on the right , groans , " Please , doctor your alarmist viewpoint does not do you justice . "
te	4	Once this happens we can get to their central cores , figure out how to emulate their protocols and order their vessels to stand down permanently .
te	4	Some of his colleagues have speculated many of the younger generations of humans have fallen in battle , but Doctor Hartman believes humanity may have become sterile .
te	2	" Oh very well Doctor , but you and I are going to have a proper conversation about this one of these days , " Warrior declares .
te	0	Eleanor , a tall thin woman with grey hair but a smooth complexion , takes her seat in the command chair of Blade 's main control hub .
te	3	Tell them what we are planning to do and if they wish to provide support they are welcome , but this mission is voluntary . "
te	1	His dark flesh appears to stretch over his grotesquely swollen muscles in such a manner as to suggest at any moment the flesh would tear or burst .
te	2	We could have just flown into a pulse shield or had over two hundred pulse cannon rounds rain hell on us , " Warrior groans .
te	0	" If it is any consolation , I did download several combat and strategic protocols before leaving the medical bay , " Hartman offers enthusiastically .
te	4	As they step inside , the translucent walls ignite brightly , forcing all of them to squint painfully after having been in near darkness for several hours .
te	0	" I wasn 't present a thousand years ago and the data for that era has been long clouded by more pressing matters , " Hartman explains .
te	4	" Your ship ... or whatever ... is just in my range , but we need to get close and ... " " Wait ! "
te	1	The vat is filled with a thick green viscous material ; steam rising from the liquid fills the protected area with a light green mist .
te	1	" Sanctuary was not built with dragons in mind , but Doctor Hicks and Red have been busy converting it into a dragon medical bay . "
te	1	" Millions , maybe billions are dying right now as we speak ... and now it may never end ... unless I do something . "
te	4	" A dragon cortex can be easily converted , we just need to synchronize your brain to the biotech nodes of the dragon , " Hartman decides .
te	0	Floating near the spire is the TDF Samurai ; smaller vessels are attached to its hull , torch flashes indicating repairs underway to its damaged hull .
te	3	This particular stint at Holloway had run about two weeks now -- yes , thirteen days -- and he wasn 't even in gaol proper yet .
te	2	Somehow , the case against them would fall apart and onto the patsy 's shoulders , and Corbin was looking forward to the trial 's conclusion .
te	0	Once he 'd passed along this information , the boss had not only managed to squash the other gang , but also made them his patsy .
te	2	He 'd stopped across the hall with the visitor and one cell short of Corbin 's , and he wasn 't facing Corbin 's direction .
te	0	When he caught sight of David , his eyes widened and he tried to shout something , but one of others had a hand over his mouth .
te	4	Sure , he knew how to throw a punch if necessary , despite the fact that his profession was supposed to be a peaceful one .
te	3	Too dizzy to do much more than lurch unsteadily to his feet when the man he 'd jumped turned his attention back to Lewis Todd .
te	0	Briefly , he 'd thought they might decide Lewis was too much of a bother to haul away alive , and finish him on the spot .
te	4	" I 'd rather find a way out of here under our own steam than learn what it is these chaps have in store for us .
te	3	I left early to give testimony at court and returned home after I finished to fetch a few things before going to the station . "
te	1	( Almost as soon as the prisoner 's disappearance became known , the Islington division had attempted to claim jurisdiction , as Holloway fell under its auspices .
te	2	No amount of pounding or prying budged the solid wood , so the sergeant had suggested they allow their captors to open it for them .
te	0	With a sigh , Horace leaned forward and traced a finger down a small , framed portrait of Hildy that sat at the corner of his desk .
te	4	* * * * * In his younger years ( well , he still wasn 't very old ) , David Powell had been quite the cricketer .
te	3	The priest couldn 't tell whether their captors had expected them to burst from their prison ; he didn 't have time to think about it .
te	3	Then their hallway took a right turn , and then another right ... turning them back toward the main passage and their kidnappers and captivity .
te	4	The room was a different one , and light flickering through a small , oblong hole in one of the walls broke up the darkness .
te	1	Innocent had leaned over the slumbering policeman , his thick brows drawn in a pensive , thoughtful frown for a long moment before making his pronouncement .
te	0	The breeze always smelled like fresh hay and damp rocks and growing things , and the air hardly had a man-made sound upon it . "
te	3	The daylight in their cell faded to twilight and then night ; lamplight from the adjoining room splintered the darkness through the hole in the wall .
te	0	He could do what his friend had asked of him , at least in part , so he started forward with slightly more energy than an automaton .
te	4	Their awe had made him uncomfortable , so he 'd brushed it away by saying he 'd received extensive training as a child -- only partially true .
te	4	The evidence accompanying Nicholas Harker 's arrest was dazzling , and the trail of breadcrumbs that led from there to the witch 's house was spellbinding . "
te	1	" Another soul caught up in this mess , picked up by the same chaps who nabbed us , though his lot seems different from ours . "
te	3	" You tore a stitch or two throwing the boy about , " the priest explained as he sat down stiffly next to the pair .
te	4	Innocent 's answer -- that Uncle Conway had asked him to deliver a message to the police -- David repeated aloud for the bobby 's benefit .
te	0	This chamber 's secret was more ghastly : a large , rusty stain had marred the floor and painted macabre swirls in the clay dust before drying .
te	0	Not sparing his men more than a glance , Horace shouldered his way through the throng of heavies to follow the bobbing light into the darkness .
te	0	" For the good of -- " The prick of something hard and sharp under his chin forced the priest 's mouth shut with a snap .
te	3	And to Horace 's left , almost but not quite hidden in the shadows behind Todd and Powell and their guards , was the long-sought Nicholas Harker .
te	2	, and both Todd and Powell looked at each other in what could only be dismay before they both wrenched at their captors ' holds .
te	4	" Seems unlikely , " the inspector conceded , watching with concern as David Powell and Lewis Todd were loaded onto stretches for transport out .
te	0	The young woman was tall and quite pretty , had a brilliant crown of flaming ginger hair , and her smile and merry laugh were catching .
te	0	Her husband had been hanging back throughout this exchange , but now he drew up chairs for both of them and they sat down to converse .
te	0	I hazard he may be here a few days longer than I , what with broken ribs and three times as many stitches and all . "
te	4	Mathilda glanced over fondly to where her husband and the dark-haired young fellow were lost in some case file or another that Rory had brought .
te	2	When I was four , I sneaked into one of the trunks of our scullery maids ' son and took out a pair of dark maroon breaches .
te	2	I tried to keep strong , but looking at my poor , dying horse made me break down into a million tiny pieces of despair .
te	3	I hadn 't even given a thought to what I was to bring home to father , but maybe it was best that I hadn 't .
te	4	And I just might get a kick too , for there would be many people there who would be against the idea of inside pets .
te	3	The rain had stalled itself , but it wasn 't but a minute after I had left the safety of the tree that it started to pour .
te	0	My fingers came across a gooey patch of skin that hurt so terribly , my hand bounced off as if were attached to a bow .
te	3	It was swelling noticeably , and the circulation was sure to be cut off if I didn 't get it out from under the root .
te	0	But they probably hadn 't ever done anything like that ; Adda had probably never stepped on death 's doorstep , lucky to fall back off again .
te	4	maybe if I made everybody think I was absolutely content here , they would see their plan was not going to work and I would be released !
te	3	" Sometimes I just get the urge to get wet , since I don 't get no baths or nothin ' , " I said .
te	2	I broke the arrow off close to my skin , but I did not pull it out , because it would have caused excessive blood flow .
te	2	" John and Vincent come to dinner now , " shouts Victoria 's father from the kitchen table to his two sons in another room .
te	2	" Maybe this is a good thing , " says Steve sitting on one of the couches in the living room of Josh 's house .
te	1	The hallway is swarming with other students " Hey , " says a girl whom sits on the opposite side of my first period classroom .
te	2	I walk to the forgotten part of the school , down the hallway of despair and sadness and into the classroom where I first met Leo .
te	3	Leo picks up binoculars that I didn 't notice were right next to him on the ledge of the roof , and looks at the truck .
te	1	He looks at me then at Mrs. Snow and smiles as he goes through the classroom door backwards , smiling until the door finally closes .
te	3	She is wearing white pair of short shorts and short sleeve pink shirt that shows her tan lower back and stomach up to her belly button .
te	1	I 'm usually not one for dancing but something about the combination of a hot girl grinding her ass against me and beer make me .
te	0	" Nah bro go ahead , what 's up , " he says while I sit down in the seat across from him in the booth .
te	2	" You really don 't know what you 're getting yourself into , don 't you , " says Bruce looking straight ahead into space .
te	4	As your Student Body President I assure you those days are now over , there is no need to fear because today we are one .
te	0	There was no question about it , I was in fact falling for Kayla as the images and memories of Victoria were placed on the wayside .
te	3	I try to keep up with Leo as we attempt to get to the pickup zone in the back of the school before the trucks arrival .
te	3	That is only by technicality though because I know , Leo knows , and the rest of student body knows who was behind the attack .
te	1	His motives to scare us from rising against him , but we will not bend or concede to a man who will kill so easily .
te	0	" I really haven 't , thanks for taking me here , " Kayla says taking another sip out of her chocolate peanut butter marshmallow shake .
te	3	The only thing gotten out of the mission is a man named Jerry , thought to be one of the smartest in the school by Leo .
te	3	To get through the remaining months of the school year , our team 's primary goal has shifted to making sure other attacks don 't occur .
te	4	" At first it could have been because they were scared and believed or wanted to believe that giving into his threat will solve everything .
te	1	I never liked dancing , but I didn 't want Kayla , who is a senior to miss out on a memorable and special night .
te	2	" Bruce , that could work we could put some sort of tracker on you and , " I say before Bruce cuts me off .
te	4	The bartender places another full lager for Bruce and his driver , taking their empty glasses with her on her way back to the bar .
te	4	The physical and mental pain and being out for two weeks hasn 't given me the motivation or the time to care about my appearance .
te	4	When we finally reach my headquarters in the abandoned section of the school I take a seat at the desk of televisions in front of me .
te	0	He has a clean , neat , professional appearance , dressed up for the occasion , while I stand wearing cargo shorts and a blue t-shirt .
te	1	The Pyramid Company is major drug operation that uses the school delivery business as a front for their other illegal business , " he says .
te	4	He would come over the house , then I got assigned to look into the Pyramid Company in Miami , and I discovered his parents alive .
te	3	In it is a meeting room that takes over half the room with other offices on the opposite side of the hall taking up the other half .
te	0	" We had a deal , " he says as I open the door and walk into the room , assault rifle aimed at his head .
te	2	" Your right about one thing , you 're going to die , " he says grabbing my gun and throwing it across the room .
te	3	The helicopter with my entire body hanging with my hands clutched tightly to the landing skid move further and further into the distance from the Pyramid building .
te	1	Epilogue : 11 years later Victoria sits on an empty green lawn chair holding our first child , 2 month year old Tucker in her arms .
te	2	Victoria gets up , " I 'm going to get some food , did you want me to bring you back something , " she asks .
te	3	Smoothing the earth with his boot , he leaned across to stand the spade against the wall , and rested for a while , thinking .
te	3	That much was obvious the minute Spike had crashed through the door , pulled open a tatty carrier bag , and thrown the thing onto the table .
te	4	Grabbing a cloth , Duke wrapped it around the handle , pulled off the whistle , and poured boiling water into five cups of hot chocolate .
te	3	Then staring up at the leaden sky , she added , ' You don 't think it might be better to wait till the morning ? '
te	4	Almost immediately , Spike passed her two large items wrapped in a cloth , which slipped sideways as she held them , revealing two ornate candlesticks .
te	4	Several minutes passed as they huddled together , straining to hear any sound and then cautiously , Spike peeled back his hood and lifted his head .
te	0	' A crystal ball - ' Duke took it from Meatball 's hands and held it high in the air , straining to see beneath .
te	3	' Look at the way it catches the light - ' Slowly , she lifted it into the air and slid it onto her head .
te	1	If he 'd seen them and was now in hiding , waiting for them to draw near ... But they saw no sign of him .
te	3	In a desperate attempt to stay calm , Duke held his head in both hands , as if stilling it might calm his thumping heart .
te	1	' I ... I didn 't think - ' Duke wiped beads of sweat from his forehead with his hand , smearing it into his hair .
te	3	But somehow I didn 't think they 'd be that big ... ' ' No sign of him , ' Meatball interrupted , looking about him .
te	4	Quickly they retrieved their coats from the hiding place behind the rock and passed them around , then they walked back down the gloomy stone passageway .
te	3	They still said nothing ; the kindling was sparking and crackling and as flames started to lick around the logs , they sat staring into it .
te	4	Meatball stood up and then with a look across at Duke , he pulled something from his pocket and walked across to where Spike sat .
te	3	It says ... um ... ' The course of the fragment is certain ... it will strike the Earth in ten years after it orbits the star .
te	2	' Well , I don 't know really , ' Doc replied , with a shrug , ' I mean it doesn 't actually say .
te	1	Glancing around at four blank faces , she went on , ' Did any of you lot remember to put your brains on charge last night ? '
te	3	' You mean , ' Duke said , ' that ... that place we went this morning ... that could be sixty-five million years ago ? '
te	3	' And I suppose that 's not going to hurt us either , ' she said , watching as it flew off into the distance .
te	3	' Thank God they 've gone ... ' In front of the bushes , Meatball was still staring at the spot , almost daring something to appear .
te	3	Lofty and erect , two of them separated from the main party and stepped slowly past them to position themselves at the rear of the group .
te	4	He looked up ahead to where Ed was still trotting by the leader 's side and wished they could stop so he could give Ed a drink .
te	3	Terri bent down to add the little that remained in her bottle , then topped it with the dregs of the bottles offered by the others .
te	4	He pushed his hand deeper into it and then pulling it free , checked it and slowly sat himself into the centre of the cube .
te	3	' Don 't think they 'd be too worried about a baseball bat , ' Duke murmured , still trying to peer through the door .
te	1	His mouth moved in jerks as the purple vein pulsed across his throat and almost simultaneously translated , ' I trust you have all rested ?
te	3	' I mean , the fact that he 's not bothered ... maybe ... ' They fell silent , trying to calm their beating hearts .
te	4	They swung around to see a second creature , similarly dressed , with a smaller and slightly rounder head , pierce the surface of the wall .
te	4	' But the dream ... ' He answered her , his head nodding slowly all the while , as if it was out of his control .
te	2	We only ask that should you locate him , you will spare a moment to say the words we give you as a blessing . '
te	0	' And wash your face and hands , ' said Terri , ' you can 't go meeting that Grim Reaper bloke looking all grubby . '
te	4	The outside door of the coal hole was old , rusted , and hardly ever used and it took three of them to prise it open .
te	4	Wrapping their scarves around their faces to minimise the clouds of breath , they moved quickly , with as little noise as they could manage .
te	4	SIXTEEN The Storm The following morning , Spike stood on Terri 's doorstep and pressed the bell , listening as the chimes resounded down the hallway .
te	2	They had no reason to suppose it would , Doc had pointed out , no reason it should have moved any quicker than their own .
te	1	' It sounds as though it 's right above our heads now , ' Duke said , staring at the ceiling for signs of vibration .
te	0	From the base of the disc several narrow columns appeared , sprouting upwards to waist height and then fanning outwards to form a circular rail .
te	1	' Like when you 're standing on a station and you can 't see the express train , but you know it 's coming in . '
te	0	The train now standing at Platform four ... ' Halfway along the carriage , a door opened and a boy stepped out onto the icy platform .
te	2	' Bit of a long shot , ' he said amiably to the man behind the counter , ' I 'm looking for this man .
te	1	* At that moment , in a different time and place , Spike would 've given a king 's ransom to know for sure about anything .
te	4	' Well , no , ' Duke intervened hurriedly , ' it 's not that we thought you were dead exactly , it just seemed a possibility .
te	1	To his horror , it slipped away from the dampness of his palm and flew open , striking the wall behind it with a crash .
te	3	Bursting from the cellar , they poured up the stairs , onto the landing and into one of the rooms at the front of the house .
te	3	Spike strode across to the grassy mound and perched on the top to get a better view , looking out on a landscape that was completely still .
te	4	Unable to stop themselves , they rolled over and over on the floor , Billy flipping completely , coming to rest by Meatball 's head .
te	0	' Do me a favour , Spike , ' Meatball mumbled later , as his head hit the total bliss of a soft warm pillow .
te	0	And sometimes possessing such an ability may mean you are vulnerable in other areas , but make no mistake ... ' She glanced around at them all .
te	3	" And if she has lied about everything that led to the Red Knight 's death , then that makes this fate only more appropriate . "
te	4	Robbed of the swift and merciful execution I 'd anticipated , I found myself at a crossroads on the verge of torments I couldn 't imagine .
te	2	My bronze complexion might have fooled someone into thinking I was a hard worker , but the smoothness on my body up and down gave me away .
te	3	Although I regretted it even as I did it , this was still part of the plan , and I couldn 't let fear rule me now .
te	1	I let him go so far as to put his visor up higher , tipping my mouth upward as our lips joined for a tentative kiss .
te	2	Gorgeous as you are , I don 't think I 'm willing to lose my life for a false promise , no matter how ... tempting . "
te	4	Chapter 4 They practically danced as they walked , and even when standing or sitting still , they always seemed on the verge of motion .
te	3	We rounded the bump of the hill and I gasped at the rocky ridge that sort of thrust out of the earth like a dirty fingernail .
te	0	My goal for the day had rapidly changed from ' Find glory and slay the enemy ' to ' Try not to die , Naji . '
te	0	" When I first saw you naked and beautiful bathing in the waterfall pool , I didn 't know you had such a mouth on you . "
te	0	In the fog I didn 't have a prayer of hitting an exposed gap in a knight 's armor , but a horse made a decent target .
te	2	From a logical standpoint my plan could work , but the odds against us would have had Drake trying to convince me out of it .
te	4	The Black Knight was relentless though , and he picked up his opponent 's fallen sword , thrusting for the exposed gap between the breastplate and helm .
te	0	So I have to ask the most beautiful , kind , brave , and amazing woman I know one simple question : Will you marry me ? "
te	3	Why was it that the very man who probably knew the least about the act of conceiving had the sacred responsibility of blathering on about it ?
te	4	When I 'd been condemned for killing the Red Knight , I think part of me had been glad to finally have relief from the royal stage .
te	3	I made sure that my heart was still beating and that the words coming out of my mother-in-law 's mouth were in a language I understood .
te	0	She reached out a hand to catch a wisp of hair which had strayed from the simple ponytail I 'd insisted on for the wedding .
te	4	The suspicion in my eyes must have evaporated , because I found myself reaching out to clasp one of her frail hands in two of mine .
te	4	He wasn 't sure that the assassins here wouldn 't have a change of heart , and he was willing to risk Bronwyn over me .
te	2	Just a point of fact , it 's very hard to pull off red eyes without looking creepy , and this ogre was no more fortunate .
te	2	I promise you , if you 'll let me go free , that I will go to your people and make the Black Kingdom your ally .
te	0	I gave him a gaze of steel that said if it was about anything else , he was going to lose a significant piece of his anatomy .
te	2	Of my father , who 'd torn open my heart the day I found out he would not try to defend me in front of the Conclave .
te	1	" Give me the short version and add in the really juicy parts , " I said , trying to lighten up an awful situation .
te	0	" My grandfather was a young boy the last time we had to fight off such an onslaught , and back then it was different .
te	3	This easy , flat part of the journey would last the better part of the day , but after that it was a rough road .
te	4	I gave Bronwyn a look more menacing than a barrage of throwing knives as I dismounted and led my horse to the cool , glittering blue water .
te	1	Our alliances with most of the races who live in the mountain ranges encircling the Black Kingdom ... we have him to thank for solidifying them .
te	3	What it sounded , more like , was that Bronwyn was eager to distract me from the fear steadily beating its drum in my chest .
te	3	The sergeant patiently kept shouting at the man , and the men next to him shook him to try to wake him from his trance .
te	3	Growing up as a princess of the White Kingdom , my tutors had taught me about all the artifacts of power which my Father had inherited .
te	0	I roared a battle cry of my own as my sword cut a satisfying gap through several layers of swaying vine that stood between us .
te	3	During my time blacked out the knights had gotten us onto the horses and made good distance to get us clear of the forest path .
te	2	" Or I will attack you , and you will have no choice but to turn on your own Queen and forever be dishonored for it . "
te	2	Pounding the earth with her plated boots , she was on me too soon , looming like a shadow with the words Die , puny human !
te	4	I 'd just recovered feeling in my arms and legs when Selene grasped me by my ankles and lifted me up , dangling me like a worm .
te	2	Two long , gaping furrows tore canyons through his face , and what passed for a nose looked more like the snout of a feral beast .
te	0	There were many intimidating things about an ogre 's size , and being a few heads taller than any human was definitely a big part of it .
te	0	I felt barbed arrowheads beat harmlessly against my armor , but my heart lurched at the idea that my horse might not have been as lucky .
te	4	" I seem to remember someone fitting your exact description coming out of the mountains at the head of an ogre army larger than anyone expected .
te	2	What did you say when your mother-in-law sat like a ghost in a shadowy throne room at night and nearly terrified you out of your wits ?
te	3	That 's what happens when you assume that the end justifies the means without looking at the long term picture or what 's inside your heart . "
te	4	He stretched his arms , feeling the metallic exoskeleton hum as the joints slid along the well-oiled combat suit that hugged his body like a second skin .
te	0	Damian swore , diving for cover as he took Mr. Robles down hard alongside him , aware of the table blowing apart into shards and splinters .
te	3	Finally , satisfied that the man underneath him wouldn 't so much as twitch , Damian stood up and turned to speak to his unlikely rescuer .
te	3	The apartment doors which Damian flitted past were probably locked , and he didn 't want to barge into one random room after the next .
te	0	That girl has one word written all over her , and it starts with a capital T. " Damian slammed his hand on the stall 's surface .
te	1	Jenson leaned on the counter beside him , swiping two mugs and pouring two helpings with a grace that disgusted Damian this early in the morning .
te	4	The syn bosses will send their guys to Beta to put the heat on someone , but they don 't do business here in Beta Sector .
te	2	If only he 'd shut the stupid door ... their programming forbade them to enter someone 's personal living quarters without some physical sign for provocation .
te	4	" I know you 've come for papers , and I have papers , " she continued , waving a syringe in her free hand .
te	0	" If you recall , the court will determine your living situation and whether it has taken on aspects of a marriage , " Paul said .
te	4	With an apartment on the top floor of the ISE building , he often ordered meals for himself and his children when duties prevented him from cooking .
te	3	Thunderstorms were a frequent visitor to the Observatory during the summer months and this July was turning out to be one of the most active yet .
te	4	As Paul got the propane stove lit and got water on for coffee , Amanda stood sheepishly beside him as they both smiled at each other .
te	4	As they came around the bend in the river , a fishing lodge appeared on the left bank , and a boat ramp on the right .
te	2	If it looks clear , we 'll camp here tonight , float to town early in morning and head out south towards Boise , " Paul said .
te	3	Luckily I got to the store right after the lights went out with cash and bought enough supplies for the trip , " Desmond said .
te	4	The Idaho Governor had found him living quietly in retirement in Burley and had convinced him four years ago that his services were needed by the state .
te	3	With the gravy train stopped , they 'll be out looking to take and take , only now with a gun , " Ed said .
te	0	John and Isaac had worked up the ruse for Brittany that their grandfather had taken ill and that they needed to head to Idaho right away .
te	4	Since Bruneau was south of the Snake River in desert country , there weren 't any nearby population centers to contend with in a crisis .
te	3	" Mary still didn 't want any part of it , but I got the kids all loaded and on their way before I told her .
te	0	Ed was antsy to get to National Guard Headquarters , and upon arrival , discovered that the governor had convened a meeting of all his top officials .
te	2	All of our efforts over the past four years will amount to a hill of crap if the criminals take over , " the governor said .
te	1	An area stretching from Minnesota through Michigan , Illinois , New York , Maryland and New England had state governments that put their faith in Federal action .
te	0	" As you 'll recall , Sid was my Science Advisor and was instrumental in getting many of the protections in place that we have .
te	1	Might I suggest a top person here that might be willing to fill in until a new science advisor is named , " Ed said .
te	4	After ' the Pulse ' , the Governor had immediately declared martial law for the state , so anyone disobeying the law could be incarcerated immediately .
te	1	But unlike Idaho and other parts of the Intermountain West , Eugene was now in the hands of individuals conditioned by years of government handouts .
te	0	I would also acknowledge representatives from North Carolina , Arizona , Virginia , West Virginia , Nevada , Ohio , Indiana , Oregon , and California .
te	2	As you know , we have radio operators in different parts of the country and the world reporting on conditions in their area , " Ed said .
te	1	The Governor of Virginia , being closest to Washington , D.C. , answered , " When ' the Pulse ' hit , Washington turned into anarchy .
te	3	" We sent our state 's militias into Virginia to help hold back the wave of gangs trying to get out of the hellhole they had created .
te	3	" My friend said that the Indonesians have made it plain that they 've come to stay and that we can just move or die . "
te	4	" You don 't expect to need them for the opening moves though , so they 'll have more time to increase their ready status . "
te	3	I am confident many other states will feel the same about putting Texas or any other state into a dominant position , " the Idaho governor added .
te	3	" To my compatriot from Texas , I want to point out Dr. Kendall mentioned no state in his reference to ' commercial interests ' .
te	4	They had all been training together now for three months , and the combination of experienced veterans teamed with his young troops was working well .
te	3	The gangs tried once to come up into the mountains , but they didn 't try a second time , if you know what I mean . "
te	4	The bridges leading into eastern Oregon had been blown , cutting this area off from any refugee drift from the large cities to the west .
te	4	Western Australia , Queensland and the Northern Territories held a huge reservoir of metals waiting to be scooped up and shipped to factories in Asia .
te	4	He described how fighting with your mates was the essence of life itself and that the rest of his existence on earth paled in comparison .
te	2	Noel saw from the facial expression that the major was about to unload , but in good Allied cooperation mode , he held it in .
te	4	And since our military has been progressively shrunk over the years , no Kiwi has won one since 1945 , " the Kiwi commander explained .
te	0	Along with absentee ballots that were questionable , that Democratic idiot Al Franken won a narrow victory , " a delegate from South Dakota chuckled .
te	4	He pointed out that the United States had been unique in the world in conferring citizenship on anyone who happened to be born in the U.S. .
te	2	Are you saying we should throw out all those people who through no fault of their own , are now living here , " Rebecca shouted .
te	2	" Too many people looking for a handout from the government , and he stood at the head of the line promising them the world .
te	0	Chairman Z dug into the ground as close as he could and was hit by the hot air being pushed ahead of the bomb blast .
te	0	When they were finally alone in their raft , Amanda said , " Couldn 't you figure out what I was trying to say ? "
te	3	Julie and I have spent a little too much time in the old hot water tub out on the back pasture , " John said .
te	1	" I 've been running rivers since I was six years old you know , " Amanda proceeded to announce , to no one in particular .
te	0	The one on the right then pulled up his shirt to reach for this , " John said as he lifted the man 's shirt .
te	3	" I 'll take the lead with the two women in the Caprice so they don 't have to look at our load , " Paul said .
te	4	With over two hundred million Indonesians before ' the Pulse ' , they had sufficient numbers of people to displace the four million New Zealanders .
te	0	Maybe you young guys are good for something after all , " GG said as he handled the extra assault rifles and ammo off to the team .
te	3	" Yes , after the U.S. Constitution was fully passed by all thirteen states , other nations began to examine what the U.S , had done .
te	2	No , we were losing with Canada and Mexico , too , in the amount of $ 93 billion a year going across our borders .
te	0	If we can get our new country stabilized and on track , we may all look back on the CME as a godsend , " Lars added .
te	2	I know the problems the country got into with all the borrowing , but I think other solutions can be found , " Vernon said .
te	4	Paul and his party were settling in for a long wait when a loud yell from the back alerted them that they had been spotted .
te	3	But just in case the bridges were blown , the East Force was ready to split in two and add weight to the southern attack .
te	3	With the use of a garden cart and accompanied by the thug who knew sailing , the small party made their way to the Seattle waterfront .
te	4	As he and General Gale walked in , Ed took up a position against the wall while Fuller sat down in front of the prisoner .
te	3	A buzz went up through the clamor of battle and Noel saw the dirt flying up as bullets tore holes in front of the charging troops .
te	4	As he got ready to be wheeled down to the waiting truck , Noel 's father , Desmond , and his Grandfather Leslie stepped into the room .
te	1	* * * " OK , bring in the next four , " Mr. Wong told Johnny as four men climbed the gangway onto the ship .
te	4	A leader of a pack of thugs had to keep them under control - the ' Alpha ' dog theory of life , he recalled from somewhere .
te	0	Our old friend , Horst , quickly gathered up his minions and along with Oklahoma and Louisiana , walked out of the Convention , " Amanda said .
te	4	When the Idaho governor finally answered Ed 's inquiry as to the cargo that they would be responsible for , there was a moment of stunned silence .
te	3	" If the governors haven 't gotten through to all the air units to stay away from this train , the boys with the Stingers will . "
te	3	Ed notified the troops that friendly air assets were in the area and to act accordingly , but he cautioned them to maintain vigilance just in case .
te	4	With a return to an orderly society , computers would once again rule citizen 's lives , but hardened this time from any future CME .
te	4	The rich already make sure their ' boys ' are elected to the Senate , and to the House , and to the White House .
te	2	Ed loaded on , " Now the only thing I 'm here to discuss is how fast your sorry asses can get out of my country . "
te	2	With you now in a position in the government , it would be compromising if they fell into the wrong hands , " Ed offered .
te	3	The first is the existing one on the West Coast of North America , from the tip of Baja north to Eureka , California . "
te	3	" And if we don 't state our policy right now , then ignorance on their part might make that decision easier for them to make .
te	4	The airmen of the 8th Air Wing of the UAS Air Force listened intently in their ready room at the air base located at the Reno Airport .
te	4	They had to pull the missiles from the silo , remove the nukes and then transport them to Florida for launch , " the commander said .
te	0	As Commander of Task Force Delta , he had fought across the State of Washington and was ready to take his Montana and Idaho volunteers into battle .
te	0	" Besides , I hear through the grapevine that Commander Z and that bitch woman of his are back at it in the Bay area .
te	3	We have to get things started right for the nation to have a chance at returning to the great country it once was , " Paul said .
te	0	As such , the house had a number of guns that would normally have been illegal for common citizens under Maryland 's tough gun laws .
te	1	If you followed our progress , you know that suppressing the gangs and bringing security for the survivors has been our priority , " Paul said .
te	0	So Paul 's only companion was a cargo bay full of strapped down supplies that was deemed vital to the battle taking place in the Golden State .
te	2	" I don 't know , Sergeant , but it does look like my brothers wife 's sisters husband , if you follow all that .
te	1	" Look , I 'll admit to being Chairman Z , but I don 't know who this Dwight character is , " the man said .
te	3	He continued with the litany of Texas history from its beginning as part of Mexico up to the day it walked out of the Constitutional Convention .
te	3	" We don 't need to go back to the 19th Century to understand how America rose to the top of all the nations in the world .
te	3	She went on to explain that as the other countries rebuilt and became more competitive , the United States didn 't adjust to the new situation .
te	3	To get the National Council approved , the other side made sure that the ' Defense of Marriage Act ' was incorporated into the constitution .
te	1	The small remaining portions of the old Departments of Transportation , Education , Housing and Urban Development , Agriculture and the Environment were now under Interior .
te	3	But the thought of losing the ' gold standard ' and reverting back to a ' fiat money ' system persuaded the majority to accept the deal .
te	2	The FWF , as it would be called , would be an association of western-style countries that could find common ground in which they could cooperate .
te	0	Chapter 39 North Shore , Oahu , Hawaii The Battle of San Francisco , as recorded , was as bloody and destructive as had been predicted .
te	2	I know I can speak for my colleague from New Zealand in expressing our profound gratitude for what your country has provided to our two countries .
te	2	Noel had found an empty bed and although his injuries didn 't warrant a hospital stay , his concern for the major overshadowed official protocol .
te	3	Amanda had left strict instructions with her brother that she didn 't want to see anyone and it took some male bonding to get Paul an answer .
te	3	Corbyn 's business revolved around studying current sunspot activity and then comparing that information to a point in history with a similar sun spot activity pattern .
te	2	" We 're going to be on here for a few days so I would prefer you not be too childish if you can help it . "
te	2	She pushed open one door , looking around the strange walls that connected one train car to the next with a floor for them to walk on .
te	3	I would also talk to myself , starting with ' A ' and trying to say every word I could think of up to ' Z ' .
te	2	" Once you learn to change from one form to the other , you will be put through tests to see how good your control is . "
te	4	" A file I think you should read , " replied Hiro as one screen blinked and then a wave of words spilled through it .
te	0	" I could almost call this laptop my brother more than I can call my parents Mom and Dad , if I had any . "
te	2	She stared hard out the window , ignoring Hiro who watched her a moment longer before lying on the bench and kicking off his boots .
te	0	As soon as she was inside she laughed out loud over the murmuring of conversation and stood near an unfamiliar man who had black hair .
te	2	" You haven 't stopped looking wary of everyone since I woke you up , " Soul told Hiro , making him glance at her .
te	3	" I 'll try this tea if you tell me , " he said , tapping the table with the teaspoon to make Soul look at him .
te	0	She glanced up at him in confusion and saw him cast a wary glance at the window before leading her out of the dining car .
te	0	He looked ahead and saw the train was indeed coming to a stop , but it was on a bridge over top of a large lake .
te	4	Shaking her head , Soul looked around again , seeing the bedroom was elegant and that there was a fine wood door that led into the house .
te	3	No one figured out that it was the crystal itself , the heart they had given him , that was causing Hiroshima 's downfall itself . "
te	4	" You and your brother are both in danger because Anna decided to fix your heart problems and use you to reach her own goals . "
te	1	Anna threw her arms up and her bodyguards dove in front of her to save her , but Shadow Eater vanished from in front of her .
te	1	" You killed him , " he said , lifting his head and pointing at the puncture wound in his throat that oozed blood and black oil .
te	2	There was suddenly a loud crackling sound and Soul looked up to see bolts of electricity shooting from Shadow Eater 's hand into Crystal Crier 's side .
te	0	He pushed back the hood of his cloak and his short blond hair caught the light of the fire climbing the walls of the house .
te	0	It 's hard to escape her , let alone doing it while carrying a half-human machine and leading a young lady who has a weak system . "
te	0	He stood with his back to them , his arms at his sides , and his black hair windswept from the energy he had used .
te	0	" If I can 't hear Crystal Crier anymore I want to know if I still take on the same massacre form as I used to .
te	1	" Well , it 's because you ruined the mood , " replied Hiro , laughing again at his words then stopping hastily with a blank stare .
te	3	" I just meant - " " I know , don 't worry about it , " Hiro interrupted , patting Soul 's hand before taking it .
te	1	He tightly shut his eyes , gritting his teeth as tears rolled down his face , mingling with the raindrops that dripped from his hair .
te	2	The barge pulled into the harbor and instead of dropping a lifeboat to row to shore , Anna made Hiro swim while following close behind him .
te	3	Hiro didn 't trouble himself with pointing out that he wouldn 't need rest any more than she would , but he thought better of it .
te	1	Hiro approached , looking inside and finding a long steel tunnel with orange and red lights lining the ceiling and a staircase that led down into it .
te	4	Hiro seized her by the throat and lifted her into the air , then slammed her to the ground so hard the earth cracked at impact .
te	1	He had seen it go flying when Anna changed into her second form and Hiro went to it , picking it up and dusting sand off it .
te	0	Somewhere in the back of his mind he thought he heard Soul 's laugh and he lowered his head , placing his hand over his heart .
te	0	He used his fund to finance his global trotting and last year , he announced , he was going around Southeast Asia to look for supernatural entities .
te	0	It was a soft raspberry colored hooded jacket that always makes me feel just as comfy and cozy as if I was back in my own bed .
te	2	" By the way , Pamela can I give you a word of advice if it 's okay for me to tell you one ? "
te	2	I would really love to know more about what he did here ... " I said before taking a spoonful of the porridge into my mouth .
te	1	The closeness of our bodies was intoxicating and had it been a different situation , I wouldn 't wait for him to make a move .
te	3	You should understand that there are things in this world that we have to learn to accept and respect in order for us coexist . "
te	4	" If you ever go to the Arizona , or anywhere near me in the United States , I 'll take you there to the canyons . "
te	2	Then we dock in ports in the US too so I get a couple of days off to sight see and stay in hotels in America . "
te	0	Lanie brought out her tablet again and read a line from a blog saying , " The nymph is also said to appear mostly after a storm .
te	0	Jared , a young farmer from a small isolated village , has paid scant attention to the distant troubles until his younger siblings are taken as slaves .
te	4	Superstition Gold Married and widowed within a 24-hour period , beautiful Leigh Banning watches as her storybook New Orleans life crumbles away piece by piece .
te	0	Leigh 's quest for justice leads her to a remote Apache camp in the company of a proud Pima Indian and a handsome cavalry officer .
te	4	Romance - Contemporary Lightning Strikes Jessie Evans is a free-lance journalist , emphasis on the " free , " with no plans to tie herself down .
te	3	I don 't know what I thought would happen to me , but I just know I really didn 't want to find out . "
te	3	Science still doesn 't know to what extent our subconscious minds pick up stuff , what we take in and store without even realizing it .
te	3	" But really , Dad , " she said , returning to the original subject , " you 've got to admit there 's something to it .
te	0	" I always said he had a mind like a steel trap , " Brian joked , " closed up tight and rusty as hell . "
te	2	He called to Ross and the two men followed the prints , accompanied by one set of boot tracks , to another set of horse prints .
te	3	Here the dirt was patterned with hoof marks , as if a man sat a restive horse that would not be still and held another .
te	3	" If you don 't get that rail down in the next two seconds , we 're leaving without him , " Ash said angrily .
te	0	He ruled his kingship with the family of his one true son , Mal , and his second wife who had her own son , Bren .
te	4	His mother 's face sagged at the mention of her younger children , as if she folded in on herself under the weight of her returning grief .
te	3	He looked about at the ruin that was his village and thought more about facing the king 's animals that had brought about the destruction .
te	3	Having that one down left Matt with only two units unreserved for the day , so it would be first come , first served for those .
te	3	Her small stature might fool someone at first , but people quickly found out that if Susie had a problem , it would be dealt with .
te	3	" How is it , " he asked , " that you know the exact moment I have time to even think about lunch ? "
te	4	Whether they went out or stayed in at either his place or hers , he couldn 't remember the last Saturday night he 'd spent without her .
te	3	Granted , they don 't slow down much , but enough so that Susie , Simon and I can handle it without a problem . "
te	0	At his sheepish look , she leaned closer and added , " Don 't worry ; that 's a trait I find highly admirable . "
te	3	When they 'd first started dating she had thought Matt was driven and ambitious , a combination she was not sure she could meld with .
te	1	She knew he wasn 't as keen about this as she was ; he was still angry about being assigned to this rural sales route .
te	0	Converted to a garage decades ago , it also had a second room that ran the length of the garage with large windows and a slate floor .
te	1	" Why my brain insists on climbing back onto that hamster wheel and rehashing the whole thing over and over again , I 'll never know .
te	3	To find out it wasn 't that way at all ... well , it just makes me wonder what else I 'm not seeing clearly .
te	4	I think it 'll be a wonderful interim for you , a time when you can relax and just enjoy yourself and recharge your batteries .
te	4	" We were touring the camp , " she told Theo , " and I noticed I was getting a weird prickly sensation inside my head .
te	1	In the dimming twilight they came like ghostly devils from hell , loosing death with every arrow , surrounding the wagons in a fiendish shrieking circle .
te	0	Any man who had found his fortune in California or any man not willing to travel as far as the west coast hurried eagerly to the Platte .
te	0	That particular spring had about it a crispness and a newness that seemed to act as a catalyst on my boredom , making it almost unbearable .
te	1	Since my graduation from Mrs. Pettit 's Finishing School , I had little to occupy my time so I paced or stared out my window .
te	3	I imagine many of the older women thought me a cold child with little empathy or gratitude , but I cared very little what they thought .
te	0	My grandfather 's wealth was well known , so I was duly inspected by the proper suitors , usually at parties or other large affairs .
te	2	Mrs. Pettit had done all in her power to correct this horrible fault , had vowed that she would do so or have a nervous breakdown trying .
te	2	I had often thought of how I might make my way to the prairie but I had almost no idea of how to do it .
te	3	Since it wasn 't to leave until the following day , I rented a room in a hotel and stayed there until time to depart .
te	0	I was closer to my homeland than I had been in seven years and I had escaped New York and all its constrictions with hardly a problem .
te	1	Painted stark white , it was imposing in its structural simplicity and I agreed with Melly that it had once been a very fine house .
te	3	If I had my way , I would take a horse and ride straight out of town , out onto the prairie , but that was impossible .
te	2	The male boarders , I knew , would require more time to get to know , so I tried not to form opinions right away .
te	0	He began to walk toward the back as he talked , and I followed him to where bolts of cloth lay haphazardly on a table .
te	3	The man 's abruptness was something I would have to get used to , although I preferred that to the insincerity typical of most people .
te	2	Oh God , oh God , oh God ... She felt her sex opening up to him , allowing -- no inviting -- him to probe inside .
te	4	" I heard the first time was usually not very good , " he said happily , " but I guess that doesn 't apply to everyone .
te	0	They thought they had left their capable daughter in a predictably stable life , and in less than a day it had fallen into rubble .
te	4	Leigh quickly relieved her of it and walked slowly back to her window seat , waiting to hear the door click shut before tearing open the envelope .
te	1	Davis was on his feet as soon as the first tear fell , and he put comforting arms around Leigh as she poured out her sorrow .
te	3	" I know it 's not much , but if there 's anything I can do ... " " How can she do that ? "
te	1	If it weren 't for the haphazard distribution of pick-up trucks and visitor 's cars , she could easily imagine herself a thousand years in the past .
te	4	" Why , you -- you -- " " Save it , " he said , pocketing the business card along with the appropriated memory card .
te	3	This time not only did her contact not show at all , but what did show was a disrespectful , ill-mannered ... She shook her head .
te	0	Roy 's wife , Dianne , was a born and bred poor little rich girl , or at least that was what Jessie had heard .
te	0	Most of the whites that came to watch the ceremonial dances were grass-roots American tourists , tall and skinny Californians or short and round Nebraskans .
te	0	It had been exactly that reaction that had made him want to catch the back of her head in his large hand and pull her to him .
te	4	Emotionally , she felt like Alice in Wonderland , fallen down a rabbit hole and unable to get back or even to see where she fell from .
te	1	Try as she might , she could summon up no names , no faces , no emotions except the confusing ones struggling inside of her right now .
te	4	Whatever synapse that had broken down to cause her memory lapse was apparently not disrupting her other cranial functions , and she tested out perfectly normal .
te	2	The good news is that your concussion is not as bad as it could be , and you can go home in a day or two .
te	4	His gaze swept her , caressing her silken skin , then looking back into her eyes as if he 'd just remembered there was a head attached .
te	0	The long escarpment of cooled lava was a maze of air pockets and tunnels , all frozen in time as the lava had congealed to rock .
te	4	Almost fifty people lived in the Ruins and the elder women cooked for them all in the great kitchen that Pat said used to feed thousands .
te	3	Although Pat spoke sparingly and kept silent most of the time , it was not difficult to know her thoughts ; at least not for Grace .
te	4	They came for news of the Sibling , beseeching Pat to tell them when and how her fabled sister Greer would come to deliver them from darkness .
te	3	Not that she 'd wanted to , but the proper taking of the life of another of the Goddess ' creatures was a critical responsibility .
te	1	" Oh , Goddess , whose light and creations are beautiful , I thank You for this animal who will die for me so I may live .
te	4	The strangers ' lips , already tinged with the first of what would probably be several cocktails before the day was out , met her face .
te	1	Julie turned her head at the sound of the sliding glass door , and saw Greg , smiling , with two glasses in his hand .
te	4	Julie knew and liked the girl , even though she was jealous of her orange hair and the trail of freckles that ran down her neck .
te	0	The plan was to turn off at the first pang of hunger and rely on back roads with quaint names for as long as possible .
te	0	Kim got a decent enough spot , and they passed a woman with a walker and her patient husband as they made their way up a ramp .
te	4	A row of booths featured mothers cutting chicken fingers into even smaller pieces while the eventual eaters splashed apple juice upon placemats adorned with local advertisement .
te	4	Julie was relieved to find a slab of stone that could serve as a seat , and she got off her feet at the first chance .
te	3	And she could see to that , it would translate into enjoyable stays that would linger in the memory and beckon a return at the first shot .
te	3	This was what he really tasted like , and Julie fought the urge to vomit " It 's just a little secondhand smoke , Jules .
te	0	She curled into a fetal position and folded her arms around her vulnerable frame as she tried to crawl as far as the chains would allow .
te	3	Julie couldn 't comprehend what he was alluding to , but it promised to be something so harsh that it would rival her present state of confinement .
te	0	It was all too apparent that it was a futile wish , and Julie closed her eyes and prayed for this to be a nightmare .
te	3	All she could do was look at Kim and try to convince her that they would get away at the first chance , whenever that might be .
te	2	Matt had gone out of his way to rival Kim 's second of pleasure with his own need to control her and bring distress to the fore .
te	3	This time , he wasn 't a fantastical savior with the power to descend from white clouds and spirit her from the grip of the lying pair .
te	3	After all that had happened , Julie knew Pete better , but it was just as easy to picture Matt in the driver 's seat .
te	4	So maybe Pete was the wild card , the one that suppressed his true self in an effort to put the pair of potential captives at ease .
te	3	She wasn 't sorry that she hurt him , but she was devastated by the fact that it was all she had been able to do .
te	4	Low music , the television in his bedroom set at a low hum , half a bottle of Nyquil , an entire bottle of wine .
te	1	Not one thing on the desk gave any indication of his past or his present , and Ethan 's future promised well-organized anonymity in the same vein .
te	4	Perhaps it was a lesson passed down from his late father , or maybe the senior McCord had made the mistake of assuming that bigger meant better .
te	0	An outline of his day-to-day would only serve to make him appear pathetic in Carter 's eyes , and neither Ethan nor Arcadia could afford that idea .
te	2	It only took a quick glance at a leather-bound book for him to leap into action and show the previously uninvited guest towards the elevator .
te	4	When Geoffrey kissed her new and improved face , he did so with total love , and Ethan felt that the picture in the penthouse was complete .
te	4	He appeared to revel in the denizens of his private kingdom as trays of cheese and crab cakes made their way to the table under gloved hands .
te	0	Julie was completely paralyzed as his fingers tangled with her hair , and he slightly lifted her head only to slam it down again and again .
te	4	Somehow she summoned the courage to stand , and as she kept Ethan 's jacket around her body , she pressed her ear to the closed door .
te	0	It could never erase what had happened to her , but Ethan was already thinking of a way to stop it from going any further .
te	4	Ethan 's new plan was to leave her to the others and excuse himself to take a breath of fresh air or a leak or whatever .
te	2	Resolving to prove as good as his word , Ethan opened the door and gently closed it with one last look at the damaged girl .
te	4	Each blow brought him back to the ground , and once he was on his knees , he could only wrap his arms around her bare legs .
te	3	Ethan gasped at the impact , but his arms remained on her wrists as they both fell to the ground and coughed into the dirt .
te	3	Not that Ethan hadn 't unknowingly dropped the clues , but that was hardly enough to jump to the conclusion that this was Ethan 's scene .
te	1	Disarm him and then force his way back into the night to beat him to a pulp , get his gun , and keep running .
te	4	Ethan started to speak , to reveal something that he had seen , but he fell back on the possibility of coincidence and let her keep going .
te	0	A part of her wanted to gag on the bread , but another part of her , a rapidly diminishing part , was just hungry .
te	2	In short order he would overpower Ethan and hack him to death or find a way back to his gun and blow his head off .
te	1	An ancient mug shot on account of a DUI in Florida showed a different face from the one now lying , restrained in a hospital bed .
te	0	Like a dog who 'd tasted a bone , his muzzle was wet with the hope of landing a millionaire and his spawn by association .
te	4	Geoffrey Troxel and Carter McCord were already launching a defense as this girl and the broken man down the hall spun tales of months of torture .
te	1	Morales didn 't protest his intentions even as she wanted to know how this had happened to two girls who planned a trip and found misery .
te	3	Julie tried to tell herself that Amanda didn 't mean it , that she was just shattered by what had happened to her little girl .
te	4	Except for the nurses that poured in to check on her and asked if she needed anything , Julie was all but abandoned in the darkness .
te	4	Other times , she was back in combinations of places that made little to no sense but were still preferable to the place where she was trapped .
te	3	And the fact that something had happened that turned his memory and his stomach at the sight of what she was being forced to do .
te	0	For a second , she thought she was losing him to a bad call , but then Ethan spoke as he clutched her hand tighter .
te	4	Julie was angry at what had been done to them , but Amanda Beyer 's drug-induced delirium aside , the trip was never of her design .
te	4	The space between the three rings was endless , and she wiped her eyes until his voice emerged on the other end of the line .
te	4	Her body stiffened some at the feel of his hand mingling with the memories of so many others , but he would never hurt her .
te	2	This wasn 't the bed she had envisioned , but her own room was too close to her parents and too full of memories of Kim .
te	3	Ethan inhaled the aroma of her attempt at breakfast , and one taste told Julie that she was triumphant as her own fork hit the meal .
te	4	Julie couldn 't help but take some satisfaction in his inhibited position , and she felt stronger still as she neared the edge of his bed .
te	3	Or did I knock that bit of intel from your puny -- " " But you said you might want a taste after they were done .
te	4	It was the last cry of the condemned , the found out , and Julie scoffed at the point of the shears against her already injured cheek .
te	3	He was strapped for a solution and could think of nothing better or easier than selling the little girl in his midst to the highest bidder .
te	4	When he shifted , Julie took her hand away and just watched him as he slept even as she wanted his voice in her ears again .
te	4	Many sighed in wonder of why she continued to run , hide , and had run away from the orphanage before she turned an adult age .
te	3	They were dirty and full of tears , but rather than complain of their ill condition , she was grateful to have anything opposed to nothing .
te	0	And that guard ... he may have fallen to his death ... I did that ... " " I hate being here in this cold place ! "
te	4	" With a prayer , a smallest whisper , hurt and lost , you will be found , you will see your inner most desire . "
te	0	Sylvia began to turn to run out of reaction , but her aunt placed a painful grip on her arm , and pulled her back .
te	3	She picked up a tall , thick stick that laid among other sticks from skinny to thick , but this one was the best to her .
te	1	" I have not seen many of them , but every now and then someone can stumble onto finding one , mostly in this area .
te	0	It took so long for him to realize that his father had only blamed him cause he couldn 't and wouldn 't face reality of what happened .
te	4	She fell back on the ground and threw an arm over her face as if she tried to grasp all that had just happened to them .
te	3	She had even thought that she would have died by starvation , if the bitter cold had not taken her down into an icy grave first .
te	3	It sped like lightning , traveling so fast that he couldn 't make out what it was until it plunged into the man 's wrist .
te	3	He was so distracted by the heavy flow of blood that quickly followed that Adam barely had to use any effort to finish the fight .
te	1	CHAPTER 3 " I have a diluted strain of morphine if you need it , " Tom Winston spoke as he finished bandaging Adam 's wound .
te	0	Tom knew , as Adam did , that Jim 's death and the resulting loss of backing for Adam as Commander would mean a hard road ahead .
te	0	Paul Cooke had been Adam 's right-hand man at the CSA for the last eight years , almost as long as Adam had been Commander .
te	0	Shouldn 't take long , " Paul said , patting a small bag that he carried on his shoulder that was full of medical supplies .
te	0	In his entire career , there was only one other that Adam had met who had it also ; that 's how rare it was .
te	3	But the only image that stuck in her head was the one of him sitting before her , bloodied and dying at the train station .
te	1	Dressed in black suit pants , a crisp white shirt , and a tailored black blazer , he fiddled with his tie in front of the mirror .
te	0	And , I sure as hell don 't care about that frigging chip on your shoulder over the fact that I became Commander and not you .
te	0	He , too , was dressed in his Sunday best for the funeral , wearing a tailored navy blue suit and a chapeau to match .
te	2	" Well , luckily for you , I had a plan on standby , " Adam said as he took his phone out of his suit pocket .
te	0	As soon as he hit the ground she was upon him , forcing her heel against his diaphragm to prevent him from getting back up .
te	3	It 's only by a stroke of luck that you succeed in battle , because you have neither clarity of thought nor the skill to win . "
te	3	" Tell me you didn 't fail , that that 's not what I 'm sensing from you , " Carl said with an eerie calm .
te	4	" We wait , " he repeated to ensure Joe got the message and then he turned abruptly on his heel and strode away coolly .
te	0	He unzipped his track jacket and hung it on the back of his desk chair so that he was just wearing a black wife beater .
te	4	He gulped , overcome by the heat between them , trying to fight his not-so-nice urges that he normally reacted on immediately with other women .
te	0	Barely over five-foot tall , he was a small , plump man with spiky black hair and a face that was never without rough stubble .
te	1	Rick 's favorite were the tactical gloves with knuckle armor , which enabled him to inflict maximum damage on his opponents without suffering any himself .
te	4	Despite it being autumn , the temperature had climbed to eighty degrees Fahrenheit so everyone was out making the most of the weather while they could .
te	4	Earphones in her ears , music turned up , with sunglasses shielding her eyes , she was in a reverie completely unaffected by the world around her .
te	4	Placing her music player in her shoulder bag along with her sunscreen and a couple of bottles of water , she was ready to leave .
te	0	" Rick , baby , let 's go for a swim , " she purred as she ran her hands all over his naked back .
te	3	A psychologist would probably tell him it was the tragic circumstances surrounding her death that made it so difficult for him to lay it to rest .
te	3	But knowing now what she did about the Syndicate , the CSA , and her own abilities , she couldn 't just return to mundane normality .
te	4	She didn 't know what had happened , but from the state he was in she wagered it was something to do with his wife .
te	3	But having tried and tested it now he found it only served to complicate and slow progress and strategy in an organization like the CSA .
te	0	Wearing black track pants , a sports bra , and a light windbreaker jacket , she followed the instructions the security guard had given her .
te	1	They are highly skilled , well-trained individuals , whose role it is to assist during certain aspects of the program such as combat training and field exercises .
te	4	It was the last day of the program , also known to the recruits as " dress down " day where they could wear their street clothes .
te	3	" At the same time , I don 't want you to be so afraid that you don 't draw on your instincts at all in battle .
te	4	But when he looked at her and saw the hunger in her eyes he couldn 't bring himself to do what he knew he should .
te	4	You were hoping I 'd show some remorse so you could finally let it go after all these years and get a good night 's sleep ? "
te	0	His right hand gripped his hair and slammed the back of his skull against the hard concrete floor , over and over , without mercy .
te	4	And then he dove over her , grabbed his gun off the side table beside her , and pulled her off the bed with him .
te	1	His fingertips dug into his flesh and he slammed the back of his head against the wall over and over again until he lost consciousness .
te	2	She shoved his arm away and took the opportunity to land a back kick to her other opponent , forcing him back against the bookshelf .
te	3	Without breaking his stride he fired off a fatal shot at one of the men blocking his path and then rushed out towards the gym floor .
te	4	He saw the agony on her face as he pressed his other hand to her side to steady her for what he was about to do .
te	0	" The problem is that a decision was made to launch an offensive against a small army which superseded the safer option of a retreat .
te	0	You and I may not always see eye to eye , but as far as I 'm concerned , your leadership abilities actually surpass Jim 's .
te	4	She was wearing her street clothes , so today had to be her day off , meaning she 'd come in just to see him .
te	0	" This isn 't about the win , you idiot , " she rasped , hunched over , with her hands resting on her thighs .
te	2	" Maybe , but can you be certain that I can 't fire off a shot at one of you before you shoot me ? "
te	3	" I don 't want to get into it , " he said , snapping back to reality and taking a gulp of his beer .
te	3	An ivory , low-cut tank drew attention to her ample cleavage , which was further accented by the contrast with her fitted black leather jacket .
te	3	Adam continued , " Rick used to assist her with protection , muscle , to put it simply , in exchange for a cut of the profits .
te	0	Rick shook off his jacket to reveal a white t-shirt that was completely soaked through with blood on the right side where Adam had shot him .
te	0	Frantically , he wrapped more gauze around it , slipped his jacket on , and forced himself to focus on the hazardous situation around him .
te	0	CHAPTER 52 Bill Palmer sat at his desk poring over some operational files for potential new recruits that Adam had faxed him earlier that day .
te	3	* * * * * Abbey stood back and watched Bill , Jeff , and Paul argue their situation with the receptionist and two heavyset security guards .
te	2	Obviously I have to fix it , my life , the problem is I don 't really trust anyone and I don 't know how .
te	4	If he had grabbed Gizmo and pulled him as he intended to do , he would have pulled Gizmo directly into the line of fire .
te	4	He pulled out Giselle 's first aid kit which wasn 't equipped to handle an emergency of this magnitude , so he would have to improvise .
te	3	I 'm still the pilot , but if something should happen to me , you will need to listen to Marco and do what he says . "
te	3	What he hadn 't told Giselle , and had no intention of telling her , was about the ' kill ' switch he had installed .
te	4	Sitting on the edge of the bed beside his wife , Ben felt it too , and reached out to caress the top of Gilbert 's head .
te	3	Since Gizmo hated to brush his teeth , but knew his mother insisted on it , he invented a toothpaste that could be used without a toothbrush .
te	4	He also programed in a homing algorithm that would bring him back home again no matter where , or when , he might eventually end up .
te	3	" Shouldn 't you let that to the space administration , or the government , or someone with a lot more experience with that kind of thing ?
te	2	Looking around , Gizmo was unsure where it had come from or if there were any more of its kind lurking around to ambush him .
te	4	The vibration in the ground , and the thundering sound of their hoofs hammering the terrain would generally give anyone sufficient time to seek shelter .
te	4	§ § § Marco 's people were more concerned about day to day survival than they were about whether they shared the universe with other intelligent life .
te	4	Marco was shaken when the alien stepped out of his vehicle wearing something on his head with a picture of one of his prime food sources .
te	3	Since its atmosphere was not particularly hospitable to most life forms , it was not a destination , or generally on the way to any known destination .
te	4	It would take centuries for his species to rise to even a minimal amount of awareness of intergalactic affairs , if in fact they ever do .
te	0	" Take as long as you like , but you will not be leaving The Colony until we have had a chance to talk again . "
te	1	So you see , you will not be going into the actual fighting , you will be going back in time before the fighting starts .
te	0	" What about if we arrange to have him adopted by a working class family who is unable to have a child of their own ? "
te	4	" Yeah , it would have to be at night when the hospital is quiet , and there are fewer staff who could see us .
te	0	As he backed out and slowly turned the car around on the cushion of air , Gizmo was frantically trying to figure out a plan of action .
te	4	Your activity will be restricted for the first week , and then if there have been no problems ; you can resume normal activity after that .
te	4	Gizmo hadn 't been happy at that news , but all things considered , he was feeling remarkably well especially after such an intrusive surgery .
te	4	§ § § The following morning Dr. Strom released Gizmo from the medical clinic but again reminded him against any strenuous activity for the next seven days .
te	2	Gizmo only hoped things would improve over time , but had his doubts they would ever be on good terms with the Director of Security .
te	3	They were told their transportation platforms would not allow them to go beyond a certain point into a restricted area without the proper authorization code .
te	4	Anyone sitting in either of the vehicles could be tracked or ' seen ' as an object on radar able to pick up brain wave activity .
te	2	As soon as we get back , I am going to pull the plug on you and do a major reprogramming of your attitude . "
te	4	Turning to Marco , he said , " I hate it when she uses logic on me to beat me at my own arguments . "
te	1	Is there another universe out there that ours will combine with , or will it again trigger a big explosion if our universe collides with it ?
te	3	" I 'd have to check with him first and get back to you but I don 't think he 'll holler too much . "
te	1	I don 't want any tracking devices or anything else attached to you , and I don 't want anyone close enough to examine you .
te	2	§ § § As they stood on the hanger deck looking around wondering which way to go , they saw their hosts approaching from a far corner .
te	0	" Giselle , " Gizmo said , " eject the toy spacecraft on a fast trajectory away from us as fast as possible and engage cloaking .
te	4	As is usually the case , life got in the way and he ended up getting a degree in a field totally unrelated to writing or photography .
te	4	This short novel follows the adventures of Gizmo and his friends through the many and varied universes , in the many varied times of their evolution .
te	4	The soldiers surrounding them were shooting at the creatures in the dark , fell like a doll so they starting to run for their lives .
te	4	The land was nowhere to be seen , the grey clouds were moving slowly from the sky , the ship jumped up and down against the waves .
te	3	With a full swing , Michel threw something afar and he did it two more times ; swiftly , he ducked to the bottom of the boat .
te	1	" Waterproof sleeping bag , Woolen socks , Mosquito nets , Stoves , " said Jessica , smiling at the various stuff spread on the deck .
te	1	" Gentlemen , we will continue this later , I have to talk to him in private , " said Ricky , dismissing the crowd .
te	4	" There is no reason for her to leave like that , I mean ... She needed the shelter , she couldn 't have just left . "
te	1	Poe had an old dog named Donald , Jake was interested in the old hound sticking its tongue out and running inside the woods cheerfully .
te	4	" I mean look , she 's so fucking cunt , Oh Evan , I 'm bored , let 's make her know who we are ! "
te	0	Alvin took out the picture while on a break and looked at the photo of Diana , him , Tasha and Jake , laughing inside the picture .
te	4	Paul and Michel , who were surrounded by them , spat out the rat 's back bone , competing against each other for who spat further .
te	4	" There were ten bomb threats and five death threats in the agency this month , " " Quite an improvement , " said Heston .
te	3	" Although I 'm more worried about the revolt from Veron 's officers ... " Ricky went to the kitchen and put out the jar of tea .
te	4	" There was a big fire in the hill from the eastside , " said one soldier to Logan , handing him the burnt device .
te	0	At the night of the overthrow , which was hardly a coup , Logan threw Morris 's head in front of Veron and laughed at him .
te	3	" Even if they 've got all the data of the enemy , it doesn 't matter if they don 't know which part to use it .
te	1	" Those refugees in the island are those who try to hide from the Assassins ' Chamber ... " murmured Heston , pouring whiskey to his glass .
te	1	" Bunch of militants is ravishing the island now , " said Gilbert to Poe , hearing the sound of wailing and lamenting from the ladies .
te	1	Convince him to find Ricky Guido , and give him the drive ; we ' ll give you the detail soon , " said he .
te	1	" Your organization is dying off , good luck trying to stay alive , " muttered Ned , licking the last drops of his whiskey .
te	4	" I 'm not sure ... I don 't see any base from here , so they have been waiting for somebody for sure . "
te	3	" I guess it is true what they talk about you , " said Tasha , looking at her beauty , reflected under the moon .
te	0	" Go away , Captain , I 've got a gun , and you don 't , " said Sarah , shooing him off with her pistol .
te	0	" Oh ... Sarah , I don 't think you can resist my charm , " said James , winking , making a weird cute face .
te	1	" Admiral , pardon me , but I don 't think it is wise to move right now ... " murmured James , interrupting her .
te	3	hissed the assassin , looking at the turmoil right in front of her " Just a little more , fall down to the pit . "
te	3	" This looks not bad actually ... " said Alvin , taking a bite ; the men there wanted to find out whether it is poisonous .
te	4	After the days and days of turmoil and life-threatening situation , she finally became free from the oppression and from the pursuers who wanted to kill her .
te	4	We have a reason to believe that you are engaged in treason , by conspiring with Ricky Guido to conquer Cassandra , " sneered Heston .
te	3	" Don 't look at me like that ... We are all at the table , with the dice and chips , " muttered Heston .
te	1	He said it reminds him of his wife ... " " I know it is quite random question to ask but , " said Molly .
te	3	" I have to go to the general 's meeting in twenty minutes , so let 's get this over with fast , " said Walter .
te	2	" According to our president , in this hour of peril , he does not wish to deploy troops to so-called ' Island of Riddles . '
te	3	Captain Baldi , after wiping out the petty rulers in the island , destroyed many plantations by pouring the sea water on it , ruining the soil .
te	2	This place smelled familiar .
te	0	That man had been happy .
te	2	I understood the shouting now , too .
te	4	Except me , apparently .
te	2	My voice sounded dull and flat .
te	1	" Yes , sir . "
te	1	" Yes , sir . "
te	1	" Yes , sir . "
te	1	My mind was numb .
te	2	" How are you ? "
te	0	He glanced at my arm .
te	3	" Does it hurt ? "
te	1	I asked him in return .
te	1	" Is it always like this ? "
te	0	It was always this hard .
te	1	She missed the worst of it ? "
te	1	" Like ... this .
te	0	A stupid game of capture the flag .
te	2	" Ready to go home ? "
te	2	It wasn 't particularly helpful .
te	0	Acacia wasn 't here .
te	2	" Oh , come on .
te	0	That laughter sounded again .
te	1	Basically , I 'm a psychic imprint .
te	0	He shook his head .
te	2	" Didn 't you ?
te	2	" He did ? "
te	1	I told him everything .
te	3	My heart jumped into my throat .
te	1	Such as - ? "
te	2	" Go back home .
te	0	" What about Acacia ? "
te	2	There was no blood .
te	1	Do a hard restart or something !
te	0	" Acacia Jones . "
te	1	I paused , considering that .
te	0	That made a certain amount of sense .
te	0	I was here , though .
te	1	It 's not possible .
te	2	Finally , finally it stopped .
te	2	I managed , and she nodded .
te	4	" We 're not anywhere ?
te	3	Without a destination . "
te	0	She shook her head .
te	4	" We fell through time . "
te	1	" I think so .
te	2	She smiled , but didn 't respond .
te	1	" On the mountain .
te	2	And one of them looked familiar .
te	1	" He found us ! "
te	0	" He hasn 't .
te	1	" Can he find us ? "
te	0	I sat back down .
te	0	And that he was ... anchored ... ?
te	2	Fixed on our souls . "
te	3	" They do that . " "
te	0	Finally , Acacia shook her head .
te	2	" No , hold on .
te	0	Acacia looked at me .
te	1	He says I , first person .
te	4	" I think this happened recently .
te	1	We can fix him . "
te	3	It 's much more complicated than that .
te	2	I couldn 't move .
te	4	And there were bars .
te	0	" Why do you say that ? "
te	2	" Oh , come on .
te	1	" She said so . "
te	0	He had to mean all of us .
te	0	" Where 's Acacia ? "
te	2	Do not bother . "
te	4	Where are we going ? "
te	1	I wasn 't sure .
te	2	" Are you on the council ? "
te	2	" So who are you ? "
te	3	Watch your step . "
te	2	" Good luck , Joseph Harker . "
te	3	This wasn 't right .
te	3	I started to run .
te	0	For how Acacia had betrayed me .
te	0	The thought gave me chills .
te	1	" Are you hurt , Hue ? "
te	4	" Where are you going ? "
te	3	That was only mostly true .
te	2	" You have to go ! "
te	4	" Get out of here ! "
te	3	It felt like taking my first steps .
te	2	I should have known it all along .
te	1	" I 'm sorry . "
te	2	We both looked to the window .
te	0	" What are you talking about ? "
te	2	" Both of you .
te	2	You 're both wrong .
te	1	No pupils , nothing .
te	1	" Yes , Professor . "
te	1	This was the Professor .
te	2	" Not yet , Professor .
te	0	" And HEX 's magic . "
te	0	Acacia 's voice was barely a whisper .
te	1	He 's strong . "
te	4	I hope I feel love , someday .
te	1	Joaquim smirked at me .
te	4	We 're re-creating . "
te	2	So much chaos ... " " Joaquim .
te	1	" Your father and mother ?
te	2	Would yours do the same ? "
te	4	" They 're ready . "
te	0	Joaquim was not nearly as excited now .
te	1	" Professor , what is this ? "
te	0	" Help him ! "
te	2	And more important , why would I ?
te	1	Use us , they said .
te	0	Let us Walk again .
te	1	It was so easy .
te	4	We had to be .
te	3	" What was that thing ? " "
te	2	" You looked like you knew . "
te	0	She shook her head .
te	0	I asked , afraid of the answer .
te	2	Did they ... ? "
te	4	She was silent for another moment .
te	4	" You were there , too .
te	3	" Find the traitor . "
te	1	I 'd punch it .
te	0	As a friend . "
te	2	" No cells ? "
te	2	She smiled , brilliantly .
te	1	No holding fields , no Sentry . "
te	3	" He 's not that scary . "
te	1	Our Silver Dream . "
te	3	So did that stone statue .
te	3	That was true for me , too .
te	2	I could find more of us .
te	1	He was so limp .
te	0	And I was empty .
te	4	From everywhere the women came running .
te	0	He turned his back on the light .
te	4	He climbed to his feet .
te	3	" What 's that shouting outside ? "
te	1	James was his eldest son .
te	0	James said it again .
te	1	My mother was trembling .
te	2	You saw it too .
te	1	Salome was like my sister .
te	2	Little Symeon was giggling .
te	3	My mother started to cry .
te	2	" Wake up now . "
te	1	I was in Joseph 's arms .
te	4	These were Joseph 's brothers .
te	4	said the Teacher to the whole crowd .
te	3	What 's the matter with you ! "
te	0	" You sound like a madman ! "
te	2	Listen to your own words ! "
te	2	More of them came into the room .
te	0	She was too afraid .
te	1	No one said anything .
te	4	Not even the Teacher spoke .
te	2	" Leaving to go home ? "
te	2	" You mock our forefathers ? "
te	0	" Then why go ?
te	0	You leave Alexandria for that . "
te	3	But my mother was still crying .
te	1	" Stop , " Joseph said .
te	2	No one said a word .
te	0	The Teacher was taken aback .
te	2	" How do you know ? "
te	4	The Teacher did not answer my mother .
te	0	" What is Nazareth ?
te	1	Your terrible stories , why you - .
te	2	Philo would see to it - . "
te	1	No more the library of parchment scrolls .
te	2	All this Rome rules .
te	2	I shook off the memory .
te	0	James was staring at me .
te	1	You liked his library . "
te	1	" Jesus , speak up ! "
te	1	But Joseph stopped him .
te	2	He took money out of his purse .
te	0	I have many a time . "
te	0	He was kind as always with her .
te	3	Do you think they 've forgotten anything ?
te	1	Besides ... " " What star ?
te	2	I couldn 't hold back anymore .
te	2	Joseph was looking at me .
te	1	" Yes , " said Joseph .
te	2	How could it not be ?
te	3	I didn 't want to sleep .
te	3	But now my thoughts were racing .
te	0	And what had happened today ?
te	1	I felt a hand on mine .
te	1	" I know , " I said .
te	3	I stroked the head of Little Justus .
te	4	My eyes snapped open .
te	4	Where had that power come from ?
te	3	Was it still there ?
te	2	No one would talk of these things .
te	3	Better to trust as they trusted .
te	0	I laughed with her .
te	4	The land grew ever more distant .
te	1	Nothing he says means anything anyway . "
te	0	I wondered what they thought of him .
te	3	And they just might get it . "
te	1	I did it suddenly , surprising myself .
te	2	Don 't you know it ?
te	1	Joseph was at my side .
te	2	Both these boys should know . "
te	4	" But what happened in Bethlehem ? "
te	3	I was getting a little cold .
te	3	Little Salome was waiting to question me .
te	2	Salome wanted to know .
te	3	" I want to see it . "
te	1	" Is it a big town ? "
te	0	" A village , " she said .
te	0	" That an angel came to Nazareth ?
te	0	And again came his low private laughing .
te	0	This was her way with her husband .
te	1	I was very sorry to see this .
te	4	But he never answered him .
te	0	It was as if nothing had happened .
te	2	I knew not to say another word .
te	4	We were going to Jerusalem .
te	0	" Why do you say that ? "
te	1	I shrugged my shoulders .
te	3	" You know that it 's true .
te	1	The Lord is always with us . "
te	2	She laughed and so did I .
te	2	Tomorrow we would go to it .
te	4	But James would be with the men .
te	0	He wasn 't right in the head .
te	4	he said to me .
te	0	My aunt came nearer again .
te	0	The bread was warm too .
te	3	But it was still very good .
te	0	At last we began dipping our bread .
te	1	my mother asked him .
te	2	" Why should we go away ? "
te	3	But what did this mean ?
te	4	I could feel the fever in him .
te	4	Remember , I told you .
te	4	He looked at her .
te	1	My mind was working and working .
te	2	I felt chilled all over .
te	1	" So it was with King David .
te	0	Did you hear all that ?
te	0	Make this pain go away .
te	3	I wanted to cry .
te	2	I was a little colder .
te	1	I was not Joseph 's son .
te	4	She was crouching over me .
te	1	My mother came back .
te	1	I answered in Greek without thinking .
te	3	" My brother has seen to that .
te	4	Would that he could suffer in silence .
te	4	She turned towards me .
te	0	She shook her head .
te	1	She was soft and almost sad .
te	2	" People will say things ... ? "
te	0	She put her hand over her mouth .
te	0	I thought she might cry .
te	1	" The Lord can do anything . "
te	0	My head was pounding with thoughts .
te	1	More a little sign than a giving .
te	3	But the crowd didn 't like them .
te	4	I think the children were thrilled .
te	2	The blood just gushed out of him .
te	2	" Little Salome ! "
te	2	Take those words to Herod .
te	2	The crowd was loose and broken .
te	3	The soldiers didn 't hurt them .
te	2	They came on foot into the crowd .
te	0	I raised my arms and prayed .
te	3	Chapter 6 The quiet was not quiet .
te	0	And our dead man was all alone .
te	2	I had hold of Little Salome .
te	4	All the people moved to the gateway .
te	2	How would this blood be cleaned away ?
te	0	I was not afraid yet .
te	4	I was wide eyed .
te	2	You go to your homes . "
te	1	asked my cousin Silas .
te	1	This was a good sign .
te	3	But it didn 't matter now .
te	2	Did anyone come to bury him ?
te	2	What happened if nobody did ?
te	0	He laughed his soft slow laugh .
te	2	" Did you ? "
te	0	He shook his head .
te	3	That 's the truth of it .
te	2	He began coughing again .
te	1	You 're with us .
te	0	James was looking at me .
te	3	I started to cry .
te	4	" The King of the Jews . "
te	0	Chapter 7 A dream .
te	0	Something wet was against my face .
te	2	Little Salome was calling to me .
te	0	What was this place , a cave ?
te	3	" Put out the lamps ! "
te	1	James said : " Jericho is burning .
te	4	The palace of Herod is in flames .
te	1	His voice was steady .
te	2	Don 't you worry at all . "
te	0	" And why shouldn 't they ? "
te	1	" Where is your brother ? "
te	0	" Oh , but why ? "
te	4	She stood behind me .
te	1	I went into wild crying .
te	3	I couldn 't get away from it .
te	2	Let your mother hold you .
te	2	Who was looking for me ?
te	3	I didn 't want to sleep .
te	1	Strangers were in the front room .
te	1	They had rags around their wrists .
te	4	" What do we have here ?
te	2	Half the village . "
te	4	" Come on , everything ! "
te	1	The women did nothing .
te	0	said the man , stepping back .
te	1	" I can 't understand you .
te	2	What do you want us to do ?
te	4	We are people of peace .
te	1	I can 't understand you . "
te	1	" You miserable ignorant filth . "
te	4	We knew what had happened .
te	2	All of us knew .
te	2	Little Salome was sniffling .
te	4	He looked like he was already dead .
te	2	" Don 't look at him . "
te	3	It doesn 't matter . "
te	1	said Elizabeth in a low voice .
te	2	My cousin John was looking at me .
te	0	His face didn 't show much .
te	4	Elizabeth lowered her voice and spoke on .
te	4	He will learn the prophets .
te	0	The mothers said hush to the babies .
te	3	" Out with it . "
te	1	I had not known it .
te	0	Again she looked at each and all .
te	0	" Many saw what happened .
te	3	I have nothing for them to take .
te	2	Now you , you go . "
te	3	" They tried to steal them ! "
te	3	Little John stood there staring at me .
te	4	" But who are the Essenes ? "
te	2	How could I know ? "
te	2	" How can we know ?
te	3	I hardly thought about it .
te	3	Isn 't that so ? "
te	4	He looked away as he spoke .
te	3	But now is not that time . "
te	1	I didn 't think so .
te	1	" The River Jordan ! "
te	2	But did David do it ?
te	4	And to the river we finally came .
te	1	We were singing and shouting .
te	0	He threw up his hands .
te	4	He didn 't sing for the people .
te	2	" What did I do ? "
te	1	" No , " she said .
te	2	She didn 't understand .
te	1	Little Joseph was snoring .
te	2	" Look to him ! "
te	2	Talk of common things .
te	3	This is not the most difficult part .
te	0	I was happy and sad .
te	3	Thoughts began to slide .
te	1	I 'll find out everything .
te	2	No , you don 't know .
te	2	And how do I know that ?
te	2	We woke up to shouts and crying .
te	3	People didn 't talk about it now .
te	0	Archelaus had sailed to Rome .
te	0	And many others said the same thing .
te	1	The talk went on and on .
te	4	It made me feel safe .
te	1	In this beautiful land ?
te	3	" It won 't be burnt up .
te	2	You go back to sleep . "
te	4	Joseph looked at him the whole time .
te	4	" We have been through it . "
te	3	I looked up at the stars .
te	4	The fire had gone out .
te	0	" How can you say that ? "
te	2	And they almost did .
te	0	I was afraid of the flames .
te	3	The distant fire showed nothing yet .
te	3	I started to run after them .
te	3	They broke what little I had .
te	1	She went on and on .
te	1	I couldn 't see anything .
te	2	I felt my skin all over .
te	4	I could barely see him .
te	2	" Go back to your bed . "
te	4	And somehow I went to sleep .
te	3	We 'd written to them .
te	1	The men said nothing .
te	0	" Who would bother with Nazareth ? "
te	1	" I know it . "
te	3	It was a beautiful thing to behold .
te	4	The men were not themselves .
te	4	But they had been quiet all day .
te	1	" Is it burning too ? "
te	4	Beyond was the great fire .
te	4	" Perhaps we should remain here .
te	2	" What , from you ? "
te	4	" We have tunnels ? "
te	2	And we 'll go .
te	3	" Don 't talk .
te	1	" May I go with him ? "
te	0	We had had mud floors in Alexandria .
te	2	I had to know .
te	3	We went into the courtyard .
te	2	You have this whole town for yourselves .
te	2	No one said a word .
te	2	Still no one spoke .
te	3	At once Little Salome started crying .
te	0	We always have . "
te	0	I couldn 't cry .
te	4	" Take me . "
te	1	I will die for the family . "
te	1	" I will go with you .
te	1	I 'm never good at anything .
te	2	I 'll be good for something now .
te	4	I will be the one . "
te	1	And you are young men .
te	2	I 'll show it to you .
te	3	You don 't want it like this .
te	2	Look at this village .
te	1	Why this stupid rebellion ?
te	3	But the first soldier went on .
te	3	" Battle 's one thing .
te	0	And they rode away .
te	4	Her eyes were under hoods of wrinkles .
te	0	The air was fresh and almost warm .
te	0	There was talk all around me .
te	1	I didn 't mind it .
te	1	I couldn 't see anything .
te	1	I wished it was daylight .
te	0	I began to cry again .
te	0	The air was sweet and almost warm .
te	0	But again it was hard to see .
te	0	" What are you dreaming ? "
te	1	And I wanted to sing .
te	4	Leave it alone . "
te	2	You will be eight years old soon .
te	4	But here was the green grass .
te	2	I looked off towards the village .
te	1	I felt my skin .
te	1	And it was so sweet .
te	1	Theirs was the world of the grass .
te	3	That 's all they knew .
te	1	I felt no sadness .
te	4	The earth was a bed under me .
te	0	But a man was coming .
te	0	Perhaps all of us were that way .
te	1	I couldn 't answer .
te	4	There will come a time .
te	2	I didn 't say a word .
te	0	" Are you sad ? "
te	1	" No , " I said quickly .
te	1	" I like it ! "
te	0	Finally , the Sabbath was upon us .
te	2	But what did Jonah do ?
te	1	He tried to run from the Lord .
te	1	Can anyone run from the Lord ?
te	2	O Lord my God . "
te	1	said Joseph , raising his eyebrows .
te	2	We all nodded . "
te	0	He threw up his hands . "
te	2	Joseph slapped his legs and nodded .
te	1	But I liked it .
te	2	I stood on the wood threshold .
te	1	And no one was blocking my way .
te	1	I didn 't like it .
te	1	Let him in . "
te	2	And so I did .
te	4	We were never alone .
te	4	" You 're the Egyptians . "
te	2	People just go on .
te	0	The whole family laughed at him .
te	0	I always have . "
te	4	" Were you almost a scribe ? "
te	4	We walked on in silence .
te	3	The earth was thick with rotted leaves .
te	4	When we laughed , Joseph corrected us .
te	0	" What did happen to him ? "
te	2	The money was good .
te	0	Maybe it was the way .
te	2	And at once I looked down .
te	3	I wanted to cry .
te	2	I looked at the old man .
te	2	The old man looked at Joseph .
te	1	The old man said nothing .
te	2	No one said a word .
te	1	Surely you understand . "
te	3	Joseph didn 't want to say it .
te	2	" I had to go .
te	1	" Hmmm ... " said the Rabbi .
te	3	I didn 't know what it meant .
te	2	I did as he told me .
te	1	" It was the Philistines .
te	1	I didn 't answer for a moment .
te	1	The Old Rabbi drew back in surprise .
te	2	The Rabbi drew back .
te	0	What had I said ?
te	1	" I like this child . "
te	3	I sat down there on the mat .
te	1	In it were delicious curds with honey .
te	2	My mother looked at the bowl .
te	0	That made them all laugh .
te	0	Men and women came to Old Sarah .
te	0	A house was a private place .
te	3	But it was not to be .
te	3	They watched us at our work .
te	1	I didn 't mind all those times .
te	3	But studying in Nazareth was better .
te	2	" It could be from the Romans .
te	1	And she wouldn 't answer him .
te	3	But not to sleep .
te	0	He had a soft musical voice .
te	4	He smiled at me .
te	0	All was beauty around me .
te	0	" Why should I ? "
te	2	" Who are you ! "
te	0	All dreams came to an end .
te	0	But he was no child .
te	2	I could not do anything for him .
te	2	" Who are you ! "
te	1	I didn 't answer him .
te	3	I didn 't want to see it .
te	1	But this was far worse .
te	0	I was so afraid .
te	4	this strange creature asked me .
te	2	I wouldn 't look .
te	2	I tell you , chaos rules .
te	1	And I am its Prince . "
te	4	You 're safe . "
te	3	I found that out afterwards .
te	2	I turned to look .
te	3	I went out into the courtyard .
te	1	I 'm not a girl .
te	2	I 'll care for all of them .
te	1	" I mean it .
te	2	We were pulling our blows some , but it still hurt .
te	0	" Yeah , and I was back within a week .
te	0	Jerzy danced back at that , glancing up toward the mountain .
te	2	Jumping was our only option - The cave .
te	0	" Cracked collarbone and dislocated jaw , sprained wrist . "
te	2	It didn 't sound like my dad anymore .
te	0	The air was sharp and tangy but somehow still .
te	1	It smelled like medicine ... I was in the infirmary .
te	1	" Proximal humerus fracture , bruised ribs , dust inhalation .
te	3	The cave protected him from the worst of it . "
te	4	He 'd survive , they were pretty sure .
te	0	I wasn 't sure she 'd appreciate it , anyway .
te	3	It meant things had just gotten worse for us .
te	3	It meant we all had to band together .
te	4	Regular sessions with the therapist have been scheduled . "
te	3	I wasn 't hungry , but I tried to eat anyway .
te	3	I didn 't know how to answer that .
te	1	" I saw Jo flying right as I fell .
te	0	Have you heard anything else about Jaya ? "
te	2	He 'd activated his shield disk and jumped .
te	4	If we don 't , Binary and HEX will take over .
te	1	He hesitated , still playing with his fork .
te	3	How could I not have thought about that ?
te	1	Why did things have to keep going wrong like this ?
te	3	I wasn 't tired , but I wanted to be .
te	0	I wanted to sleep until everything was back to normal again .
te	1	Dirt that 'd had a hand in killing him .
te	3	Dust still hung thick in the air near the mountain .
te	2	I wished I had someone to talk to .
te	3	Mother Nature was not something you wanted to mess with .
te	3	In retrospect , perhaps this wasn 't that great a tribute .
te	2	" Do you want me to go there ? "
te	0	He flickered an affirmation , giving a pleased up-and-down bob .
te	0	I still wasn 't sure it was a fair trade-off .
te	4	The voice seemed to be coming from Hue .
te	1	I spun around , saw nothing , darted behind Hue .
te	1	Hue , help him out , would you ? "
te	2	" No , I 'm sort of half here .
te	3	" If you want to call it that .
te	2	" How 're things going at school ? "
te	1	Jay 's eyebrows shot up almost to his hairline .
te	0	" So ... Acacia 's a - " " Time Agent .
te	3	I 'm trying to talk to you like an adult .
te	2	" So what do I do now ? "
te	3	Suddenly I couldn 't wait to get out of there .
te	0	What actually happened was that I got shot by a laser .
te	0	When he did , though , I could see past him .
te	1	I was going to have to find a new shield .
te	3	I didn 't really want to hurt him .
te	0	A blast of heat ruffled my hair as I jumped again .
te	2	The only place I could go was down .
te	3	" Since the last time I had to jet .
te	2	How long ago was that for you ? "
te	1	" I 'm guessing you know , then . "
te	1	I was rewarded with a bright , mischievous grin .
te	1	Your ship , ah , punching it was a little disorienting .
te	4	Have you ever been really , really seasick ? "
te	2	" Well , it was probably kind of like that . "
te	1	" I remember learning about this in high school . "
te	4	I had to keep him on the defensive .
te	0	I had to get him away from Acacia .
te	3	Did she really think that was going to work ?
te	0	Acacia straightened up abruptly , putting a hand on my shoulder .
te	3	" It 's pretty good , huh ? "
te	4	" You could ask where we aren 't . "
te	3	She took a deep breath , shifting to sit up .
te	3	Acacia took it from me , turning it over thoughtfully .
te	4	I counted the seconds until she was done .
te	0	Acacia 's fingernails were more powerful than anything we had .
te	3	" That can 't be right , " I muttered .
te	3	" Yeah , but ... this is the one I lost .
te	1	I powered it down , clipping it back to my belt .
te	4	If he could , he 'd be here .
te	3	But that 's not how we do it .
te	3	" The things we 're sworn to fight .
te	2	" How do you know about them ? "
te	0	He was out for a few days . "
te	4	My friend was a member of the Binary now .
te	2	this doesn 't solve how he followed us , though .
te	3	That 's how we stay on top . "
te	2	" Because it 's my job to know .
te	0	" Nowhere 's safe right now , Acacia .
te	1	She had me in some kind of antigravity grip .
te	3	It wasn 't just in that one room , either .
te	0	Why do you think she 's trying to help me ? "
te	3	Best to gather information about where I was first .
te	2	" You said I was to come with you .
te	0	The landing wasn 't as easy as before .
te	4	Did I have to Walk somewhere else first ?
te	2	I 'd assumed it would be overcast , dark .
te	3	The metal at the grip was rusted almost through .
te	3	For the fact that I 'd been too late .
te	4	It was ransacked : his desk overturned , papers scattered everywhere .
te	2	Get to the port room if you can .
te	3	I left the room the way it was .
te	3	Probably not , now that I thought of it .
te	3	Not only was it instinct , it was protocol .
te	3	I didn 't know how to feel about that .
te	1	Time is a dimension , too , in that sense .
te	0	I have to find Acacia so she can tell me . "
te	1	His form shifted , becoming less spherical and more ... liquid .
te	2	Seems to be a lot of that going around . "
te	1	" I didn 't like you from the beginning . "
te	1	He smiled , looking both apologetic and horribly , infuriatingly smug .
te	2	" I am one of you , Joey . "
te	1	I mentioned I had a wooden chair , right ?
te	1	I activated my shield disk , sprinting toward him .
te	3	I wasn 't paying attention to Joaquim anymore , either .
te	4	I doubted there was enough of them left to know .
te	4	I wasn 't sure that was possible ... " Everywhere . "
te	4	" Here and there , all of space and time .
te	2	I could still tell he was looking at me .
te	1	" Have you finished draining him yet ? "
te	4	" They gave me the power to fix everything . "
te	0	Acacia had broken whatever link Joaquim had made with me .
te	2	I could turn my head but not move my body .
te	0	Slowly , yes ... But you , Joey .
te	2	The hair on the back of my neck stood up .
te	0	Jay was safe , and so was Jerzy .
te	2	" I have some of your memories , too , Joey .
te	0	Armageddon , if you want to be dramatic .
te	1	Why don 't villains ever want something rational ? "
te	1	Isn 't it fine the way it is ? "
te	1	" Poetic philosophy , " he snapped back .
te	2	Do you know how many of us were hurt ?
te	3	I didn 't stop to watch any further .
te	0	Acacia was beside me now , one hand clutching my wrist .
te	0	He was holding his hand out to the lights .
te	1	I took a breath , finding the gate in my mind .
te	1	" I 'm sorry , Joe , I really am . "
te	1	" We 're going to report first . "
te	2	Hundreds more , if you count all those souls .
te	2	" So you 're asking for my help . "
te	2	" No , I was trying to save you .
te	4	" It 's because he was stealing them , right ?
te	3	" I 'd try to break the link .
te	1	" They 're not coming , " I said .
te	4	We were afraid to even whisper , afraid to breathe .
te	4	He smiled , the expression not at all pleasant .
te	4	His red eyes were wide , ears perked up with excitement .
te	1	Finally , finally , I saw movement behind him .
te	1	It was you who made all this possible . "
te	2	And in doing so , showed me how to defeat you .
te	4	Instead of everything , there was absolutely nothing .
te	2	I groaned , rolling over onto my side .
te	3	To make all worlds into what they wished .
te	1	It would be erased , and I along with it .
te	3	Still breathing deeply , I cast out for a portal .
te	0	" He wouldn 't do such a thing . "
te	0	Salome was my age , and my dearest and closest .
te	2	He was too little to know what was going on .
te	1	I was like a fish in the river .
te	3	They put up their hands against the crowd .
te	2	" There 's blood on your face ! "
te	1	" I 'm not hurt , " I said .
te	3	I meant to say it didn 't matter .
te	0	But there was James with his hard look .
te	0	The Teacher came into the room backwards with his hands up .
te	2	All of us had to move to make room .
te	0	" Are you complaining that he 's alive now !
te	0	" Oh , that you say such things ! "
te	1	" Jesus and James are my finest pupils .
te	4	My mother backed up against the wall , holding me close .
te	3	I wanted to get away , but I couldn 't .
te	2	" Or you mock the Lord Himself ? "
te	2	Do you know one word of Hebrew ? "
te	2	" Do you yourself know what that means ! "
te	1	" I 'd like to hear you explain it .
te	0	What do any of you know , you hardheaded Galilean Jews ?
te	2	No more school for them now , I fear . "
te	1	I knew this was not an easy moment .
te	4	I 've never heard of such a place .
te	2	Philo would educate your son if you would allow .
te	2	No more the rich house with its marble floors .
te	4	There is Rome , here is Alexandria , here is Jerusalem .
te	1	" He stays with us , " said Joseph calmly .
te	2	" He will not go to Philo . "
te	1	" As soon as we can , " said Joseph .
te	4	He pressed it into the hand of the Teacher .
te	1	" It wasn 't much , " I said .
te	4	Aunt Salome and Aunt Esther were there too .
te	0	He knew that this was what he had to do .
te	2	Philo was pleased at that and nodded and smiled .
te	3	We have the Torah , the Prophets , the Tradition .
te	1	And I didn 't say anything about it now .
te	3	" Do you think anybody there has forgotten that ?
te	1	" Please don 't say those words . "
te	3	" You mustn 't worry about it , " she said .
te	1	" You have more cousins than you can count in Nazareth .
te	1	Old Sarah 's waiting for us , and Old Justus .
te	2	She stood up and beckoned for me to come .
te	2	My uncle would not stop his soft laughing .
te	1	" This is true , " said Joseph .
te	0	" Nazareth is a small place , " he said .
te	0	I saw the clay sparrows that I had made .
te	2	Joseph hadn 't spoken one word to me about it .
te	1	And I couldn 't ask anyone , now , could I ?
te	2	I felt still and I felt very small .
te	0	It came as if an angel had touched me .
te	3	I stopped trying to stay awake and think on these things .
te	3	But what was that to passing before it now ?
te	4	" Well , what does he tell the people ? "
te	3	The crowds don 't want patience right now .
te	2	You are old enough to know that , child .
te	2	And Herod took their lives for this ! "
te	0	He would know the names of Matthias and Judas .
te	3	" It was the right and just thing to do .
te	2	" Will we still go to Jerusalem ? "
te	0	The wind was blowing hard now and the boat was heaving .
te	4	It was warm here and I felt better .
te	3	They were pointing to the sail and to the rig .
te	1	" I hope we go , " I said .
te	0	I thought of all the words I 'd heard .
te	1	" Yes , I know , " she said .
te	1	" Yes , " I said with a big sigh .
te	1	To say small things , and nothing more .
te	3	I knew that he just might tell us something .
te	1	" My mother says she knows this . "
te	2	" What would you do , Father ? "
te	3	He had said that the Teacher ought to see that .
te	0	And laughing , always laughing under his breath .
te	0	I still heard Greek spoken around us as much as Aramaic .
te	4	We children jumped up and down with excitement .
te	1	For a long time , I couldn 't see anything .
te	1	My mother fell into this woman 's arms .
te	2	The roof couldn 't hold any more people .
te	4	I would be with the children and the women .
te	3	Little Salome went quiet also , just looking at her father .
te	4	The first prayer we all said together in Jerusalem .
te	3	I didn 't think about anything except the food .
te	3	I ate until I almost couldn 't eat anymore .
te	2	" You go away , " he told her .
te	0	" And what do you mean by that ? "
te	4	" I believed her , " he said .
te	1	" I am her brother , am I not ?
te	0	She turned away , and then moved away .
te	0	I didn 't know whether she heard him or not .
te	0	How could he touch her after such a thing ? "
te	1	Until such time as Saul sent for him .
te	3	Until such time as the Lord God sent for him !
te	3	Don 't you see , that 's what confounds them all !
te	3	That you must grow up like any other child !
te	4	" I am still amused , " he answered .
te	3	Ah , listen to them down in the streets .
te	0	I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heart .
te	0	I sat down and leaned against the low wall .
te	0	An angel had come to my mother , an angel .
te	4	They stood over me , their robes brushing my face .
te	0	What could I say to my aunt Mary ?
te	0	Down below a man played the pipe and another man sang .
te	3	" But it can 't wait now , " she said .
te	2	Do as Joseph told you in that regard .
te	1	" You can 't understand this ... can you ? "
te	1	" Anything is possible with the Lord , " I said .
te	2	" The Lord made Adam from the dust .
te	4	When she spoke again , she didn 't sound like herself .
te	3	I didn 't want her to be hurt .
te	1	I know , " I said to her .
te	1	Now this was not the sprinkling and cleansing for Passover .
te	4	And some were praying with their eyes half closed .
te	4	And others were merely talking to each other .
te	0	I could hardly bear the slow pace of waiting .
te	0	" Yeshua , " she called in the Aramaic .
te	4	We were on our knees and pitched forward .
te	4	I held Salome and threw up my left hand .
te	4	Little Salome cried : " Oh Lord , deliver me ! "
te	2	All around us people called on the Lord .
te	4	Some groups of people were like mounds of the dead .
te	2	" Joseph , look , " cried my mother .
te	0	Was I to turn away from his very death ?
te	2	Blood poured out of the man 's mouth .
te	2	Blood came out of his mouth onto the stones .
te	4	Beyond them more stayed on their knees and prayed .
te	2	The body of the soldier was covered with blood .
te	2	" Leave , go to your homes ! "
te	0	Aunt Salome and Aunt Esther had my mother by her arms .
te	0	She started to sink again and she groaned .
te	2	And who would come for our dead man ?
te	3	But there wasn 't much time to look .
te	1	" As if they can say there is no Passover !
te	1	My uncle Simon , the quiet one , said nothing .
te	0	Joseph spoke up as he had in Alexandria .
te	4	At the synagogue , we found everyone very afraid .
te	4	We had all seen it , hadn 't we ?
te	3	I saw that windows and doors were shut tight .
te	4	People stepped over the beggars and those huddled here and there .
te	3	The tents of the pilgrims were torn apart .
te	4	We were to move on , everyone was to move on .
te	4	There is no war where we 're going . "
te	0	I started to see in my mind our dead man again .
te	2	And so was my cousin John , the son of Elizabeth .
te	0	The man went down , the spear through his chest .
te	0	He went down again , the spear through his chest .
te	4	Wake up , they said , more voices .
te	3	Caesar Augustus will see to it that it 's rebuilt . "
te	2	" Don 't you worry , little one .
te	4	" We 're safe , little one , " said Joseph .
te	4	Never had I seen a sky like that .
te	0	He was afraid , and it made me more afraid .
te	4	He walked fast with me back into the house .
te	2	Who is to say what are the purposes of the Lord ?
te	2	You are in the hands of God . "
te	1	" We are passing through this , " she said .
te	0	And Elizabeth had just said that an angel came to Joseph .
te	0	Joseph hadn 't said an angel came to him .
te	4	And tomorrow we would leave this terrible place .
te	2	No one spoke a word , and no one moved .
te	0	I held her so tight I must have hurt her .
te	1	I felt my mother 's hands on my shoulders .
te	4	Never lift your hand to defend yourself or to strike .
te	4	They were in a fury against the robbers .
te	0	" And what will they do with him ? "
te	1	" I 'll make my words quick , " Elizabeth said .
te	3	She was patient but wanted to be understood .
te	2	He didn 't look like a little boy .
te	2	" Save your passion for your own sons !
te	2	You speak to Sarah of old , to Hannah of old .
te	2	You speak to one chosen for a reason .
te	0	My aunt Mary was worried and so was my mother .
te	4	I tell you , the boy goes to the Essenes . "
te	3	" Why can 't you come with us to Nazareth ? "
te	2	" And you know I want you to come to Nazareth .
te	3	Then he started coughing again , trying to hide it .
te	1	" Eli the priest , " said Silas quickly .
te	2	" Do you forget everything you know ? "
te	3	I didn 't know what had sent us into Egypt !
te	0	He had already hidden me away with the baby .
te	4	And he wouldn 't tell these soldiers where we were .
te	3	Do you think the chief priests came to protest ? "
te	3	But they didn 't know the reason for it .
te	3	We found our beasts still tethered on the outskirts .
te	3	" But the animals wouldn 't move . "
te	4	She bowed her head and slapped her knees as she laughed .
te	4	When my mother finally came , we set off .
te	1	" I don 't know , " I said .
te	3	They wait until they can purify the Temple .
te	2	" You don 't worry , " he said .
te	1	" But David was King of Israel , " I said .
te	0	" David was King , and Solomon after him .
te	0	And King Josiah , he was a great King of Israel .
te	2	The crowd of those coming out of the mountains was large .
te	2	" Why did King Herod 's men - . "
te	1	I knew they would say this , or words like it .
te	2	Enough talk of the bad things of long ago .
te	2	" I wanted to go into Jericho ! "
te	2	" Couldn 't we go into Jericho for a little while ?
te	1	He sang and sang without looking at anyone .
te	0	People laughing and talking as they do late at night .
te	4	The stars were sprinkled all over the sky .
te	3	What 's the use of trying to tell him anything ?
te	0	And my whole body was like a fist .
te	4	You just had to be able to see them .
te	3	That 's how to do it , I thought .
te	4	And I will find out what happened in Bethlehem .
te	3	Chapter 10 What was the peace of that night ?
te	2	I wanted to go to the Sea of Galilee too .
te	3	I wanted to see it with all my heart .
te	0	You could always smell the water in Alexandria .
te	3	Must we have a tyrant to rule us ? "
te	4	" In every city of the Empire , we 're respected .
te	0	said a stranger , a Jew from Galilee .
te	3	My aunt Mary , the Egyptian , cried out .
te	3	" We came out of Egypt to listen to this ?
te	4	" Everywhere we go it 's changing . "
te	0	I wanted badly for the screams to die away .
te	1	There was a song of screams coming closer and closer .
te	3	I thought it would stop , but it didn 't stop .
te	0	She was breathing hard and couldn 't scream anymore .
te	0	He was a big black shape like the rocks around us .
te	0	" What are they doing with him ? "
te	1	A little bit of light in his eye .
te	4	They made sounds , more than they spoke .
te	2	And Little Salome was crying a little , half asleep .
te	3	I could not make it out , what he said .
te	0	And the Romans could not stop the Arabians from their rampaging .
te	4	I had never seen a tunnel under a house .
te	1	Now he 's stirring up the young men .
te	3	It hurt too much to think of all this .
te	0	And the land around me was so beautiful .
te	0	Old Sarah and Old Justus were waiting in Nazareth .
te	0	Old Sarah was the aunt of my grandmother Anna .
te	4	The land was greener and greener as we moved on .
te	0	And the sun moved high in the sky .
te	2	Most of the people on the road walked on .
te	3	" The men want to rest , " said my mother .
te	1	If it rains we 'll go into the old buildings .
te	1	Men might have died in the getting of it for David .
te	2	" No , but you lost your farm .
te	4	People passed on the road without even seeing us .
te	3	I knew what he meant to do to the woman .
te	2	" Well , what do we do ? "
te	1	" Don 't be so hasty , " said Joseph .
te	4	And there were no sheep grazing , and no cattle .
te	4	Finally we were climbing the slope to Nazareth !
te	1	In Nazareth , we found an empty town .
te	0	I thought about the whole family in this house .
te	3	My aunt stood still as if she 'd turned to stone .
te	2	" What do you have to say for yourselves ? "
te	2	We know nothing of what goes on here .
te	1	I knew if I cried I would sob .
te	3	" It was for this moment that I was spared .
te	2	Only tell me why I should die ? "
te	1	I 'm to offer my life for the family now . "
te	2	You know it , all of you know .
te	0	" Better than nectar and ambrosia , " said the leader .
te	1	You make me think of my grandmother at home .
te	2	It 's no good for anyone when it 's like this .
te	4	Yet they 're putting on crowns and declaring themselves Kings .
te	0	And then Nazareth was as empty and as quiet as before .
te	4	And the new leaves of the fig , so brightly green .
te	1	" This is Old Sarah , " said my mother .
te	4	" Come and let me present you to Old Sarah . "
te	1	" Jesus bar Joseph , " she said .
te	3	But I knew the truth of it , nonetheless .
te	0	The place was a place of shade and of sunlight .
te	3	The men went to tend to the beasts .
te	2	" You think my father had no room there for Homer ?
te	0	" But she has many gray hairs , " I said .
te	1	In the night , I woke up crying .
te	0	I felt my fear would go away if it was daylight .
te	2	Don 't you go up there again . "
te	1	" It was my doing , " I said .
te	1	" I didn 't see the villages , " I said .
te	4	Women passed with their baskets , and I heard children .
te	1	" This is my nephew , Jesus bar Joseph . "
te	3	Toda told him they had to get back to work .
te	2	And James came to look for me quick enough .
te	2	I was eager for us to get to work .
te	2	" I don 't know , " said Joseph .
te	3	I didn 't want to be sleepy , but I was .
te	2	You can be with your mother if you want . "
te	3	That 's what it looked like to me .
te	4	The cries of the birds were a song .
te	2	Never do you talk outside your house to anyone .
te	0	Chapter 15 Old Sarah said we were a whirlwind .
te	3	" That makes it like the stream ? "
te	4	In the light of the lamps , it looked very fine .
te	4	And the rugs here were much better , thicker and softer .
te	0	The Teacher in Alexandria once said Philo was a philosopher .
te	2	We knew it was The Book of Jonah .
te	0	Again we clapped our hands , all of us so happy .
te	2	We loved the way Joseph told the story of Jonah .
te	1	said Joseph , and we all said it with him .
te	3	Fast asleep in the bottom of the ship . "
te	4	We laughed and clapped as he went on .
te	4	We all cried , " The great storm went on . "
te	2	Yet you have brought up my life from corruption .
te	2	Jonah did now as the Lord commanded him .
te	1	' When I was in my own country !
te	4	Perhaps the desert winds weren 't too cold under that vine .
te	3	It is better for me to die than to live ! "
te	3	Has it burned to the ground without my knowing it ? "
te	2	" And I will go as well . "
te	2	Joseph stood up and gestured for us to do the same .
te	4	The men came up around me on either side .
te	1	I was beginning to be scared of it .
te	4	He stared at me and then looked up at the others .
te	3	" Need I say to you that this is the Sabbath ?
te	4	The Rabbi must have been looking at her .
te	0	I looked ahead , and I saw nothing .
te	3	Maybe I saw the light coming through the lattices .
te	0	Maybe I saw all the faces turned towards us .
te	4	And next I knew we were going into the synagogue .
te	1	I didn 't look up when the talking began .
te	1	The Rabbi walked up and down asking questions and inviting answers .
te	0	" I can 't carry you on the Sabbath ! "
te	0	What had they said that night in Alexandria about Bethlehem ?
te	3	I felt things to which I wouldn 't attach words .
te	4	But she had little hope she 'd ever see him again .
te	2	Some went to work and some didn 't .
te	4	" We 've just come from Alexandria , " he said .
te	2	Joseph promised we 'd come back as soon as we could .
te	4	" I 'll remember you , " he said .
te	0	He said , " You ever look at an anthill ? "
te	2	" And what would you know about it , brother ? "
te	1	No answer to my question - no real answer .
te	3	But I couldn 't see to laugh at it .
te	0	And there was Old Sarah waiting for us .
te	3	What is it that we can do for you ? "
te	1	When I saw this , I felt sick .
te	0	This old man had hair and beard that were pure white .
te	4	Not a word came from the men behind me .
te	2	" You know that he 's my son . "
te	3	I started to cry without making a sound .
te	4	Then he looked back to Joseph , above me .
te	4	" Rabbi , these are little children , " said Joseph .
te	0	" And you married an Egyptian woman . "
te	2	And of a good family who has sent you this . "
te	1	I hadn 't known my uncle had such scrolls .
te	0	" And how many gray hairs has Philo of Alexandria ? "
te	0	And they cut his hair to make Samson weak . "
te	3	I didn 't even have to think about it .
te	1	" He will come , " I said .
te	1	" And my lord , " I went on .
te	1	" My lord Rabbi , " I said .
te	2	He pointed to the floor right in front of him .
te	3	I knew only that the worst was over .
te	0	I came back to sit down and eat .
te	2	" Do you know who spoke those words ? "
te	2	I gave it to Joseph who passed it on .
te	2	I hadn 't done my work after school .
te	3	I didn 't want to leave them at all .
te	2	How could anyone ask for more than we had ?
te	1	These things I saw but I was half asleep .
te	0	But at the same time I was walking in a palace .
te	4	On a marble bench , there sat a being with wings .
te	4	How clear was everything under the full moon .
te	0	" Why don 't you live in such a palace ? "
te	1	" I lived in both , " he said .
te	1	And so are his brothers and his sister . "
te	0	He was angry and he was trying to hide it .
te	4	He made me think of my little brothers .
te	2	You don 't know what 's to come ! "
te	3	I didn 't want to look at him .
te	1	" Do you know what 's happening in Jerusalem ? "
te	0	" Is that all you can do ? "
te	2	You think your little miracles will help these foolish people ?
te	3	But no , it wasn 't to happen .
te	2	No , not this way or any other way .
te	0	I could hear a strange voice , a woman 's voice .
te	0	I saw the fields of wheat around Nazareth .
te	2	No , not the world of palaces and ships , no .
te	0	The fear came , a grip on my throat .
te	4	" The children are better , " she said .
te	2	" No , I want to know who ? "
te	4	Joseph was with me and he made me drink some soup .
te	1	" I 'm sorry for it , " I said .
te	1	" I 'm sorry for it , " I said .
te	3	Little Salome wouldn 't stop asking about her mother .
te	3	It wasn 't until the next morning that I got up .
te	3	At first I thought no one was awake in the house .
te	2	" No , not so fast , " said my mother .
te	1	My mother ran her hand over my hair .
te	2	I tried to say something but no words would come out .
te	1	Not now , when there was fighting , no .
te	0	But that was far away , all of that .
te	2	I knew that we did what we could .
te	4	And the house was to receive higher wages .
te	3	The arrows went like that through the air .
te	4	How can we count the number of the dead ? "
te	1	I saw it as I 'd seen it in my dream .
te	4	They brought in those they suspected and executed them .
te	3	They can 't tell the good from the bad among us !
te	0	There was much nodding and approval of that .
te	4	The messenger went on to answer questions from the men .
te	2	I got up and slipped out of the synagogue .
te	1	In the warm air I didn 't shiver anymore .
te	4	And I looked up through the branches of the olive tree .
te	0	" Father in Heaven , I thank you for this . "
te	2	That fool , Simon , is just one of them .
te	2	I 'll tell you one thing about Caesar .
te	1	" But this is Galilee , " he said .
te	2	Do you know what that word means ? "
te	3	What is it you want me to do ? "
te	0	He put his hands up to his head .
te	3	And I can 't bring that trouble to our house .
te	2	How could I not know you were a man ?
te	1	I promise you ... " He went into his thoughts again .
te	2	" But I do understand , " I said .
te	3	" You spoke the truth , " I said .
te	3	" I 'm too little to understand , " I said .
te	4	Chapter 21 The summer had been so good .
te	2	Joseph woke up and took the baby into his arms .
te	0	" Who said it was an Arab child ! "
te	4	It was different after she began weaving in the open courtyard .
te	0	But now as it changed , I was happy .
te	2	Make a joyful song to the Lord ; sing praise .
te	2	We had delicious melons and cucumbers from our own soil .
te	3	But even this was good and the time went fast .
te	3	But this was rainwater , was it not ?
te	4	Had it been living water when we filled the mikvah ?
te	1	" Pharisees say all these things are Laws . "
te	4	" We do the best we can do .
te	4	We went down into Egypt in the time of Joseph .
te	2	Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is One .
te	4	Jews all over the world kept the sacred Feasts .
te	3	It was not safe yet to travel to the Temple .
te	2	The fire signals coming from Jerusalem told us all was well .
te	2	It was a " glorious thing to behold . "
te	2	He had come out of the Holy of Holies safely .
te	2	That 's our King of the Jews for you . "
te	2	" You saw a city second only to Rome . "
te	2	I 'd forgotten Joseph 's order to me not to ask .
te	0	I felt a sharp pain all through me .
te	4	She looked at Joseph and then at me .
te	0	I heard a breathing that I knew was from Old Sarah .
te	3	" What 's this thing you want to say ? "
te	1	" Say it to me , " I said .
te	1	" Men said they saw things , " James said .
te	4	" When you were born , they saw things . "
te	1	I didn 't dare to ask him anything .
te	4	I knew he was telling me the truth .
te	2	My mother told me to go to bed .
te	1	Soon everyone in the room was up and running .
te	3	And what is the story of all this ?
te	4	We had all been strangers once in the Land of Egypt .
te	1	We sang those sweetest Psalms called the Psalms of Praise .
te	3	It was still daylight , but getting on towards dark .
te	1	His black hair and his beard were shining with perfumed oil .
te	2	I don 't know whether or not she will know you .
te	2	So all we could do was go on .
te	4	She looked far older than she had been last year .
te	2	She looked as old as our beloved Sarah .
te	3	We must not worry that we weren 't within the walls .
te	3	But at the very top , those who protect the Temple ?
te	0	And we did have a laugh at that .
te	0	He looked up and his face was dark .
te	3	Let 's put this talk out of our minds . "
te	0	" I say Joseph Caiaphas is a fine young man .
te	0	My aunts , and Alexandra , agreed with this .
te	2	How do you find out these things ! "
te	0	" Perhaps Joseph Caiaphas may be High Priest someday ? "
te	4	Yes , he 'll be High Priest . "
te	0	The full supper was ready and it was a good meal .
te	1	Now I must say that James was almost finished with school .
te	4	He waited a moment , then went on .
te	1	" This is a way it is with Jews .
te	2	And I had been so curious to talk to my cousin .
te	2	This was good to be away on the slope .
te	3	" What 's the matter with you ? "
te	2	Sorry for the mean things I 've said to you .
te	2	Sorry for ... being mean to you . "
te	1	" But it 's all right , " I said .
te	2	I did it to be strong over you ! "
te	1	" I didn 't know , " I said .
te	1	I think I knew but I knew it would pass .
te	1	I didn 't think about it if I knew it . "
te	2	" Listen to your own words , " he said .
te	0	What I hadn 't known was that I was any different .
te	3	I didn 't know what to say to him .
te	1	" Will you let me put my arms around you ? "
te	4	He nodded , and we held each other .
te	1	And I hugged him tight and could feel him trembling .
te	2	" And I can 't tell you all of it .
te	3	" But who is to tell me ? "
te	4	" James , tell me what made you hate me .
te	4	" The angels came when you were born .
te	2	You know how it was , they told you .
te	0	And your mother lay in Aunt Salome 's arms .
te	0	" Christ the Lord , " he said .
te	3	So this is what they kept from me .
te	4	Yes , and I knew why they kept it from me .
te	0	And on Earth , peace and goodwill to all . ' "
te	2	" How could I hate you for this ? "
te	4	" Don 't offer me your kindness , " he said .
te	1	" But you 're my older brother , " I said .
te	1	He lifted his tunic to wipe his tears .
te	2	" But don 't you see , your mother was happy .
te	2	People kept coming to the door , asking to see you .
te	1	I knew him in the dark by his walk .
te	3	I don 't want you this far from the camp . "
te	2	Joseph 's way was to go from day to day .
te	3	But I had to know the rest of this story !
te	4	Were these strange happenings the reason we had gone to Egypt ?
te	3	No , it couldn 't have been that way .
te	3	But what about the angel who appeared to my mother ?
te	2	Stories of a child born who was Christ the Lord !
te	0	Chapter 23 I wasn 't a child anymore .
te	3	My mind was on the unfinished story that James had told .
te	4	" We were purified before we left Nazareth in the mikvah .
te	1	We 're going into the Sanctuary now . "
te	0	" But why do they charge too much , Father ? "
te	3	" I don 't know that they do .
te	4	" We 've come with enough money for the sacrifice .
te	4	It was a long time before we reached the tables .
te	1	" Or bring your own perfect birds from Galilee ?
te	3	The merchant gave the women two fluttering little birds .
te	4	Quickly , he shoved the others into an empty cage .
te	3	Yet I could see that many did not mind it .
te	0	The columns were Greek and as beautiful as any in Alexandria .
te	2	I worried as to how we would find each other .
te	1	" This is a little boy , " he said .
te	1	But the music , the music was all around us .
te	1	There was no beginning or end to any part of it .
te	3	He turned to look at me , that frown still on his face .
te	4	Another rock fell just beside me , clipping my left shoulder on the way down .
te	1	I crawled into it , praying I 'd find Jerzy already there .
te	3	I had to tell them Jerzy hadn 't made it to the flag .
te	2	Footsteps sounded across the room from me , then the voice again .
te	1	" Not an uninjured one in the whole lot , but only one casualty . "
te	1	Joaquim 's darker red hair was visible from a bed near the door .
te	2	Though I didn 't use any words , I was shouting Look out !
te	4	Maybe if I 'd called out , he could have found me .
te	1	It meant we had one less person standing in the way of HEX and Binary .
te	0	I wasn 't benched because I had PTSD , I was on probation .
te	2	I still didn 't know all of them , at least not personally .
te	4	I 'd been just another recruit , aside from my friendship with Hue .
te	2	A tray plunked down opposite me , and I looked up to see Joaquim .
te	2	" Hey , " I offered , trying for a normal tone of voice .
te	2	" Joey ... you know a lot of people are blaming you , right ? "
te	0	The Old Man had said any actual injuries would be investigated thoroughly .
te	4	Joey Harker , who 'd fought with Jerzy right before he 'd been killed .
te	0	" Okay , " I said , and put my head in one hand .
te	4	I started toward it , depression settling more heavily over me with every step .
te	1	It infuriated me that he 'd died on a training mission , of all things .
te	4	It must have been dislodged when I 'd pulled the flag free .
te	3	I wouldn 't know until I could get it back to a charger .
te	2	I looked at Hue , who was bobbing and sporting his pleased color .
te	2	A question I could answer honestly , and someone I could talk to .
te	2	I 'm tired of being kept out of the loop for my own good .
te	0	I didn 't really want to know , but I asked anyway .
te	4	And will , if she deems it necessary for the good of continuity . "
te	3	I couldn 't argue with that , but I sure as hell wanted to .
te	3	" But - " It was too late ; the conversation was over .
te	3	It hurts so much that at first you can 't even tell where it hurts .
te	4	He was still my friend and teammate ; what else could I do ?
te	2	He ignored the command , as I 'd assumed he would , and fired again .
te	3	That meant he was motivated , at least in part , by his ego .
te	3	Unfortunately , I wasn 't going to get the chance to try reaching him .
te	3	" I don 't know what 's gotten into you , but quit it !
te	4	I sat up carefully , using one arm to push myself to my feet .
te	0	" Close call , " Acacia said suddenly , turning to look amiably at me .
te	3	My grip on this plane is a little more tenuous than yours .
te	4	" Is what they say in all the science fiction novels true ?
te	2	" So why can 't you just do the same thing over and over ? "
te	0	Acacia 's voice was remarkably steady for someone who had just been shot .
te	2	I finally took a moment to look around , not that I could see much .
te	0	Acacia 's voice drifted up from my lap , weak and strained .
te	3	It was starting to make a little more sense , sort of .
te	2	I looked around at the figures , misty and distorted , walking around us .
te	3	I 've got ta recharge it , now ... that was a strong blast . "
te	0	Acacia held her hand out , palm up , fingers bent and apart .
te	3	Twenty , not the full thirty it usually took to fully charge a disk .
te	3	The number is FB two forty-two , and my mother 's birthday is February twenty-fourth .
te	1	I left it behind ; I didn 't have a choice . "
te	3	I started to scramble to my feet , but Acacia grabbed my wrist .
te	2	" I don 't know how to , anyway , " I told her .
te	0	" They do that , " she said , her voice shaky .
te	0	She whirled around , and I almost fell at the abrupt lack of support .
te	0	" The Binary , " I managed , as Acacia just looked at me .
te	2	" He comes from a world closer to the technological end of the Arc .
te	1	I think ... " I fell silent , and Acacia nudged me with a shoulder .
te	4	Something backfired , and ... he was unconscious when I rejoined the team .
te	0	" Even my world has that , and we 're not half as advanced ! "
te	3	Acacia snorted , but I was too upset to find it even faintly funny .
te	4	She paused , then went on , though seemingly reluctant to do so .
te	2	" I don 't think you should go back yet , Joe . "
te	0	For an instant , I was terrified that Acacia had done the same .
te	1	I was only half conscious when I felt ground beneath me again .
te	3	I tried to turn my head to either side , and couldn 't .
te	0	Acacia took me through several halls and rooms , and into something resembling an elevator .
te	2	Acacia moved me through one set of bars , into a small room .
te	0	" I 'm sorry , Joe , " she said , and walked away .
te	3	" It 's her job to protect the future , " I snapped .
te	0	His mouth hadn 't moved , but I knew the words had come from him .
te	3	" You will not find her here if you attempt to run .
te	1	I kicked at him , not sure what I was expecting this time .
te	1	Constellations I hadn 't seen in I didn 't even know how long .
te	1	The Little and Big Dippers , Orion , Cassiopeia , the Lion .
te	1	I found the Old Man 's office with not a single wrong turn .
te	4	The furniture was overturned , obviously having been used as a barricade at some point .
te	2	I climbed over the door , into the Old Man 's office .
te	3	I gave a thought to going through them , then decided I didn 't care .
te	1	A necklace hung next to it , dangling half over an embroidered napkin .
te	1	That flash , brief as it had been , had ruined my night vision .
te	0	I wasn 't even sure what I could tell them about Acacia .
te	1	I couldn 't help anyone if I was thrown in jail or kicked out again .
te	3	He wasn 't happy about this , but he 'd do it .
te	3	He was no temperature at all , which just contributed to the oddness .
te	0	Joaquim said , then turned as Acacia began to struggle and spew curses .
te	0	He half turned , stretching out a hand , and Acacia shouted again .
te	0	I grabbed up a chair and swung it full force as I ran .
te	1	Joaquim was just outside it , and he was sort of ... flying .
te	2	I glanced at Acacia , looking for some sort of recognition or understanding .
te	4	All the Walkers who 've ever been captured ... " You finally get it . "
te	0	I caught her halfway down , and I think I said her name .
te	1	" Drain him , " said the Professor , but Joaquim hesitated .
te	2	He 'd looked at me , and warned me , and died .
te	3	I was surrounded by metal , but it was more than that .
te	3	Thin , prickly fingers of dread began to clutch at my stomach .
te	0	Joaquim was strapped in as well , and didn 't seem at all concerned .
te	0	and made a serious attempt at lifting my head to look around .
te	3	Whatever this was , I didn 't want any part of it .
te	2	" Okay , " I said slowly , trying to work all this out .
te	1	I didn 't know , and I didn 't want to know .
te	1	It was misty , ice blue , and roiling like it contained a storm .
te	2	You will fulfill your purpose and bring about the revolution of the world . "
te	0	I called it back to me , commanded it , and grabbed Joaquim 's hand .
te	1	I was standing now , no longer caged , no longer captive .
te	1	They would do as I asked , I was sure of it .
te	3	I turned back to Joaquim and the machine , stretching out my other hand .
te	0	I stumbled away from her , moving toward Joaquim and the machine .
te	2	I took two steps toward Joaquim , before I stopped in my tracks .
te	0	I can run as fast and as far as I need to . "
te	1	" Joaquim had his memories , " I said quietly , taking her hands .
te	4	Taking their power , like the machine tried to do to me ? "
te	3	They 're just ... I don 't know that they 're coming , Joe . "
te	2	Worst of all , it was completely silent , like an animal stalking its prey .
te	3	As I watched , it turned brown and brittle , dying right beneath me .
te	0	And you will not be able to Walk far enough away . "
te	2	I had time for about two seconds of abject panic before I hit the ground .
te	2	I was alone ... back on the world I 'd just come from ?
te	1	No ... I could hear something in the distance , a familiar sound .
te	3	I managed to get to my feet , making my way toward them .
te	2	I wouldn 't let a few broken bones stop me , not now .
te	0	The sun was hot and my chest was heaving as I looked at him .
te	4	It seemed the whole street went quiet except for the carpenters ' hammers .
te	4	She clutched me so close to her , I could scarcely breathe .
te	2	My little cousins were slipping through the door one by one and crowding around us .
te	0	" I saw it when he made the sparrows out of clay on the Sabbath .
te	0	The teacher told him he shouldn 't do such things on the Sabbath .
te	0	His mouth was open and his white teeth showed over his lip .
te	4	His mother turned and she saw it was me and she screamed .
te	2	he shouted , mocking me , " Son of David , Son of David ! "
te	3	He was trying to move , but the crowd wouldn 't let him .
te	2	" Oh , look what 's happened to you , " she said .
te	4	She spoke in Aramaic , our tongue which we didn 't speak very much .
te	0	" The Lord made shame for an argument such as this ! "
te	4	" And as it happens , we are going home to Galilee . "
te	3	" That has nothing to do with it , " said Joseph .
te	4	" Do you even understand Hebrew , and you call yourself a Teacher ! "
te	2	Following it with " Now do you know what that means ? "
te	1	" And to take this child , this brilliant child - . "
te	3	" Oh , you think people don 't talk about these things ? "
te	4	asked the Teacher , " when he hears that you 're taking Jesus ? "
te	3	But to talk of this now , that Philo had taken a liking to me ?
te	1	Philo thinks Jesus is the most promising scholar he 's ever seen .
te	2	" You want to be educated by Philo , don 't you ? "
te	4	" Yes , yes , and you take them back to - where was it ?
te	3	The Teacher couldn 't say anything to this , but only nodded .
te	0	Joseph was my father and Joseph must take me back to Nazareth .
te	2	You go home because your father wants you to go home . "
te	3	But I was too excited to be returning to the Holy Land .
te	1	" That 's just it , " said Joseph who sat beside her .
te	1	She was strong for me as always , not the child she was with Joseph .
te	2	" I don 't want you to ask , do you understand ? "
te	3	And I knew it was a great secret , this that they talked about .
te	3	To talk of such things outside the family , that could never happen .
te	0	And all this meant coming home after dark , tired and hungry .
te	2	It would cost us , everybody knew , but Joseph said we would do it .
te	4	And it seemed the whole street turned out to see us off .
te	3	Now many times , I 'd looked out to sea at the Great Lighthouse .
te	0	He was a tall man with very dark skin and richly dressed .
te	4	I want the men who served his father in this to be punished .
te	4	It flowed easily like Greek did from our Teacher , or from Philo .
te	4	I tell you there has to be a reckoning for the things he did . "
te	4	But the taller one , the calm one , was already answering me .
te	2	I understood him though his words were not so simple to understand .
te	0	The angry man said , " Don 't take him away , let him learn .
te	1	" But for us , we lived with him and his monstrosities .
te	1	" Yes , you must see Jerusalem first , " she said sadly .
te	0	My aunt shook her head as if to say let it all go .
te	3	But Joseph sat quietly away from all of this just thinking to himself .
te	4	And for him , he 'd go to Jerusalem , even if there were trouble .
te	2	he said to Joseph , " if you mean to go on to Galilee ! "
te	0	He said he wanted to bathe now , and Aunt Mary said he couldn 't .
te	1	We had known about the Law ever since we had known anything .
te	1	I did it , sitting at his right hand , crossing my legs .
te	2	" I 'm going to tell you something , " he said to me .
te	3	That was what he 'd said on the boat , wasn 't it ?
te	4	His chest rose and fell with each rattling breath and again he shivered .
te	1	I was as surprised as he was by what I 'd said .
te	0	And must you be a child first before you are a man ?
te	3	And half the time they don 't know what to do with you !
te	1	I was so surprised I didn 't know what to say to her .
te	0	" What I have to say to you should have waited , " she said .
te	0	Beautiful perhaps as Sarah looked to Pharaoh , beautiful as Rachel to Jacob .
te	0	" And so it happened , " she said , looking up again .
te	4	She wasn 't like a girl now , but not like a woman either .
te	0	All of us went back again like a wave in the sea .
te	1	Even my tunic was caught up against those in front and behind me .
te	3	I pulled free of the hands that tried to tug at me .
te	4	He drew a stone from under his robe and thew it at the soldier .
te	4	The man dropped the stone he held , and fell back with his eyes wide .
te	2	Little Salome screamed , " Don 't look , don 't look . "
te	1	I could only hear it , and the terrible noise of its running wild .
te	3	Who had come into this Temple that did not carry stones for this war ?
te	4	At last the soldiers were everywhere , so many soldiers I could never count them .
te	2	said Joseph to me , breaking his chant for only a moment .
te	2	" Look , " he said to anyone who could hear him .
te	4	" They had sense enough to run for cover , didn 't they ?
te	4	I think they were in their fine robes and headdresses , but maybe not .
te	3	" But is it right to leave now of all times ? "
te	0	She had the child in her arms , and she would be all right .
te	1	" Yes , and how many innocents did they slay in there just now ? "
te	4	The men began to give out coins where they could , as others did .
te	3	He 'd brought his stones to the Temple so that he might throw them .
te	2	I saw it over and over , and the look on his face .
te	2	" It was a good moment to die , " he said .
te	2	I don 't care what you think , you say nothing more . "
te	1	I started to cry and I didn 't know why I was crying .
te	3	I felt I couldn 't breathe , and I couldn 't stop it .
te	1	So many riders passing us , and so quickly and no more Jerusalem .
te	1	Again came the noise , the noise of horses rushing past , and screams outside .
te	4	Little Salome was shrieking with excitement the way she shrieked when we played .
te	4	" You can see how they run rampant to celebrate the death of Old Herod .
te	1	" My brother , " said my mother , " I 'm going mad ! "
te	1	Lie against your mother 's breast , here , and stop your crying .
te	4	But then I felt purely drowsy , and I felt so safe .
te	1	I wasn 't afraid now , and I didn 't know why .
te	2	" You stupid fools , don 't you know what 's happening in Israel ? "
te	3	I 'll cut your throats one by one , starting with the children ! "
te	2	Do not let it be said of you that you shed innocent blood . "
te	1	" Oh , you stupid worthless peasants , " he said in Greek .
te	4	" They 've never seen any money in their lives , " said the other .
te	4	All at once we children rushed to the doors of the little house .
te	4	" To send that child to people who don 't even worship in the Temple !
te	0	And he , the child himself , wants this and he has reason . "
te	4	He stared at me and I could see only a calmness in him .
te	2	You don 't speak to a woman when you speak to me .
te	1	" If you must speak against his mother , then speak . "
te	0	Then the cough came up in his chest , and he was in pain .
te	0	Never had I heard a woman speak with this kind of authority .
te	3	Surely it is right for John and Yeshua to be brought up together . "
te	3	I didn 't dare to ask the question that was on my lips .
te	1	" We knew nothing of this , " Joseph said in a whisper .
te	4	" And do you think I have gone into the Temple since ?
te	3	But I couldn 't think now except in bursts of curiosity and fear .
te	4	There are Pharisees , there are the priests , there are the Essenes .
te	3	I didn 't want to say anything about the things that troubled me .
te	1	We 've known this for as long as we 've known anything .
te	3	" A thousand years is nothing but a moment to the Lord . "
te	0	We have good daylight and we can go far before making our camps . "
te	4	I want to see the palace of Herod where they burned it . "
te	3	" And that 's what we 'd like to do right now . "
te	2	" Praise to the Lord , Praise to the Lord , my soul , sing !
te	2	I needed to hold on to him or I would have fallen .
te	4	" But we 're here and we 're home , " I said .
te	4	He 's out there over by the river singing with them , talking .
te	3	And then the worries , but I didn 't want to hear it .
te	0	An angel had told Joseph to bring us back , I had heard it said .
te	2	It was like opening a wooden door , or pulling back a curtain .
te	2	That 's how to do it , so that no one knows .
te	1	But Father in Heaven , I did do it , didn 't I ?
te	2	You come , but you don 't know what I know , do you ?
te	0	But we were inland , and the land was rocky and the paths hard .
te	2	Those who passed us on the road brought stories of more riots in Jerusalem .
te	4	We keep the Sabbath , we 're not required to join in the army .
te	3	They don 't have time to listen to you tell them you 've done nothing .
te	4	" Don 't be frightened , " said Joseph in a low voice .
te	2	" How are we to know the will of the Lord ? "
te	4	Little Judas and Symeon snuggled up next to me , without even waking up .
te	0	Against the faraway flames , I saw the man rise up and stop .
te	4	And from everyone else nothing except the women shushing the hurt one .
te	0	" Go back to your bed , " said James again to me .
te	3	I stood up , said the morning prayers with my arms outstretched .
te	1	He rules from there , but the Romans are already on the march from Syria .
te	3	And when I thought of this , all the questions came back to me .
te	3	But I was too eager to see Nazareth to think of all this just now .
te	0	And the woman with her hands up , shaking her head , left them .
te	0	They all came back and lay down , and became quiet again .
te	3	Silas and Levi were sticking out their lips that they couldn 't go with James .
te	4	In the courtyard was the biggest fig tree I 'd ever seen .
te	4	Little Symeon began to howl , but I 'm not sure he knew why .
te	1	They had said " crucify , " and I knew what crucifixion was .
te	3	" You can 't tell me this town didn 't support the rebels .
te	2	" No , take me if someone is to go , " said Joseph .
te	2	I don 't know what I 'm accused of , but I 'll go . "
te	1	" Don 't you see , this is why I didn 't die in Jerusalem .
te	4	" I 'll go with you , " he said to the leader .
te	2	" Stop it , all of you now , " shouted the leader .
te	4	It 's in Greek , written by the scribe of the Street of the Carpenters .
te	0	And a good part of the city has gone up in flames .
te	2	" What you have to do is a hard thing to do . "
te	1	" It is a hard thing to do , " said the soldier .
te	1	As for this village , let it be as it is . "
te	2	All of you come here to Old Sarah , " she said to us children .
te	2	We went through four rooms in a row before we found him .
te	2	Joseph said our names to the old man but he only looked at me .
te	0	And kin to Joseph and to my mother , just as Old Sarah was .
te	4	If there was anyone else in the town , we didn 't know it .
te	0	Old Sarah said for us to have patience , and have faith in the Lord .
te	2	Joseph shook his head , and took James with him to work .
te	2	An old man came to the gate , nodded and moved on .
te	4	" Pray they never have to come back , " my mother said .
te	3	" You mustn 't talk about what you hear at our fire .
te	2	" We 'll harrow this tomorrow for the women , " he said .
te	1	I wanted so badly to find words , words like those in the Psalms .
te	4	But I loved to be up there and look out over the valley .
te	4	The afternoon we finished refilling the pool we all gathered around it .
te	3	They had to go to the spring outside the village and bring it back .
te	0	I thought of what Joseph had said to Philo , as we studied .
te	0	Joseph said as he put on the face of the angry Captain .
te	1	" Who can know if the Lord will turn and repent of his anger ? "
te	3	Who stomped out of the city gates in a fit of temper ! "
te	0	Was this not why I ran away on a ship to Tarshish ? ' "
te	3	' For it 's better that I die than to live ! ' "
te	1	When morning came it was still the Sabbath and would be until sundown .
te	1	Now she said , " Is there no synagogue in this town now ?
te	3	We went towards it , and had to wait our turn as others went inside .
te	1	Then Joseph spoke : " He is my son , " said Joseph .
te	0	The bearded man kept his hand in my way , but his face was kind .
te	4	Then came the voice of Old Sarah , as clear as before .
te	4	No matter where I looked , I knew that the Rabbi turned around .
te	3	Then the other two boys got up and came over and sat with us .
te	3	And for the first time I thought : my mother didn 't come .
te	4	She looked at Joseph and I saw the question in her eyes .
te	2	And my mother told them what words of comfort she had to give .
te	2	They took my son , my only son , he 's gone !
te	3	That 's the way it is with war , little or great .
te	3	There was no psalm with an ant in it that we knew .
te	1	" I didn 't listen to you in Egypt , " said his wife .
te	1	And the little ones were playing in the courtyard and running through the rooms .
te	0	I looked up and saw that the old man was looking directly at me .
te	1	" James and Silas and Levi , I know , but Jesus bar Joseph ? "
te	0	" I am the child 's father by the Law , " said Joseph .
te	3	" And after that you went on to Egypt , " said the Rabbi .
te	1	I blushed but I didn 't know for what I was blushing .
te	1	" I beg the Rabbi to forgive me , " I said in Aramaic .
te	0	This I had always known as long as I knew any answer .
te	1	" Yes , it was , " said the Old Rabbi , smiling .
te	3	I still didn 't wipe my tears , but they 'd stopped .
te	0	I was as tired as if we 'd laid marble pavers all day .
te	4	Or worse yet screaming and crying over what was being read to them .
te	0	And this made the people happy and they went away thanking us and thanking him .
te	2	Now I should say a lot of people came to Old Sarah .
te	4	I struggled to remember the things my mother had said to me .
te	1	I thought when I could , but ours was a busy life .
te	3	What time there was from work , I went to the Rabbis .
te	0	He made a sound which showed his disgust for the family of Herod .
te	0	He said it as if he was angry , but he wasn 't .
te	4	For the first time it seemed to me that sleep was a place .
te	2	" That 's your doom that you don 't know how it will end . "
te	1	It was a grown man 's broken crying , which I 'd almost never seen .
te	0	" You know that I am what I am from love , " he said .
te	3	I was not angry or excited , but I wanted him to understand .
te	1	I knew that if I wanted to , I could answer him .
te	1	I lay in the dark room , covered in sweat and thirsting .
te	3	That creature wanted to come again , but I wouldn 't let him come .
te	2	" Do you think the Lord in Heaven had to take one of us ? "
te	4	" And when I was spared , he took her in my place ? "
te	2	And I trusted in what my uncles and Joseph said to do .
te	0	Little Symeon was happy and he hardly knew what this was about .
te	2	" And who else do you think such a smell would drive off ! "
te	0	She shook her head , and laughed , and they all broke into laughing again .
te	4	There were many funny parts in the story and we knew them all .
te	4	And the Roman arrows couldn 't reach the Jews because of their position .
te	3	Though it was warm , I felt cold as he went on . "
te	4	" Who knows the lineage of the priest in the Temple at this hour ? "
te	2	Wildflowers bloomed in the grass , some tall , and others small .
te	3	I wanted it that way - the sky in bits and pieces .
te	1	I did think of those things ... but I loved this place .
te	1	" I 'm very happy , " I said as I climbed to my feet .
te	3	" I come here and I think and my thoughts turn to prayers . "
te	3	" You mustn 't worry about all those struggles , those defeats .
te	0	" You want it this way , that we always have Caesar ? "
te	1	" And when a man doesn 't understand , he can 't explain . "
te	3	But Joseph 's way is to wait , wait on the Lord himself .
te	4	Joseph doesn 't have to understand , because Joseph trusts in the Lord completely .
te	2	" And not to me , but ... " I broke off .
te	2	" Speak , go on , I 'm listening to you . "
te	3	" What does it matter who is collecting the taxes or catching the thieves ?
te	3	But then I didn 't care that he burnt the two palaces of Herod .
te	1	There was a woman singing in her garden , and little ones playing .
te	3	" What was it , up there , that you were going to tell me ?
te	1	In a small voice I said , " I want to know . "
te	2	We looked at each other , and I was the one to look away .
te	1	And there were laborers aplenty for us to hire for our work .
te	0	She had grown up overnight , and was always tending to a baby .
te	3	But my mother didn 't talk much of those days in Jerusalem .
te	2	Our kindred who had not come to talk were now coming often .
te	3	But that is the way it is , and the way it was .
te	1	I 'd feel my skin all over and then I 'd stop thinking about it .
te	4	As the air grew cooler , the early rains came with great force .
te	4	Thunder roared over the rooftop , and everyone offered prayers of thanks .
te	4	We did not have to be at the Temple to keep the sacred Feasts .
te	4	In a cleansed and renewed Temple , the High Priest had completed his task .
te	3	" No , " said my mother , " it 's true .
te	1	" I 'm sorry that I said it , " I whispered .
te	0	My brother James had a hard look on his face as he stared at me .
te	4	" Everyone in Bethlehem saw those magi come , and their servants with them .
te	2	And my older cousins had wandered in from where I didn 't know .
te	3	Before I could ask what it was , I went with them .
te	1	I knew many new words to think in my head about what I 'd seen .
te	0	Riba was a joy to the women , said my aunt Salome .
te	1	I wanted my mother and I didn 't want anyone to know it .
te	2	Joseph lifted me up but I was too big now to be on his shoulders .
te	0	He had a bright face , and he welcomed us with his arms out .
te	1	" This is your cousin Joseph , " my mother said immediately .
te	2	" Do you have good things to say of them , old woman ? "
te	3	Who do you think would listen to them if they weren 't rich ? "
te	2	" No , he was not poor , " said Old Sarah .
te	3	For the first time I saw that James was deep in his thoughts .
te	0	" Yes , let 's put it away , " said Old Sarah .
te	4	He was thirteen years old now , and a man before the Lord .
te	2	And Silas and Levi who were older than that didn 't go to school anymore .
te	3	It was getting dark , and the city below was full of light .
te	3	" I had no right to tell you about the magi coming to Bethlehem . "
te	3	" But you told me what I wanted to know , " I said .
te	4	He looked at me and it seemed his face was full of hate .
te	2	" I 'll tell you why I must love you , " he said .
te	4	" You mean the angel who came to my mother , " I said .
te	0	She was all wrapped up and the rags from the birth had been taken away .
te	4	But these men were there , and a boy with them and a lantern .
te	0	I had to know what the angel had said who had come to my mother .
te	3	And the magi from the East , they came to that house .
te	3	I knew it when I watched the other children that morning at play .
te	3	At last , we were in the tunnel moving upwards toward the Great Court .
te	1	For what sin James wanted to make this sacrifice I didn 't know .
te	0	She asked a question in an Aramaic that was different from ours .
te	2	" Not in the House of the Lord , " said Joseph .
te	4	And the stones were hard under my feet , though they were beautiful stones .
te	0	The stench of the cages was worse than any courtyard in Nazareth .
te	3	A family had returned with birds that the priests wouldn 't accept .
te	4	The merchant shouted in Greek that the birds had been unblemished when he sold them .
te	3	I saw the little lambs and the goats going to the sacrifice .
te	3	I made them out through the goings and comings of the priests .
te	2	Your mother was among those who wove those veils , two a year .
te	2	They would wring the neck of one bird and pour out its blood .
te	4	Old Sarah at once received James in her arms and kissed him .
te	1	Finally I asked Joseph if I might give him something and go listen to him .
te	4	It was beautiful Greek he was speaking , smooth as Philo would have spoken it .
te	2	" A Son of Israel or one seeking the Lord of All ? "
te	1	" A student who seeks the wisdom of your gray hairs . "
te	0	" Oh , that old story , child , " he said .
te	2	" We will know when the Messiah comes , how can we not know ? "
te	0	" That was too dreadful , and who knows what really happened ?
te	2	Only Herod could have done such a thing , a bloodthirsty and evil man !
te	1	And I held tight to him and I prayed in my heart for him .
te	3	At the top of the stairs into the tunnel , Joseph stopped .
te	2	Not one word did he say to me on the way home .
te	1	At night there was much music and even dancing in Bethany among the camps .
te	3	I paid attention to things that before I would not have noticed .
te	3	I went to the road now that led down to the Temple .
te	1	He was well dressed and he had his blue threads sewn in his tassels .
te	1	I heard all this , but it didn 't go deep into my mind .
te	1	I can 't eat or drink until I find out about this child . "
te	4	" We told him Bethlehem would be the birthplace of the Messiah .
te	3	So we answered , not with cunning , but with the truth .
te	4	And when Herod discovered this deception , he went into a rage .
te	0	I began to shake and to cry with all my body and my soul .
te	1	" My son , " he said , " my son . "
te	3	My throat hurt but I knew it was only from not talking .
te	4	" Come , I have fresh clothes for you , " said the younger man .
te	2	I don 't think I 'd ever sat on a stool before .
te	1	" Mother , I must know things now , " I said .
te	3	" Don 't say anything to me as I tell it . "
te	1	" Now one morning , I 'd awakened early and I didn 't know why .
te	3	It was a light that didn 't hurt my eyes but it was absolutely bright .
te	2	It said the Holy Child born from me would be the Son of God . "
te	0	" The hardest part was to tell Joseph bar Jacob , " she said .
te	3	He didn 't cry out in the streets about this as I had .
te	4	" I knew we had to leave Bethlehem , " she said .
te	1	And all this while I didn 't know why we were running .
te	1	He 'd sent soldiers down from his fortress only a few miles away .
te	2	" I said to Joseph , ' Did you know that was going to happen ?
te	2	I felt , ' We have blood on our hands ! ' "
te	2	Not the Son of God as an anointed King is called the Son of God !
te	3	Oh , I know how much you want to stay at the Temple .
te	3	I looked up at the first few stars coming through the twilight .
te	1	The pain was so terrible I didn 't think I could bear it .
te	1	I would go home crying if I didn 't stop thinking of it .
te	3	I read a sentence that said the Protestant Reformation split Europe culturally in half .
te	3	I wrote two novels during this period that reflect what I was doing .
te	3	It set into motion the idea that there may in fact be God .
te	3	In August , I went to my beach apartment , to write the book .
te	0	As I began my serious work , a call came from my husband .
te	0	Before that he had managed , though half paralyzed , to create three amazing paintings .
te	0	I went on with my quest right through his illness and his death .
te	0	I have the old Catholic translation , and every literary translation I can find .
te	0	Absurd conclusions were reached on the basis of little or no data at all .
te	3	If they do , the person is usually not the focus of the study .
te	2	What looks like solid ground might not be solid ground at all .
te	4	I had never truly confronted these events before , never tried to comprehend them .
te	3	Would Christian writers not have written about it had they seen it ?
te	1	I can only recommend him without reservation , and go on studying him .
te	1	I could append to this a bibliography of stifling length but I will not .
te	4	A creature seven feet in height can 't avoid the eyes of people .
te	0	But a rather amusing thing had happened in the last two hundred years .
te	1	Hundreds could be given to schools , hospitals , other such institutions .
te	4	Unlike his joyless colleagues , with each of his triumphs he had taken greater risks .
te	0	But who would have imagined that such things would have caught his fancy ?
te	4	The snow had begun again , with flakes so tiny he could barely see them .
te	0	The scribes of Jericho would have understood this shift , he thought .
te	1	" You 're afraid I 'll frighten her , aren 't you ? "
te	0	She looked at his hands , at the fingers , and at the palms .
te	3	It brings out not the obsequious but the more thoughtful side of humans .
te	4	He gave her hands a tender squeeze and then he let them go .
te	1	" I admire your work , Miss Paget , " he said .
te	1	" I want your dolls , Miss Paget , " he said .
te	2	" Miss Paget , you need someone to bargain for you ! "
te	4	Her eyes had brightened , but they were not filling with tears .
te	2	" You know you 'll be rich soon , Miss Paget . "
te	4	" But don 't be sure you will enjoy the process here .
te	0	As you have observed , manufacture is not the same thing as crafting or creating .
te	1	" I 'm so glad , Miss Paget , " he said .
te	2	He nodded as if to say , This is not important , go on .
te	1	Humans are skilled at recognizing their own kind , tribe , clan , family .
te	0	" Now , what made you say that , Miss Paget ? "
te	1	She 'd conclude he was past forty , and carefully fighting fifty .
te	2	Oh , he couldn 't think of something so awful just now .
te	1	Once again he turned to the windows , and to the falling snow .
te	1	It sounded as if you said - " " I did say this .
te	0	If his brothers in London catch sight of him , he 'll be dead . "
te	0	Gray hair , now that was gray hair , an entire head of it .
te	0	There were so many thoughts racing through his head , such a clatter of emotion !
te	3	You must arrange everything so that this little man has exactly what he wants .
te	4	As the wires and phones themselves improved , they had talked often .
te	4	Why , it might be very soon , for all he knew .
te	1	His car had crossed the river , and was speeding towards the airport .
te	4	He knew this young woman , but he couldn 't remember her name .
te	4	Shameful not to have her name on the very tip of his tongue .
te	1	he asked , smiling , begging forgiveness with a little bit of a frown .
te	1	" No , sir , Leslie , " she said , forgiving him instantly .
te	4	She looked at the wall , or the flowers , or the yew trees .
te	0	Groups came across the lawn , standing back as if they might hurt her .
te	2	But Rowan didn 't look at the guy or say a word .
te	2	" Your dream is coming into being , " she told Rowan .
te	1	" Of course , he 's a grown man , " she said .
te	0	But Mona could swear there was a vague acknowledgment in Rowan that Mona was there .
te	2	Maybe it was only that Rowan didn 't look annoyed , or sealed off .
te	0	It was bound to happen , finding a throwback like Mary Jane .
te	0	" I knew about y ' all , " Mary Jane had declared .
te	4	" I come over here sometimes and look at you , " said Mary Jane .
te	3	His tryst with Mona had been no freak of nature or twist of witchcraft .
te	3	" That 's what you 're doing here , isn 't it ?
te	1	Darling Mary Jane , you ought to bring your grandmother up here immediately .
te	1	" I don 't think anything that wild will ever happen to this family again .
te	4	" But you did read the file , " Celia had pressed .
te	4	She slapped her slender , tanned little thigh and shrieked with laughter .
te	2	' Course , I didn 't want to go to school then .
te	4	Of course , none of the other witches in this family knew it either .
te	4	" Darlin ' , she made the best homemade ice cream that I ever tasted .
te	1	I could tell you some terrible things about my time in Florida .
te	0	Yeah , I been there , and in Alabama for a while , too .
te	2	I had to sort of work my way back down here . "
te	2	Only thing , Mona had no memory of any other little girl there .
te	0	That was fine music you had at your wedding , Michael Curry .
te	0	" Oh , you are in your heart , " said Celia .
te	2	We had bees , you know , on the porch for honey ?
te	4	Why , I 'd just pick all I wanted right there where the road forks .
te	0	" Honey , that 's against the law , " said Bea .
te	1	I had a couple of things going for me , I did .
te	3	" You got it , that 's right , now how did you know that ?
te	0	Or at least they had not known her as an old lady .
te	0	" Hell , she 's not dead , " Mary Jane had said .
te	2	" Do you want to go to school , Mary Jane ? "
te	1	" This story about your granny , you 're serious , this really happened ?
te	0	Mary Jane , you can care for this old lady all by yourself ? "
te	4	" Of course , we got them fresh linen , new things .
te	0	" Hey , you don 't have a sixth finger , " said Mona .
te	2	" My mother had some doctor in Los Angeles chop it off .
te	2	When do you say ' whom ' instead of ' who , ' exactly ? "
te	2	" Mary Jane , I 'm going to call your mother . "
te	2	You know what kind a ' doctor cut off my sixth finger in L.A. ?
te	3	If this didn 't snap Rowan to , then a tornado wouldn 't do it .
te	3	But in truth , she had wanted to believe that Mary Jane was right .
te	3	Well , it wouldn 't be hard to verify that , would it ?
te	2	Maybe Mary Jane 's big gush of words had been good for Rowan .
te	4	" I don 't want to be the designee of the legacy !
te	0	Mona gave a sigh , a pretty spoiled and petulant thing to do , really .
te	1	" I didn 't mean it with Michael , " she said aloud to Rowan .
te	0	Her hands lay in her lap in the most natural little heap .
te	0	And wasn 't as careful that night as I should have been .
te	4	He looked at me the way he looked later at that kid , Mary Jane .
te	0	" Beatrice thinks raw eggs are dangerous , and she has a point .
te	4	I wanted to call everyone , tell them she was all right .
te	3	" I don 't think you hurt her at all , Mona .
te	3	Maybe it was better if you didn 't know about the egg .
te	0	All that time she was in the coma , she heard things .
te	2	" Michael , for the love of God , she will be all right .
te	3	If that 's what it is , she 'll get better . "
te	1	" Having a linen napkin , " he said , " anytime you want it .
te	0	" Have you told Aaron that you haven 't heard from him ? "
te	3	But he 's not going back to Europe , no matter what happens .
te	0	He was looking at her in a calm but almost cold fashion .
te	4	Men were always complaining about how the sight of sexy women aroused them .
te	1	Rowan was frowning slightly , as if weighing something in her mind .
te	3	She was still looking at the distant flowers , at the wall .
te	2	She did blink naturally and slowly as she swallowed , but that was all .
te	0	He talked about her to Mona , as if Rowan couldn 't hear .
te	3	" I could take her to the hospital for the tests , of course .
te	3	It had been rough , though , and sort of terrible to watch .
te	0	Perhaps she didn 't want to appear to be Michael 's ally .
te	4	Her guilt just hung all over her all the time these days .
te	2	" I 'm too young to know certain things , " she said .
te	1	And then the sudden , alarming sound of a woman crying or laughing .
te	0	" They did it , Rowan , " said Bea , gasping for breath .
te	1	She continued to nod , as Mona and Rowan closed against her .
te	4	Was there time for Michael to be amazed , for Mona to be flabbergasted ?
te	3	And thank God she had not sat still and silent through this moment !
te	4	Three HE HAD PROMISED the little man he would enter the hotel moments after .
te	0	Only then had he heard their baritone chants , their words thoroughly unrecognizable to him .
te	3	The soft strains of a string quartet came from the nearby bar .
te	1	" Come inside , sit down , " said the dwarf impatiently .
te	0	He drummed his short fingers on the cloth arms of the chair .
te	1	" Yes , I know that for certain , " said Yuri .
te	3	He was not going to laugh at this , but it was horribly amusing .
te	4	Are you sure these evil people came from the Order itself ? "
te	0	He sat very straight , as though never ashamed or uneasy about his height .
te	1	The witch family carries an extraordinary set of genes within its various lines .
te	1	" Well , I was educated on their documents in Latin , " said Yuri .
te	2	That is why I 'm asking you : Do they know about you ?
te	2	" You don 't tell lies at all , do you ? "
te	3	" Ash , try not to say strange things , " grumbled the dwarf .
te	4	He looked a little annoyed and then his eyes returned to Yuri .
te	1	" Realism in fiction , and journalism which is filled with colloquialisms .
te	3	But he didn 't trust them and he didn 't go with them .
te	0	" Yuri , Aaron Lightner 's dead , " said the woman .
te	1	He didn 't think or visualize anything or rush to any conclusion .
te	2	And the soft pastel colors of the bedroom lulled him for a moment .
te	1	Alienation , a lack of trust either in happiness or in others .
te	0	" Aaron ... Aaron was my father , " Yuri said in a monotone .
te	0	The little man had brought him a white shirt , still wrapped around laundry cardboard .
te	3	Yuri took it , opened it , unbuttoned it , and slipped it on .
te	3	They must let the Order sink back into its routines , undisturbed by all this .
te	3	They must be anxious to prevent me entering it at all costs .
te	4	To bring him together with the female ... " He looked up .
te	4	Had he ever been in a room with a sentient being who wasn 't human ?
te	4	He saw her , her remarkable little face and her great veil of red hair .
te	1	Take comfort : your brothers and your sisters are not dupes of the Order itself .
te	3	But I believe that you have hit upon the truth in your considerations .
te	4	But there have been times in the past when the Order has been threatened .
te	1	" Yes , it makes such good sense , " said Yuri .
te	0	His hand was trembling so badly that Mona 's lovely face was out of focus .
te	0	He saw the long , thin fingers of Ash touch the edges of the photograph .
te	1	He pitched forward , sick again , the pain in his shoulder immediately paralyzing him .
te	1	It will be in these records who is a powerful witch and who is not .
te	0	" You may not , " he said again , staring at Ash .
te	0	Then gradually he realized Ash was standing beside him , and looking down at him .
te	2	I 'll come back tomorrow and must find you here when I come . "
te	1	" I think I 'm going mad now , " said Yuri .
te	4	Only in New Orleans , she thought , could it be like this .
te	4	She steadied herself with her left hand and lifted the bloody sheet .
te	2	If he had struggled not to die , that too would be unknown forever .
te	3	Her throat still hurt , but this was of no importance to her whatsoever .
te	3	Rowan met the glance and felt the strength of it , and the warmth .
te	4	Heiress , the one who will bear the child that will carry on the legacy .
te	1	No one knew who had hired the man to run down Aaron Lightner .
te	4	She had seen them pass before her during her long hours in the garden .
te	3	For the most part , they knew very little of what had actually taken place .
te	3	But what was the use of saying something like that to him ?
te	0	What had her new friend , Mona Mayfair , said to her only hours ago ?
te	4	This meant darkening the colors somewhat ; this meant somber , muted , complex .
te	0	She reached out and touched the shadowy beard on his face , on his chin .
te	0	There was almost a throb in his hand as he held her arm .
te	0	" I thought perhaps ... " " No , I 'm healed .
te	2	Day in and day out , I 've told you that I love you ! "
te	1	Well , this man would die if she struck with her invisible rage .
te	2	" I ought to be afraid of you , " he said .
te	0	She lifted her hands and ran them back hard through her hair .
te	1	She felt his soft responsive sighs , thick and heavy and from the chest .
te	2	It was no longer a trek one had to make on horseback .
te	3	As he stepped out onto the metal stairway , the wind caught him by surprise .
te	1	Why climb the mountain and visit these shrines of his past again ?
te	4	Ah , but maybe he would sleep a little , and without dreams .
te	1	The moon , snared in clouds , gave an intermittent and filmy light .
te	3	When at last he stopped , it was upon a high crest .
te	1	Think of the gypsy asleep in his warm bed , dreaming of his witch .
te	0	And slumped , breathing heavily against the wall , and closing his eyes again .
te	1	The heat and the anger struck his soul as it had struck his eardrums .
te	1	I thought I heard crying , and I know I felt a hand grab my wrist .
te	2	" One too many , " the older voice said roughly , and I stopped struggling to move .
te	3	I tried to lift my hand to rub them , and the pain made tears well up .
te	2	As before , Jai was across from me and Jo was next to me , both asleep or unconscious .
te	4	I wished I could see his bright red hair feathers one more time , but the coffin was closed .
te	2	Not ... " He looked at the food on his fork , then put it down .
te	1	" A silver dream , " he said , turning his fork over in his hands .
te	1	" I heard some of the officers talking ... They 're investigating the possibility of foul play . "
te	3	That train of thought led to another , and I sat up again after a moment .
te	0	I could see it from a distance , a faint miasma that made it almost look like a volcano .
te	3	I started up the mountain , testing each rock carefully with my foot before putting my weight on it .
te	2	I turned slowly in place , looking for another path up to the peak of the mountain .
te	3	It wasn 't much , as far as tributes went , but I found it oddly fitting .
te	0	He brightened so much I almost had to look away , but it made me laugh .
te	3	I stood for a moment at that point , looking at the larger footsteps that had belonged to Jay .
te	2	" I 'm looking through him , " I said out loud , and Jay grinned and nodded .
te	3	Jay just listened , until I recounted my excursion to the library and the paltry results that had yielded .
te	2	Look , Joey , I 'm not sure how much of this I should tell you . "
te	1	" Yes , sir , " he said , with more than a hint of irony .
te	3	They don 't want to rule all life , they want to wipe it out and start over . "
te	3	" But if they can destroy worlds that easily , why haven 't they won ? "
te	2	Sounds like she might be , too , from how she 's fixated on you . "
te	1	After struggling for a moment and coming up blank , I pushed it aside and moved on .
te	2	But you should go back home , at least long enough to see if they 've found anything . "
te	4	His laser was a better weapon than the light sword , but he wasn 't relying on the laser .
te	0	He raised his arm , laser engaging again , aimed - " Call me Joe , " I said .
te	1	We fell through nothing , and pain exploded once again in my shoulder as I landed on my back .
te	2	The air was clean and crisp , a little cool , tinged with a slightly acrid smell .
te	0	I would have just been glad to see her again , and forgotten all about Jay 's warning .
te	3	A figure walked past me and then split into two ; one went left , the other right .
te	1	I took her hand and pressed the flask into it , again enjoying knowing something she didn 't .
te	1	It 's the same kind of thing as my skin shield , just ... well , less advanced .
te	2	It was both sunny and cloudy , and dark storm clouds loomed off to the west .
te	4	If I looked closely , I could see rain falling around us , but we weren 't wet .
te	2	The ghostly figures still milled about , walking or jogging or falling , everywhere I looked .
te	0	She shook her head , then brought up a hand to rub her temple in frustration .
te	4	She scooted around so that her back was to mine and we were leaning against each other for support .
te	4	I felt her sigh , felt her hair brush against the back of my neck as she looked away .
te	3	My response was a laugh that came out a whole lot more bitter than I intended it to .
te	1	Everything was bright and clean and shining , the colors all soft and muted , beautifully luminescent .
te	2	After only a few rooms we stopped , and I was moved to some kind of gurney .
te	3	I didn 't much care ; I wasn 't really interested in attempting to run again .
te	1	Not if I were likely to run into more like him , which I imagined I was .
te	2	The room was empty , and I took this opportunity to look around as we walked .
te	3	I put a hand out , and it brushed against a firm wall that had the texture of static .
te	3	Some of the doors were still sealed , but it took no strength at all to pry them open .
te	4	The computer was off-line , the mechanisms just ordinary gears and wheels with nothing to lock them down .
te	1	I ran faster , bolting through the hallways and leaping over debris , through doors and around corners .
te	2	I couldn 't use the port room to warp back from here to there , could I ?
te	1	Colors were swirling uncertainly across Hue 's surface , and I got the impression he was thinking .
te	3	The colors swirled faster , mingling into a muddy brown that slowly shifted to a lighter red .
te	1	It felt like someone was covering me in Silly Putty , if you can imagine that .
te	2	It was like looking through a kaleidoscope that made string theory look like connect the dots .
te	3	It was about right then that I started wishing I 'd stopped to get a weapon .
te	0	Joaquim , however , was armed with a blaster and that weird miasma thing surrounding him .
te	1	It hit him square on , knocking him clear off his feet and out the window behind him .
te	4	Joaquim 's voice rang out , louder and somehow ... fuller than it had been before .
te	1	Acacia remained silent , stunned and uncertain , but I wasn 't paying attention to her .
te	1	I was looking at the little blue lights , the whirlwind of static and emotion surrounding him .
te	4	It was hard to tell whether he was being snide or genuine , but I really didn 't care .
te	0	There was the sound that was half static shock and half something snapping , and Joaquim reeled back slightly .
te	0	I was trapped by Binary , and nothing short of a miracle was going to get me out .
te	3	Without you , this would have taken months ... " I wanted to ask what this was .
te	2	His head drooped as though too heavy to hold up , his skin was pale and clammy looking .
te	4	he screamed , his voice barely audible above the whirring of machinery , the nightmarish chanting .
te	2	I used the souls as Joaquim had done , directing them to burn through my bonds .
te	0	The valley was beautiful ; the world around us was calm ; the sun was setting .
te	2	" I know you wanted to save him , " she said , not looking at me .
te	4	She paused for a moment , and her voice was very small when she spoke again .
te	3	" Do any of them speak with their mouths , or is that part of the intimidation factor ? "
te	2	" Nah , I gave up on that when you stood up to the Old Man . "
te	3	Shadows swept up in front of me , coalescing , forming strong hands that grabbed me by the throat .
te	3	I didn 't bother trying to break his grip ; he was too strong for that .
te	2	Instead , I snaked a hand down to my belt , going for my shield disk .
te	0	His grip was hard , but what worried me more was the way his fur felt against my skin .
te	1	Sharp teeth glinting in a fierce , canine grin , he twisted my wrist in his strong grip .
te	1	I could kill you , little fly , but I have something far better in mind . "
te	1	A small , tiny , faint glimmer of hope began to make itself known in my gut .
te	3	If he wasn 't going to kill me , whatever it was , I could get out of it .
te	3	At first I thought I was passing out , then I realized the ground was actually turning black .
te	4	I limped toward the intersection , breathing as deeply and as evenly as I could through the pain .
te	2	Jerzy 's voice echoed in my mind from long ago , one of the first conversations we 'd had .
te	3	I 'd Walked by accident the first time , and had drawn the attention of HEX .
te	1	I squared my shoulders , training taking over as I continued to move despite my injuries .
te	0	He rose to his feet , and ran his hands back through his thick curly hair .
te	4	Someone lifted me and carried me out of the house and into the crowd in the street .
te	1	That boy is possessed of a demon and I tell you my son was dead ! "
te	4	And these men are your neighbors , what 's happened to make you turn against them like this !
te	4	" We will leave for the Holy Land as soon as our few jobs are finished here .
te	4	" No , and it 's Greek that you 're teaching them , Scripture in Greek ! "
te	0	" It 's always the same , " said the Teacher with a great drawn-out sigh .
te	4	But there is no city outside of Rome as great as Alexandria where we are now .
te	0	" My lord , I do as my father and mother want , " I said .
te	4	At once all the family was speaking our native tongue for the first time in the whole afternoon .
te	4	" If we are Jews , shouldn 't we live in the land the Lord gave to us ?
te	3	I had always known this , but it wasn 't something to be said to anyone , ever .
te	4	In the darkness , I came up quietly on the courtyard , and I heard my mother crying .
te	2	" Some night , I 'll tell you all of it , " said my mother .
te	0	It was my fault , and even though everyone was happy , I felt sad and to blame .
te	2	I 'd find out some way , even though I had to do as Joseph said .
te	0	At last , I had to hear what they were saying , and moved away towards them .
te	1	But I tell you , it 's no time for all these pilgrim ships to be sailing . "
te	0	I didn 't know a thing about the new Herod , his son , who was Archelaus .
te	4	" You 'll hear stories about Herod 's deeds all your life , " Joseph said under his breath .
te	0	" My mother says Nazareth was once visited by an angel , " I told him .
te	4	In the House of Prayer , he would laugh when he thought the stories of the prophets were funny .
te	3	His cough came and went but he was hot all the time , and thirsty and restless .
te	0	But our family had stopped speaking Greek to others , and was using only the Aramaic .
te	4	I only knew we were moving little by little , and we were close to the walls .
te	2	My mother reached up and put her hand on my hip and I looked down at her and smiled .
te	4	" Jesus , come in so you can hear me if I whisper in your ear . "
te	3	Anointed , and then sent back to the flocks , a shepherd boy , wasn 't it ?
te	4	The families close to us were settled down , the women having gotten the little ones to sleep .
te	3	" This is why you didn 't want to go back there ... to Nazareth ? "
te	0	" No , Mamma , I do see , I understand , " I said at once .
te	1	I smiled a little smile I never gave to anyone but to her if it was giving .
te	4	I went up on my knees , and she did too , and she held me tight to her .
te	2	" I stretch forth my hands to you , Oh Lord , " my mother cried .
te	3	The man rolled onto his left side , and he stared right at us , right at me .
te	2	Little Salome was sobbing and sobbing , and nothing Aunt Mary said to her could comfort her .
te	2	" You will not say another word on this until we are out of Jerusalem ! "
te	3	James told us to stand still and be quiet , to hold on to the babies .
te	0	And he made sounds under his breath as if he was talking but he wasn 't talking .
te	0	And there was sweat all over his face now , and the day wasn 't hot .
te	4	At last the clans were all together , and Joseph and Zebedee led us out of the courtyard .
te	4	We could not stop to help anyone here any more than we could have stopped in the city .
te	2	My mother said , " We 'll be out in the hills soon , away from all this .
te	1	And when I saw these two looking at me , James and my cousin John , I stopped crying .
te	1	But I tried not to think of him because I knew I 'd start crying again .
te	1	People began to sing , but this time they sang mournful Psalms of pain and affliction .
te	0	I was so afraid , afraid and never never would I ever be not afraid as I was now .
te	3	They were all rushing back and forth , and fussing to get into the doorway to see it .
te	2	We sank down on the floor , and my cousin Elizabeth took my face and held it .
te	2	" We are passing through this , and we 'll be home soon , in our own house .
te	0	An angel had come before and an angel had come again , and an angel was here .
te	4	Little Salome crushed up against me and I hugged her tight as my mother hugged me .
te	3	But I knew , even at this moment , that the darkness of the night would come .
te	4	I didn 't feel it but I remembered it , and I knew it would come back .
te	1	I saw her gray hairs under the edge of her veil , running through her darker hair .
te	1	When I die , which will be soon - and no , don 't say that it won 't .
te	1	Am I not to provide for this child what I think the Lord will have ? "
te	3	" This is what I couldn 't write to you in a letter , " said Elizabeth .
te	1	" Come out with it , " he said , " or I may die without hearing it . "
te	4	You will see that no razor has ever touched his head , and he takes nothing of the grape .
te	1	My cousin Zechariah , a priest with gray hairs , being kicked by the soldiers of Herod .
te	0	And an old man who was sitting in the dirt beside a small house was laughing too .
te	3	" I said to them , ' Go on , brother , take it ! ' "
te	3	" Little daughter , if men want to fight , they find a reason , " he said .
te	1	" Once it was Cyrus the King who watched over us , now it 's Augustus Caesar .
te	0	But there had been a chance , and I was glad that Little Salome had spoken up .
te	0	She said , " This is my brother , " and she went with him alone .
te	3	Beyond the tall grass , it was red with the light of the sun that was almost gone away .
te	4	The cool air did not bother us , and we were soon warm and the water felt warm .
te	1	The whole river was full of singing , and those on the banks began to sing .
te	0	But I was dry and wrapped up and it was soft here , soft and close and dark .
te	4	" You fell down in the river , you were tired , you were praying and you were tired .
te	3	Why hadn 't I held on to the sight of them , and not let them go ?
te	1	That is , if I had a single thought of not being afraid , I missed the sea .
te	4	It was said the Roman soldiers were on the march from Syria , there was no question of it .
te	2	Two of the other women caught hold of her and took her away from the men .
te	2	I got up and went close to James , who was looking into the fire as he often did .
te	4	Some of the men were whispering their night prayers , heading for their beds under the sky .
te	0	Nothing changed in our camp , and it was the same for all those camped near us .
te	1	And with it I could hear feet running , faint and then loud , stomping feet .
te	4	Down below , in the valley , the fire burned but its great flames were finished .
te	4	Chapter 11 When i woke up , I saw the blue sky and the trees before I said anything .
te	1	But when I looked to Joseph as I always did at such times , he was steady .
te	1	I don 't see anything bad happening in Nazareth , and nothing between here and there . "
te	1	Rattling and scratching and the sound of men calling in Greek words I couldn 't make out .
te	1	" You just said yourself we can 't search all these houses , now let 's go . "
te	2	" You know , we had to put this down , this rebellion , you do know that .
te	0	And now half the city burnt and the slave traders dragging away the women and children . "
te	4	One of the other soldiers was quietly scoffing , and the mean soldier held his peace .
te	0	The leader looked at us and at the old woman as if he was speaking but he wasn 't .
te	3	As they had come , they went - with a lot of noise and clatter , and rattling .
te	2	I could hear but the cooing of doves , and the soft song of other birds .
te	2	Joseph spoke in a low voice to James , " What did you see from the rooftops ? "
te	2	Old Justus raised his hand , and tried to sit up on his bed but he couldn 't .
te	0	Then he lay back on his bed , and I saw that he couldn 't speak .
te	4	The other men came to Old Sarah one by one and kissed her hands and she received them .
te	0	She frowned and shook her head and said in a whisper that I mustn 't speak of it .
te	2	Others were coming and going on the road as people do and I saw wagons , and donkeys .
te	3	At once Little Symeon came out from behind the curtain of the doorway , and so did Little Judas .
te	2	She took care of Old Justus and Old Sarah , and she slept on the floor in their room .
te	2	Everyone knew it could take two days or more for a man to die on a cross .
te	2	" The last of the soldiers passed on the main road over an hour ago , " said Joseph .
te	3	It was damp there , because it had rained in the night , but it was good .
te	1	It was as if I was humming and the humming filled my ears , but I wasn 't humming .
te	3	What was time that I could spend it here staring until the world lost all its hard edges ?
te	1	A chill lingered , and I didn 't like it but I knew the warm air was coming soon .
te	4	Here they were up early to bake the bread and no one brought the water here .
te	3	" They fasted , they put on sackcloth from the greatest among them to the least .
te	2	' Do you do well to be so angry over the death of a vine ? ' "
te	2	My uncle Simon stood close to me too and he put his hand on my shoulder too .
te	2	Joseph said , " Come now , Yeshua , how long am I to look at this troubled face ?
te	3	My teeth were chattering and my mother thought I was cold , but I wasn 't .
te	2	That she was trying to go from my house to the house of her mother-in-law ? "
te	0	" Be careful in what you write on that wall , " said my aunt Salome .
te	4	We laughed at that , and we did move on and back to the peace of the countryside .
te	1	And my aunt , his wife , said , " His talk is better than his singing .
te	1	And if there 's a psalm with an ant in it , he will sing it . "
te	1	My uncle started to sing , and my aunt groaned , but soon we were singing with him .
te	0	" But you know a holy man can make the rain come and go , " he said .
te	2	I didn 't say a word to anyone , but I was troubled , deeply troubled .
te	3	" Is it not for the fathers of the children to tell them these things in time ? "
te	0	" And Old Sarah daughter of Elias was with them , and Old Justus was not infirm . "
te	0	" If he had you for an accuser , he 'd have gray hairs aplenty ! "
te	0	" It was Elijah who was taken up , and Elijah is with the Lord . "
te	1	The Rabbi spoke in Aramaic , " Why did the Lord break his covenant with King David ? "
te	0	" Tell me how the Lord is a carpenter , " said the Old Rabbi in Aramaic .
te	2	" This is a good child , " he said , looking at Joseph above me .
te	0	I 'd had enough and gave the bowl to James but he didn 't want any .
te	4	It was said he had become a Pharisee only after he could no longer go to the Temple .
te	1	But even then we were all talking or singing , and I couldn 't really think .
te	2	I wanted to go off the road and wander in the woods , but we couldn 't do this .
te	4	It turned out four of us , and then five were bedded down in the same room .
te	2	" What I want to know is ... what do you think you 're doing here ? "
te	0	He had his hand to his face , and he was looking at me through his fingers .
te	1	Crying , yes , but watching me , and it filled me with terrible misery to look at him .
te	4	Before us , instead of the blue sea , I saw suddenly the great courtyard of the Temple .
te	1	I heard his voice in my ear : " I 'm watching you , angel child ! "
te	1	" They 're my brothers and sisters , " I said , " as it 's always been . "
te	0	His face was calm as if all the crying had gone away and left him empty .
te	3	But here in the Land , it was the custom to do these things according to the Law .
te	3	I could hear something that was like the grass growing , but it wasn 't that , I knew .
te	3	" I can 't do it because Joseph doesn 't want me to do it . "
te	1	" Joseph has forbidden me to ask questions of him , even to ask questions . "
te	3	He stood up and looked out over the fields at the mountains rising to the east and the west .
te	3	If I try to tell you things , your father will put me out of the house for it .
te	4	How can the Temple be rebuilt and purified if the Romans don 't bring order to Jerusalem ?
te	4	The thieves and the rebels stand on the cloisters and shoot their arrows in the very Temple .
te	0	I 'd have a Roman peace , yes , a peace such as we had in Alexandria .
te	3	It 's not that ... it 's all the rest of it , the lawlessness , the ruin . "
te	3	I wanted to tell him about the strange dream I 'd had but I couldn 't .
te	1	And who would understand the night near the Jordan , the beings around me in the dark ?
te	3	Many women of the village came to talk to my mother and watch her with this loom .
te	4	And she almost surely knew of the hard questions put to Joseph when I was taken into the school .
te	3	All this about my mother 's fearfulness I hadn 't really put together in my mind until it changed .
te	4	The women of our house crushed olives in a small press for the purest oil at home .
te	0	And then we would sing it out after him : We are the people of Abraham and Isaac .
te	4	And we are a holy people , a people of priests , a people of the Law .
te	0	We are a people of great Kings - Saul , and David , and Solomon , and Josiah .
te	0	And on the head of the High Priest was a great turban with a golden crown .
te	1	On this day , the High Priest laid hands upon the bullock to be sacrificed for Israel .
te	0	I knew what a palace was , as surely as I knew what a pagan temple was .
te	0	He was smiling , but I think he was smiling because he hadn 't thought of this before .
te	0	And she had the bright eyes of a child , the trust of a child , my mother .
te	4	She looked at me , and ran her hand over my hair as she often did .
te	4	And the beasts kept us very warm , while the tenants froze in the rooms above . "
te	3	It was dark and chilly but it felt good after the close warmth of the house .
te	3	My mother got up to tend to them , and then called for Joseph to help .
te	1	It was only Old Justus coughing because his throat was so weak that he couldn 't swallow .
te	4	His smile grew bigger , and he led me out to feel the snowflakes for myself .
te	4	When we arrived , we found the little house where we 'd stayed shuttered and vacant .
te	2	I loved the smell of her wool robe , and the soft touch of her hand .
te	2	I was far too old now , I thought , to ask anyone to carry me .
te	3	High on the walls , the soldiers walked , and I tried not to look at them .
te	3	Her hands were tight and twisted at the wrists , so that they pointed sharply downward .
te	4	Then Old Sarah and the uncles went in to see Elizabeth before it was too late .
te	0	" They 're rich from the hides of the sacrifices which are theirs by right , " said Joseph .
te	2	" We haven 't been here two hours and you women know who Joseph Caiaphas is going to marry !
te	2	" If you weren 't so busy quoting the Prophets , you 'd know it too . "
te	1	The House of Caiaphas brought us a thick porridge of lentils with lots of spice in it .
te	0	But I thought of my cousin John bar Zechariah who 'd gone off with the Essenes .
te	4	Finally I left the boys , even though I wanted to play , and I found Joseph .
te	3	It took me a moment and then I said : " It doesn 't hurt me . "
te	4	You had a boy 's face then , and your eyes were like your mother 's eyes . "
te	4	Only long enough for you to be circumcised and the sacrifice to be made at the Temple .
te	0	Later that night , as I lay on my blanket , I closed my eyes and prayed .
te	1	No , they had not been born of a woman who had never been with a man .
te	0	He had his hand on James 's shoulder as he guided him and us through the crowd .
te	3	" Well , if you want to buy two birds , then you change to this ! "
te	2	a man said to a woman who stood over him , who seemed not to understand his Greek .
te	2	The money changers waved him away without much of a look , and Joseph pressed him to stop .
te	2	" Listen , you have to let us pay for another pair of doves for you ! "
te	2	" I don 't give the money to you , " he said to the woman .
te	0	It was a dark and almost sad sound that flowed on and on with great power .
te	3	That 's up , past the singers , in the Sanctuary , and beyond the great veil .
te	2	If only the magi had not told Herod ... My mother 's words came back to me .
te	3	But I didn 't want these thoughts , these fragments of something that I couldn 't complete .
te	0	Such a peace and happiness took hold of me that I was scarcely a boy standing there among others .
te	4	It was a dark and beautiful thing like the music rising , and the prayers spoken everywhere in Hebrew .
te	3	I took it and ran at once to sit down at the feet of the man .
te	1	" And who is this who gives me so much , and comes to sit at my feet ? "
te	0	And Caesar Augustus , what did he say of Herod after the man had slain his two sons ?
te	2	I cannot give up those I copied myself , or those copied so carefully according to the Law .
te	1	If only I knew that it was right , if only , but I had promised .
te	2	" It 's good for you to see it when it 's not so full of people .
te	2	Now all this time Joseph had not said one word to me about the blind man .
te	1	I hadn 't known it when we hurried down the stairs that evening , but I knew it now .
te	2	He had a fair crowd of young boys around him , some much older than me .
te	0	He had a quick laugh that was friendly and kind ; but there was a sharp authority in him .
te	2	The library was very big , bigger than that of Philo , and full of scrolls .
te	3	" So that you may put it out of your mind and be done with it .
te	4	" These magi , as you call them , these wise men , they came to Jerusalem .
te	4	Herod had received these men , pretended that he wanted to know who this King might be himself . "
te	0	I saw the man , our man , in the Temple with the spear through his chest .
te	0	And once when I did , it was dark , and the old Rabbi was asleep in his chair .
te	3	I thought at once of the murdered children , but I could see it without crying .
te	4	" The child born in Bethlehem has been dead for eight years , as you said yourself .
te	0	And in that moment , I felt all my sadness , all my separation from those around me .
te	4	The Rabbi praised my answers to his questions , when I had been with the other boys .
te	3	Everything that was in the room was still there but it was filled with the light .
te	3	Oh , not the weight of the baby that comes later , or the movement , no .
te	3	And it wasn 't the angel who came to me , who filled the room with light , no .
te	0	But it was an angel and the angel had told him to take me as his wife .
te	0	He wouldn 't tell me why - only that an angel had come to him again in a dream .
te	4	Then finally we went back north up to Alexandria and settled in the Street of the Carpenters .
te	3	I struggled not to cry , not to fear , not to tremble - only to wait .
te	2	" Joseph said to me , ' No , the blood is not on our hands .
te	2	Chapter 26 From the mount of olives , we took the last look back on the city of Jerusalem .
te	3	I could see that they were pleased but they didn 't want to talk about what had happened .
te	3	And when will the angels come to me with such bright light that I am not afraid of it ?
te	2	I would go out into the world and do what it was I was meant to do .
te	3	More generally , it was the birth of Christianity and the fall of the ancient world .
